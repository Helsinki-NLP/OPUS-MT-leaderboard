Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “look like torturers”
Some of the members of the Assembly are discouraged by the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could become a laughing stock.
One of the Labourers said that his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with the Top and the Deep."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "not persuaded" to change the name, but noted that the new name of the CFP (MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to "moppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the draft law to amend the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names with which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves”.
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the role of its members, the Commission prefers ‘Members of the Parliament of Wales,’ in short ‘CPU’, but the ‘CUP’ option has received the most support after questioning the public.
Members of the Assembly are offering alternative options, but reaching a consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which he is expected to submit a draft bill for the change to several weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach a debate on the bill.
The Macedonian people will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is planned to resolve an ongoing decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, has said he will not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells staggered against the difficulties of churches in Harlem
“If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner,” Adams said.
“They’re both gone today.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he added.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s living rooms, where everyone gets together on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not reach as long as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will be in the same situation.”
The man added that the churches could be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live who do not help the survival of the other sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built of white pastures before Harlem became the Black Quarter – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and “St. Martin” a decade later.
The original white methodical herd was carried out in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
“St. Martin” was sung by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as the servicemen did not want to give to us.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy losses in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drafted a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool”.
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the 18-year-old Reversey church.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin has never replaced him.
What has been played out in St. Martin’s over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought to life by the world leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
From the vestry – which is the governing body of the pasha, consisting of world leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the costs of the vestry”, even though it did not have a role in the suffrage of the suffrage.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old child injured by shark in California otter hunt
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it sank for lobster in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beycon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends around half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and walked in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a hummingbird and was excited, then realized how he was shouting “Hang me!
Get me!"
Hamel says that when he got to the boy, he found out that the whole area of his key had been torn apart.
“I asked everyone to get out of the water because there’s a shark,” Hamel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Gilles said in a media briefing that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the water, but was deemed not to be of a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of her body.
The authorities have closed access to the coast line from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours on safety grounds while the investigation is underway.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an attack on the UK market for beauty products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening booths for beautiful products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty product market, the country will be valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and will continue to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest so far stands for beauty products will be 11.
The investment curve in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the racks, recently occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of beauty products on offer to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its boutique range of make-up, so most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing discount programs at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract shoppers.
Mike Coup, chief executive officer of Sainsbury, said the facilities will look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to compete with the Aldi and Lidl counters, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury has Argos facilities in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats facilities since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased food sales and made profits even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to reshape its facilities for beautiful and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 properties to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
From there, they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the nature and nature of our beautiful stands to enhance the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and every need in a convenient location, with this combination turning us into an attractive destination for beautiful products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘crazy’ after Holly Wileby’s refusal to sign a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons star Peter Jones has become “crazy” after television host Holly Willaby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for the brand of household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to Guinet Poltrou's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old leader of “This Morning” announced her departure from Instagram.
Holly Willaby left the Dragons Den star Peter Jones “to kick in” after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – focusing on her own new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “crazy” when the TV’s “golden girl” admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of cash — meant he didn’t have more time.
The business is similar to Guinet Poltrou’s Goop brand, with rumors that it has doubled Willaby’s fortune, the value of which is projected at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the brewery absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
At the Marlowe plant, there is a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading “This Morning”, which is one of the UK’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as to give the company millions.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willaby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Kap for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, and Jones, who is 52, joined the company as chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willaby will become the M&S brand’s “messenger” and will also replace Anne Mcparlin as the host of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Tough Talks Lead to ‘Relationship Warming’
He joked about the criticism he would take from the news channels about making a comment that someone would consider “inappropriate for the president” and too positive for North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his joking “newspaper” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump "a major step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "doesn't see any reciprocity" from the United States to its first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. continues with the sanctions, which are aimed at maintaining the tension.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relations with North Korea are wonderful,” he said.
“We have gone to war with this country.
Millions of people were going to die.
Instead, we’re now enjoying a great relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – ending missile tests, liberating hostages and returning the bodies of U.S. military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and led to the deaths of hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unambiguous opinion that there is no need for international assistance, which makes things a little bit challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While “Save the Children” is set up by a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although asylums were built in Aceh in the case of tsunamis, they are not common sight on the other shores.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has set sail for Palu, but it will take at least three days before he can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia’s remaining infrastructure at the center of his election campaign, investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly hampering his office, while Joko is back on the run the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other first-class weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturgeon Brings Late Equality to Liverpool vs Chelsea <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Daniel Sturgeon saved Liverpool from a loss in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturgeon received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then fired a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the plunger to Kepa Arisabalaga and wrapped herself in fearlessly in the net.
“I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shack are always looking for forward positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw the setting Kante, I pushed my ball and I just shot without thinking too much.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar.
The Blues striker gave a fifth to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then sprinted from the middle of the pitch to the middle of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> quickly exchanged double delivery in the center.
He then released a quick shot pass, with which he took Azar to a clean position in the penal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left leg in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency earlier on Sunday.
Many people have been trapped in the ruins of buildings, squabbles after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the news agency, told a news conference.
The town of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is dotted with ruins of crumbling buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation has been launched into the murder after a woman's body was found this morning in Burkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with injuries from John Street's Grayson Mouse stabbing, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for help from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all those who have been close to John Street in Burkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information on the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and that she was found in a private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends, who consider the woman their friend, arrived at the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mieze, tried to return to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man was silent when he found out about what had happened.
Residents are told that it will take hours for them to be allowed to return home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
She kept saying, “That’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border, while another van remained outside.
There are police officers at the border who are watching the housing block.
All persons with information are kindly requested to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue has become the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that have been carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the "Society of Cromwell" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove Oliver Cromwell’s statue to the Palace of Westminster to become a target.
The economic struggle of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person, which represents one side of the resulting separation.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.”
A pig-killer injures a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a bone in the Liupanshui market in Guangzhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pigeon was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005, in Sinin, Xinhai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also bolted the door to the next door open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody calf in the carriage.
The forensics expert confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked the farmer mortally, the report said.
“My cousin’s leg was bleeding and disfigured,” said Brother Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it could not attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan’s family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although they are rare, it has been previously reported that pigs are attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig was attacked by a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, and after the attack, the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had driven a Welsh farmer to his tractor, while his wife managed to drive him away.
After an oregano farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of the blood may act as a “drop.”
“They just play.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But a man must treat them with respect," the man concluded.
Debilitating Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and torrential rains in the southwestern part of the United States
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to torrential rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane at 5am Sunday morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific began to form a synclinal, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push the squid into the tropics.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synchlinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At a local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, caused debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to falls of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
It is possible to have flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a ditch in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to elevated dust and gusts of wind.
The approaching cyclone will lead to heavy rains in some parts of California’s southern coast.
It is possible to reach falls of more than half an inch, which will lead to minor waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
In the late Sunday and early Monday scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona, before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October could bring major temperature fluctuations in the U.S. as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail at around 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the eye-catching spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
During this time, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular round-the-clock programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck and that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been pressured into drinking and had tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has not happened.
It’s likely even more than Nielsen’s reported number of 20.4 million viewers had watched the witness on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no directly available data on the other networks that broadcast the audition, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
In comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican came out of the office with a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed Friday how he was played by protesters while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Commission.
During the entire braking for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he represents the truth to the state?
“You have power while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake responded that his office had already issued a statement, and before closing the elevator doors he said he would make an additional statement during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a close live coverage a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh’s nomination to the attention of the full Senate for a vote.
Alla Fleik said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which Democrats in opposition insist.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Party senator Chris Kuhns.
After a conversation with Queens and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely important, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political stakes" with Britain's future and in undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that the "collection of the Ethic and the Ethician customs" was a proposal.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspected Ditton Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police are arresting a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Ditton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the police department in Batton Rouge said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS' WAFB branch reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting of Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
Button Rouge’s East Court Medical Service released a preliminary report on Friday, in which a gunshot wound to the head and neck was cited as the cause of the death.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police’s refugee search department, the Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents for the help they had provided in the investigation, which contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “timely justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6-foot and 6-inch player grew up in Batton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 touchdowns.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “It’s something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepétel volcano reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed many tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust that covers the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example, in Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie, when thousands joined in opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the Gendarmerie, began freezing the world's guards with eggs and powder paint, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually swarmed with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other clashes with the police, as the police resorted to their sticks to take control of the situation.
For hours in support of independence, groups chanted “We do not forget, we do not forgive” while those who declared to preserve the country’s integrity returned with “Spain forever”.
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the desired independence region even a year after a referendum on October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalans.
The vast majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the split boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
The independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a stagnation."
Despite the marked important victory, it was with little difference that the regional elections in December, which supported the independence of Catalonia's political parties experienced difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders were either in self-imposed exile or in arrears.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, said the conflict had been provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of the democratic values and the repressions that we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested Men After Car Crashed In A House
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car several times crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that there has been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that he was shot in the car with an arball.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston surprised Rangers and only made a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the club from Aibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team equalled points with the second in the Hibernian rankings.
Gerard's team remains unbeaten on foreign ground in the Premier League this season, and next week he faces head coach Harts, from which he is eight points behind in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against uninvited guests
Holt's team had to lead the score well before scoring a goal, and his direct style of play made it extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow went away, after which Alan Litgow shot across the chest after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they can seriously complicate guests from static situations.
And that’s how I got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and led Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
By this time, Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced the unbeatable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pitman's leg with a kick, and Litlow's head shot past the door after another static situation for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, however, the centers were rolled, which were easy to clean, and the judge twice failed to comply with the guests' demands for a duel - first after a fight between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then with doubts about playing with the hand.
"Penomental" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lambont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and the squad almost did not change after the return of the team to the Premier League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle under tension all the time.
At the same time, Rangers did not show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were very much below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once they managed to break the defense of the hosts – this loss must wake Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiling and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cooling down due to problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey’s admission into the EU.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented the 25,000-strong crowd from rallying in front of the mosque, but nevertheless many supporters gathered around them who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the break-up caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
A road accident in Deptford: A cyclist rests after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the driver died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The police in the capital have announced that its employees are working on identifying the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Superintendents Injured in Interment
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security male prison riot, according to a report by the Prison Service.
The riot broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano squad are called upon, who will have to deal with eight deprived of liberty, as the meddling itself in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained staff have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
The six supervisors received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that their sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the attack of a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the anti-aircraft units were summoned to the prison, where they were to take control of a heavy riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although droughts may be beneficial)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but it’s likely that this will happen early next week, while the debilitating hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert to the southwest, leading to a risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established anti-glare posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, and in late Monday it could bring rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of overruns being possible in some places.
For those who are not threatened by flash floods, the Rose-induced rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Commission on Monitoring of Drought Periods, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second-heavy category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
As a result, it is expected to reach the mainland of Mexico by the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of flooding.
“Summary rains are expected to be up to 6 inches from the Bay of California to the Northwest Sonora, and up to 10 inches are possible,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until Tuesday late at night.
“The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in the Bay of California, northwest Sonora, and desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and carrying various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain terrains.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was admitted to a hospital where his condition remained “stable”.
On the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to them to get in touch with them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been “affected by the greed and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party’s deceptive and outrageous tactics,” Trump told a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "affected by the ugliness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing of the indictment.
The president made a statement on Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities” of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a great reputation in the service of the public,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly targeted Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
Although I’m not a candidate, in fact I’m also involved,” Trump continued.
“That’s why I’m running and fighting for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves up for a mission “to hinder and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, as one of the senior Republican Party officials told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims has increased.
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were carried away by shallow coastal giant waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA> on Friday, when on the evening the coast was marked by waves up to six feet (18 feet) high, took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami peaked after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the threat of tsunamis rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, as a result of which many became victims of the disaster,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Inaugural Overcoming Agency, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had dragged cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at the 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the disaster agency, images of the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and collapsed bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The secondary coves continued to lull the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the Hiroshima nuclear bomb dropped during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huge” and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the trout.
He also added that "the communications are completely interrupted and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, for its part, said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already made their way to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not informing about the hit Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Shared on social media, amateur clips show a man on the upper floor of a building screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and treats both cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which halted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of first necessity.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
As World Vision staff from Donggala managed to safely reach Palu, where they found refuge in brevet shelters scattered in the yard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and rescue operations by emergency groups, some complain that foreign rescuers with rich experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The poverty is still at a regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there it has not yet declared such a status.”
As the second night falls over Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“As an elder in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the crash of the hotel "Roa-Roa" reached the community on paragliding, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, instead of a pair of blue markings, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Stealers raise $26,750 while charging a ATM in Levi's Newport
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from a Brink employee who loaded a ATM in Levy's Newport, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came running around behind Brink’s employee’s back” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed her name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been wearing the cover for some time and has been used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He switched singer Ariana Grande to the show, which she refused "for emotional reasons," the show's creator told us.
In addition to being a shortening of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘she’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where ‘you’ or ‘you’ means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Cania, which means only one person, simply to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence.”
Rapper is one of the many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferences to the pseudonyms Leo and Brader Leo.
One of West’s previous collaborators, Jay Zi, also presented himself in a variant with or without a dash and/or capital letters in his pen.
Mexico's president vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread among Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front lines of artificial intelligence development, the U.S. needs to double its research budget in this area, said AI researcher and developer Kai-fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government entities made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one innovator in AI by 2030.
“The doubling of the AI development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the U.S. and are about to make further breakthroughs on AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances of the next major AI achievement coming from the U.S., as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest AI companies in China – Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon Lee worked on an AI system that beat the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee blames the federal government’s previous technological competitions, such as the Agency’s Robotics Competition for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asks when the next one will be, which will help to identify the new visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to earn funding from the government,” Lee said.
"China does not take away academic leaders, but corporations," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think that the AI doctors should automatically offer green cards,” the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the crop and academic environments, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noticed any activity in months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve an ongoing decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoed its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while at the same time the boycott campaign cast a shadow over whether the referendum would be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The issue of the bulletins reads as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price deserves to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the breakup of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have said that they will comply with the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of MPs must vote for it.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Giosse Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will find the way to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents, which were bullied by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after releasing his own vote.
He also said that the positive result will lead to “affirming the future of our people.”
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of a study, according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a case on Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's victory 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's replay of his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He ran over three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left behind the others at the border of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with a right-footed blow, overcame Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries to his feet,” City Pep Guardiola’s manager told reporters.
“We were going to play 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at this point.”
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the Premier League of England.
He signed up in the 29th minute.
In the situation of naked Aguero received a submission deep into half of Brighton.
He immediately released an exiting pass on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The assailant of the "heavens" was able to spot near, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no particular meaning for another game of the titular starting pitcher.
And yet the ever-ambitious Chercer hopes to be a titleholder on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the match is significant for the Rockies, who lead a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West rankings.
The Rockies secured at least a Wild Card match after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still not sure they will win their first division title.
“Although we are not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game for them this year.
“Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it is expected that they will allow Chercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Chercer, this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, he held a training session on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a 18-7 balance with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to recruit supporters in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
President Koso hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I’m not a candidate, I’m really involved too, that’s why I’m fighting with all my might for the right candidates,” Trump said.
Then he went on to say, “You all see this terrible, horrifying radical group of democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself are witnesses to their dishonesty, to evil.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to overcome to get into power and government, because they only care about power and government, but we won’t give them to them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal of “obstructing and obstructing.”
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “angry, ugly, mean and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Dayan Finnstein by name, which caused a strong outcry from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting — it was a really cool gesture — perhaps the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labradorists are no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last member of parliament by the Labour Party who was told he wasn’t welcome – just because I’m speaking out.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude, as she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed at the time of previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that "we wish the meetings to include all and be useful."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, the Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises for a “lighter and more moderate” policy has long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party’s leadership liked it.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree with – either on national security or on the one hand.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say in fact – there is an all-in-one excruciating tirade on social media, where it is called for reference, rejection of moderate politics, statements that it does not belong to the Labour Party.
That doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of truth, I know that I have even more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are at least of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist bribes every day without being afraid of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such attempts have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labourers should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer broad-minded, with any sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrow.
Over the past two years, I’ve received many tips on how to do it, not to say so much, and that then “everything will be fine.”
That’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thacher government, which, by ignoring it, led to a literal disintegration of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a miniskirt or as a counselor.
I have never held my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state is aiming for Brexit, it will harm households, firms and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leaders.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of recall or political expulsion will stop me from acting in the way that I think best interests you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air Leads to Ranking
The two late essays may have slightly changed the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from the Tennent High League.
The team is already leading the rankings and the only of the ten teams is unbeaten so far.
The better protection and better use of the opportunities were decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us very seriously in the past matches, and we're still without a loss," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their situation better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow to Frazier Klimo, led Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Huss, released to play in the game by the Warriors, allowed the score to follow Barlow's draw, followed by a replay of the
Climo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick just before halftime, noting an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional hit, making the result 17-5 for Air on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's ace, followed by a successful additional strike at Bagot, reduced the lead by just five points.
There followed a prolonged halt to the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, who was put on a stretcher, and after the replay of the game Air increased their lead after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional hit by Klimo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McFarson received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and executing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional strike.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after he knocked out Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent penalty shootout McFarson realized an essay with the help of Air's advancing offensive line.
Climo realized the additional blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball kicked by David Armstrong and pulled out the wing of Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth round of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to have headed for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphile.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final one for the show, with Kirnan apparently already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow’s “promoting restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s lack of access to the sea hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are constantly patrolling the moorings with the crew at La Paz.
Above the public buildings there is an ocean blue flag.
The seabeds from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are embroidered with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It’s our responsibility to get it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which does not have access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict is still alive – as is the call to once again sail from the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation have already passed.
“Strength is in Bolivia, there is wisdom and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the verdict of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia’s demand and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic local president, who is due to go to a contested re-election battle next year, has also staked a lot and a lot on the court’s judgment on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific,” Morales said last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it judged in its favor, it wouldn't change things in reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to take the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been dispelled by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales's military rhetoric had eliminated and the few remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have a normal dialogue after the incident.
The two sides have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" as well as a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefit for both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political paterina”.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never resort to nuclear weapons first if it was not able to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing parties in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of relaunching the unprecedented nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore’s meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri called the idea "empty hope" that continuing U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would cause the North to fall to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration, without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about their abandonment of an arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange preparations for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest tip on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which rocked the fashion podium during Paris Fashion Week.
The rather impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their eye-catching creations to make the fashion community laugh.
Valentino’s outstanding proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other too huge accessories included jewelry dines, magic hats, and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of the upper fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in full set with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, then you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will soon be sold at the fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after “La Bomba” – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design on the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the one wearing it with a swimsuit.
The raffle bag with the color of a burnt orange, with raffles of raffle and a white leather handle, was the all-seeing item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for hydro-seobarite.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in the sports disciplines, the arts, and the general music.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can set up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language we understand about him, then your words can get to him.
But if you speak in his own language, you touch his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that the languages are in the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
The data, collected by 74 members of SCIS schools, showed that 72% of the students achieved an A rating in Chinese, with 72% of the students being German, 69% of the students being French and 63% of those being Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for in the future.
Currently, languages as subjects of free choice on the part of students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK’s Employment and Labour Skills Commission found that, for reasons that employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% said they have insufficient language skills.
Therefore, more and more the mastery of foreign languages becomes necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more working positions require the mastery of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essentials in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person has mastered a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the dominant couple of languages in front of the competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 UK senior citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reaches a double-digit percentage of 1 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Having a few languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait was almost over for fans who were eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the team's first game of pre-season training against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play in a duel.
“He’ll be on the pitch in between one and 48 minutes,” said Walton via Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau said in a tweet that James was likely to play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers pre-season preparation.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-election rallies tonight in Wieling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies, which include stops at well-known locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying his vote to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened by a loss of control over Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wellington, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wellington, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week’s hearings on Supreme Court nominees Brett Cavano, in which tensions have emerged over allegations of immoral sexual acts that hold the Senate’s affirmative vote to one week while a country’s investigation is underway.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans build momentum for the November elections.
That’s why in President Donald Trump’s campaign it was announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season filled with commitments,” a spokesman for Trump’s campaign said in a statement.
The rally, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wellington, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month will be the state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in sociological studies.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological studies,” said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive ahead of the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without a Foursom intrigue, Sunday afternoon games may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, in which, however, players trust unreservedly, even more in competitions like this one.
Which team is in a better position right now?
“They led by six points, and now they’re only four, so I guess we’ve got a little inertia,” said Jordan Spitt at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve points left for distribution.
However, as Spit says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sport of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spit shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The fans' cheering voices grew stronger as he advanced in a round in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth match, after together with Thomas they were left with two strokes after the first two holes.
His strike, which won their 15th hole game, was met with strong backlash that led us to believe that not everything was really lost to the American team.
“The important thing is that you don’t think about anything else and focus on your own game,” Spitt says.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed heroes of Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but adoring couple from Europe have won four out of four and seem to get everything.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These consistent successes, as well as the way in which it seems that energy was passing between them and the enthusiastic golfers, have confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, who will bring the potential victory over Europe.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European fame turned out to be a bit premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" matches of the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
“Gods” and two “dolls” of the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swede into problems they couldn’t cope with.
On Sundays, however, there is no other way to solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Foursome" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they exchange between each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any given moment.
The Europeans played a better team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “foursome” matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead 10–6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup, having led the U.S. 10–6 after playing matches from the Fourball and Foursom formats on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with their Le Golf National race assets growing by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" matches over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series 3–1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the Foursham games, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points from Sunday's 12th singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Moliwood", after this sensational weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Raed's history.
After unappealingly beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the "four-ball" games, they were extremely motivated to beat broken Woods and American rookie Brian Decamp with an even more categorical 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely went through both games on Saturday, only occasionally showed bursts of his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses out of 29 matches in “Fourball” and “Foursome” matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who took a break for the morning "fourball" matches, partnered with Henry Stanson in the "foursome" matches in a 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copca, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2–1 win against Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the "four-ball" games, and later came back to beat Polter and Rory Machillroy with 4&3 in the "foursom" matches, although they lost the first two.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a four-point deficit has occurred before the singles, and according to the rules, Furik's team will hold the trophy even if it is equal.
However, after being raised in two consecutive days, their chances of returning on Sunday seem to be not particularly high.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen distrust of the United States and there is no way for the country to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong-hou said that in the past year “significant measures of goodwill” have been taken, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the facility for nuclear tests and promises not to spread nuclear and nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will there be a way to disarm unilaterally first.”
While Ri was expressing North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “stage” approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, which North Korea would be rewarded for as it took step-by-step measures, his statement did not seem to be a significant one.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for a "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump's
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the relief of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “first removing nuclear weapons” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes “the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The realization that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting is planned between Kim and Trump, for which the U.S. leader stressed at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula has not been done.
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the continental U.S. is inevitable after “bad president” Trump called the “man-killer” Kim.
That year at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removed it.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if it will take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must necessarily continue until a full, final and confirmed execution is carried out.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri in the co-chairs of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July with the words that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of sending “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an effort to tackle the growing culture of learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
A teacher found that students at the number one university in the world often do not even think when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Caissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, prepared the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Another girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this right now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students what is most essential about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university has decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another part of the participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Caissler.
The culture of pride from “learning all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing adequate and high-quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid overcrowding, as sleep deprivation brings the brain into a mode of hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Caissler prepare the course by taking one of his first-year classes at Harvard.
He says his course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Caissler advises students to think about setting up a sleep and wake-up alarm and to know the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and cause the problem to occur.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal smashes Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's undefeated team and brought a 1–0 win over Livingston.
The Aibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of the triumph in February with 4–1 over St. John's, but Gary Holt's team only made Gerard's second defeat in his 18th game as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas Rangers' team at no point seemed close to equalizing.
After the match, the Rangers finished in sixth place, and Livingston finished in third, leaving Hibernian second only in the lead.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems as side judge Calum Spence received a head wound after he was hit with an item that was apparently thrown by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with Livingston's same single-seater, which scored a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team matched all the opponent's actions.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They had to score in the second minute, when Menga took a touch of Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs's centering from the foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow deflected the ball away from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but were unable to create anything substantive in the final third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a duel in the 15th minute when he faced Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers scored only two straight shots in the first half, but former Eibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily managed to hit Lassana Kulibali's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livy's 34th-minute touchdown was surprising given the possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly gave it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to a result when the wing submitted to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable home style of play, with Litgow and Halket constantly repelled the forward long balls.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs's blow, and at the subsequent corner Litgoo fired his head off the fence.
Entering as a reserve Glen Middleton of Rangers requested a duel at the end of the duel after a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
A page from our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROWN... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the Gayger counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "Coronado's Bells" was released, in which seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: "What, for God's sake, is this
Rogers: This is a gauge counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones together, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s definitely shooting right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery, which bears his name, continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and inject itself back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Betez, Maryland: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “learning” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat that read, “Let’s make America great again,” while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a meaningless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the caption "Let's Make America Great Again", he turned against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people very often and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have long since left America," he said.
The SNL began the show with the participation of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star rose to the testimony of Brett Cavan in front of the Senate Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blazi Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's performance recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to upstage West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was shocked behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been bitten!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?”, claiming that he will wear Superman’s costume, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try it with love.”
The comments caused at least twice as much public outcry and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, telling one of them, “The whole studio was silent.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU, THAT YOU HAVE SEEN A HAPPY CHILD.”
The show's lead singer Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was simply "being herself and that's great."
“But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s who we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Buffy, Buffy, and P. Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lane, and the musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor's office.
The star of "Game of Thrones" Keith Harington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of The Game of Thrones NGO.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, has filed a lawsuit against the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think they need to be “crazy” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something was wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner in the "Game of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "very confident" that this problem needs to be solved.
“Right now I’m personally very convinced – what have we confused about manhood?” he said.
“What do we teach young men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness due to the many male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel that they need to become this particular type of man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how to change it?
Because obviously, something's messed up for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistory or sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series the following summer, claiming that he had "finished the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will play a part in Sam Shepherd's "True West" recovery, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife Rose is the best thing that has happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and set my life forward,” he said.
Rose plays Game, the girl in whom the character of Keith John Snow falls in love, in the fantasy series, the winner of the Emmy Award.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to the country's health services, more than 820,000 people were affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the communities of the KGBT is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of the disease are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied leaking data from Republican senators, blaming “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information to three U.S. senators by Republicans on the lawmakers' pages on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and more hideous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The run-off came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was linked to Waters’ office, and released information about a member of its team, Hill said.
“This groundless claim is completely untrue and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Flaisser.
“There is poison in this denial,” wrote Flaisher.
“This suggests that it does not have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
I don’t want to question the prosecutor’s motives.
It has to be calm and balanced.”
Flaisher compared Waters' reaction to criticism by the Democrats of Judge Cavano, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Essentially, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had consulted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be subject to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Review of "Johnny English Explodes Again" – The Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-contributing film and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and Inver.
Will self-pity and mimicry, which speak of how obvious it is that we are stupid, become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes wide open and a “gumish” face is allowed to re-create things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a large comic creation intended for movie fans who don’t speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for graceful brilliance, owns little of Cluzo, little of Mr. Bean, and much of the man who contributed a note on the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Opening Ceremony at Olpin's.
In addition, he was originally based on the lingering chaos behind him as a traveler and international man, whom Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten television commercials.
In the last film with Johnny English, there are two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, carrying it in a medieval armor, and for a short while the feathers swirled in his helmet.
Atkinson’s contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” film brands like “007” and “Mission Impossible” include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English's sniffing mishaps are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's lack of play reminds Mr. Bean.
It is always the current assumption that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked the British super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operatives to terrorize the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is shocked and helped the figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything she can for this quasi-Tereza-Mey role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English re-creates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which little is wasted the talent of Vicky Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and confront the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farce: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English provokes a real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for a virtual
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and loud, here there is a lot more content intended for children.
Quite a mediocre production.
As with the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that corresponds to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan, according to which the British work four a week, but get paid for five.
The party says it wants the heads of companies to provide the economies made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “save” the party’s economic program and plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for a policy review.
“It will not happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an effort that fits in with the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the party’s policy not being considered by it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from “unique directors” and “speculators” in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose "holdings" on the basis of the violations found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to put workers on board of companies and create privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private employee firms, which can accumulate annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk 60 minutes ago about whether the FBI’s investigation of Cavano could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could lead to some of the senators from the Republican subpoena given.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Peley, the 60-minute correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded compared to his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him, after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical, and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change that, an outrageous accusation is needed,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, addressing Christine Blassie Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizen” festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the big lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also get to know the true purpose of the event – the 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, non-emailing to a world leader, calling or otherwise connecting to help them get to know each other.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, who insist on a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the "Power of Nutrition", established in the UK by a partnership between investors and performers, committing to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with a "$35 million boost" in return for the country's "overrun", to avoid overruns.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note,” Tracy Ulman, the UK’s Food Power Ambassador, told the audience at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CHVs on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“A global citizen” replied: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But as with the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona are just some of the performers at this year’s New York event, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces to “block” and prevent energy exports – the Home Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zink said in a statement.
Zink says Russia’s involvement in Syria – specifically where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zink turned to those present at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with respect to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as a "one-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project “Northern Stream 2,” which Trump says turns Berlin into a “ hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline of Nord Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry’s leading organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look” at the 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously" look at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town council in Holiocke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
“It’s time for Washington to get women in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the nomination for president.”
Warren expressed his assessment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m getting closer to the bottom of my soul, just as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticisms of Trump and his candidacy for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed regarding a potential nomination in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Trak Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday evening.
“What my own son is going through after he returns is familiar to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going through,” she told a rally audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, cornered, come back and wonder if they will get the respect that they and their brothers and sisters have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of unconsciousness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vassila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new policy in the area of asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a petition of goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case was not disclosed, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of his gang’s brutal members” have abused her, but U.S. officials have rejected the request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum-seekers come, as nations facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum on documents fleeing domestic violence.
Colombian District Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the Goodwill report said.
In addition, the lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stressing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang-rape violence, according to the Associated Press.
"Refugee is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said in a July 11 statement.
The refuge has never intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death tolls double during search for survivors <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The situation for the survivors is getting more and more difficult.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded things.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who has suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, have been stationed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated in the open due to continuing secondary comorbidities.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with the family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. envoy accuses China of "torm" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page ad in the U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections, noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which import tariffs between countries are leveled.
According to experts from the U.S. and China at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this hurdle by releasing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by releasing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, on the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you’ll find limited speeches and you won’t see a real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s worrying economic trajectory, which is being controlled by the Chinese government.
He added that “one of the best-known Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans reject women’s voters for the midterm elections, analysts warn
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavano over several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, more specifically from women, during the upcoming months.
The emotions around the ceiling are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be returned," Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he had doubts whether the last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it either tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judiciary decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Fryder.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” said Steve Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say that the problem is already serious; that’s true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against those nominated for the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that she could follow a backlash if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh has been put on the bench. It’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Gai Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, a group that helps.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavano's testimony, with a little more branching to the latter.
A new sociological survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents either definitely or likely believe Ford’s statements, and 35 percent say they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that according to them Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Fleik’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavano had attacked her in a state of unconsciousness when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitalia in front of her while they were at a party during her follow-up to Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burners-Lee, has launched a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Burners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, it is joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said in regards to the initiative.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time are all at the same time.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “giving up the power of personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers, signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change or not when all their business models are fully updated for one night.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence on the net neutrality debate.
Although it launched Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of a priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in hostilities during the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not realizing that he had been honored with Britain’s highest military honors.
A memorial was opened on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's work was awarded a medal.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under heavy artillery and artillery shells."
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible courage" led the building forward, before attacking an artillery firearm with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel calm.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van set a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to take part in the parade" and added "the goodness of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of the Bellator 206 and finally you can’t witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 doubles, including six from the main card and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK via Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after building up to the early hours, especially because of the duel.
Fan described on Twitter the switch to the children’s animated film as “some kind of sick joke.”
“The government regulates that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was changed with a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig", yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said he would work on planning meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and there’s no way we can plan things so that the event will be held here on Sunday, and there – on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we did too much.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Lower' Because of His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he’s grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman claimed that until he started high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Laurent Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been in hospital for several months.
During his first program, Laverne Daley said he felt “less” than everyone else as he grew up, as “it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t let anyone down when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences and wants to inspire “hope” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised.”
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he said for the first time at the 14th Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find someone at your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
They both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says his “whole worldview” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I’m only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – as he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be next to me, Dad, or in the first place,’” he said.
“I held his hand while he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew I’d been dreaming all my life about it – jumping to the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more scary feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Smol – that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him tremble.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
The Lost Form of Michaelson Remains on the Board for “Raider Cup” on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn’t want his record to be tied to failure.
Michaelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furick for "fourball" and "foursom" games on Saturday.
Instead of being the main figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time grand tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his punches from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who has never been at the top of his career, is not in optimal shape for Le Golf National’s difficult pitch, where the long uneven field usually punishes every wrong hit.
And if the game itself is not worrying enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michaelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with rookie Tommy Flitwood and is aiming to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are left with four points before the 12th singles game, make a strong start, it can turn out that Michaelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammates, although he could hardly say anything much different.
“He fully understood his role today, he patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it turned out and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at the golf course and play, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo’s record for most games in the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This may put an end to his career in "Raider Cup", which has never come close to his impressive individual accomplishments.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal games, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people, and he’s a great guy for every team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great front could soon be melted.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big lead, accumulated before the singles matches from the last day of the Ryder Cup, can be easily eliminated.
The Dutchman made his Valderrama debut in 1997, when the team with captain Seve Balisteros led five points ahead of the Americans, but it was in the final right that he was almost caught and barely managed to hold the win by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but it was very difficult,” said Bjorn, “after the 2018 European team won 5–3.
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you need to do.
Nothing is done until you see the final result of the tablet.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve said all along that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, in the foreground, individual performances will come out, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out on your own, then you put your entire capacity to the test as a golfer.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner’s back, as he too has to give up until the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furick will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great backs on the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of the Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Craneshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on their last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under enormous tension.
That’s why we’ve formed our own composition and distributed our boys as we want to try and make the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and Ian Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
“I chose these players in this lineup because I think it gives us the greatest chances of success,” Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany has once again postponed the launch of a new warship.
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the obsolete warships from the Cold War period, but this will not be done until at least the following year due to the faulty systems and head-on growing copper expenditures.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s flagship new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The shipping court was due to join the navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the fleet in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have powerful weapons, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the docks.
However, the continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate force beyond the ocean – will be old when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The crash-landing F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of substantial "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including for crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet was actually “exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said the problem had become bigger over time, as the old ships were taken out of service, but no new ones were provided.
He complained that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Tracks the Secret Life of the Blind
A new study, conducted in a mansion in the Scottish mountains, aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in the management of future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the commonly encountered butterflies, as well as the brown arrowhead water bedbugs at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the mansion to track the activities of the blinds during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with the help of handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the stickers, as well as what types they emit.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Deweyar, NTS’ Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by every species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on the management of the habitat, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for butterflies and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of their homes.
Population risk may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft, and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, the blind are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use advanced eco-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the adhesives very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of shelters, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threave estate in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
“Here, at Threadave, we have a great field for the bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of mature trees and a perfect place to live.
But there’s still a lot more to do with the blinds that aren’t known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible to unintentionally destroy a single refuge to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy an entire local bat.
Sticks are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, harass or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Trust for the Protection of the Blind, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of our animal species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue a German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that after that he paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram video, referring to his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were posted, 33-year-old Ronaldo hailed the post as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball wearer told the camera.
“They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” he smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the claims they call an “unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where he is alleged to have raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County County Courthouse in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply succumbed to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she felt "terrified by revenge" and worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma from the incident.
At the time of the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain ‘sorry forever’ that it has lost the car manufacturers
The UK “is forever sorry” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the delay on the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
At the plant in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, say they will close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “just-in-time” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border problems, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the factory in Darbyshire, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May’s “scheduled” plan for a future relationship with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need to have a deal, we want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio's 4's Today programme.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we need to be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota can’t say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term it warns that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, I think that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have laid out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, continued to fight, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein observes the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, or not will threaten Mueller’s independence, has been fuelling rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal committee, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is still no date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed to the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference on Sept. 10.
Chris Wallace, head of the show, asked why.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not because of dislike for the “demonstrating behavior” of television journalists, although he shared: “I can’t say I don’t agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior.”
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you have witnessed it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers at the National Health Service of Scotland regarding the fears related to Brexit.
The Minister of Health has addressed in writing to EU staff working at the National Health Service of Scotland to express the gratitude of the state and the desire for them to remain in their places after Brexit.
Jane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contributions of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and this is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after getting a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered an emergency operation after getting a head injury during a meeting on Saturday when his team lost to Wanderbilt Commodores at 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time, according to the report.
“He went to the sideline and kind of just fell there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted Abergrombie’s oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on a stretcher and taken to the dressing room for further review.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/seriousness of the injury yet,” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a college scholarship runner, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on the purchase of real estate in the UK.

The state treasury expects an increase of over <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which will help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional income going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current coat of arms tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of surrender – can amount to up to three percent.
The state treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside of the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to get involved in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by plundering land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing to fix the UK’s “hospital shame.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control over rents and the end of the "no faulty" expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils greater power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to rebuilding the British dream – to make every new generation’s life better.
And that means we're fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy their homes as easily as the hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the pain of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’s team”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said the "biggest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving a club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in the First League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish High League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that was it,” Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games of Hampdon, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
“This opportunity, however, would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alwardes, Martin O'Neill, Roy Cain, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik’s former mentor said he was not worried about being the heir to such established names at such a famous club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measured by a positive answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because by structure, base and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It's not going to be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a falling team to a winner in the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was really on the cross,” he recalls of the time he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best place for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, made good money and had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat has increased the revenues of struggling British pubs, but it has amassed more tension for chain restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA’s business consultancy, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunny weather and longer lasting than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July, a similar pattern followed as in June, when the tubers scored 2.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth, compared to the declining movement of restaurants.
Food bugs have also been affected by the sun’s weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped by 6.6 percent per month, while in food there was a 3 percent decrease.”
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the off-home services sector.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent per year can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for the managers of the food establishments and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest.”
The overall growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollout.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK sales analyst for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hide a secret profile from their parents on social media
One in five children – some only 11 – have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study found.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages.
News has raised fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” profile that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some one in 11 – create a social network account that keeps it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised fears that material with sexual content would be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean “basic” profile that they show to their parents, and at the same time have secret profiles.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website discovered a teenage child that encouraged others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s amazing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elyde Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the Light Athletics Board in Scotland
Eileen Doyle was elected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished light-athlete, and President Ian Beatty has defined this move as a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her rich experience at an international level over the past decade.
“Elyde enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting her,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals in total, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, has lost the ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I got hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, shares online opinions
A company that manufactures breast pumps, shares online opinions with advertising that compares breastfed mothers with cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of the expected "world's first noiseless breast pump suitable for carrying", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump delivers to the skin.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's rib, full of hay, against a background of a song with a text that says, "Yes, I suck, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a joke, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, pump, nurse your friends.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the audience, with many claiming it was demeaning to the “terribles” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth,” one wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is collected discreetly in a baby carrier (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them for advertising a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “Such inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that she considered the song “extremely fun.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little short, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who sneeze (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘sheep’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the clip, the women’s group revealed that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their sutures.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and collects discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are weaned.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “Pompa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
By drawing a parallel between dairy cows and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the milking of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Marta Jakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings on the border remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s sharp rhetoric and policy made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear that they risk their stay in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, with these data being shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or are members of the guardian family reside illegally in the country, most of whom are foreign-criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albens said.
In an effort to deal with the registration of these children faster, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to reception staff and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing at large facilities, such as in Tornio, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving children to the “city of the tent” without giving them enough time to prepare for an emotional level or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “to which appropriate action will be taken.”
“They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” by both terrorist organizations and by “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish parts and the Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could be reversed, accusing "some Western countries of "breathing unwarranted fears" that encourage refugees to stand aside.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to these returns,” he said.
“They turn into a political question, something that is entirely a humanitarian question.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold in Idlib provided an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military actions would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra fronts, who “are still being destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and the opposition, to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
On this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless — as many liberals are likely to hope — his presidency will not be terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be “the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big-news evenings.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama The Last Candidate, where he talks about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Neal Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Squill told me that he replied, "Because he's making me laugh."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that shows up on television, a surge of Washington stories can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of "Strawskin" $5,000.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like part of a reality show is giving you a little bit of it every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a sitcom about changing roles.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had locked himself up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the television, especially when Brett Cavano had to stand before the Senate legal committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember once when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Flies told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments in the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives a stream of money, thanks to the rearrangement of the congressional districts and hence two titles for the same place.
The recently re-distributed district in the suburb of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titular, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is significantly opposed to the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaigns Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaigns Commission (NRCC).
Lamb was sacked in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated midterm elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, after which it withdrew.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions no longer to recognize Taiwan," said earlier this month H. Nauert, a spokesman for the Department.
But sanctions were only expected against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid to fight drugs, with the aim of development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be punishable by the Central American state with its unemployment rate and percentage of killings.
With the progress of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves as a continuation of such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in the effort to make progress.
But by mid-September, senior management authorities had clarified that their desire was for the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will be attending the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to be taken into account before this body, just as he prepares to stand before the voters, as well as perhaps also before judicial sittings composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here and I do not imagine that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had burdened him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such noble moments, and the tireless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing a number of similar charges at the moment.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he had offered to covertly write down the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections to Congress if that will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table carrying swastikas.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow half-back Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before a 2–2 tie with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a stepping stone to bigger achievements.
“We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game with the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems like a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do everything on our own and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened past my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys are really having fun, the trainings are useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert all our efforts to forget last season and achieve the desired success.”
Women Are Worried About Fears About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what concerns they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these solutions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions, when choosing a long-term care financial institution, can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the very beginning.
Hire a health care assistant so that you have a specific confidant who supervises your medical care and ensures that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also consider the idea of a Financial Affairs Commissioner.
You can choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s about who the doctors will be,” Martin said.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organizations cannot receive information from the Dongala regency, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which administrative region, smaller than the province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The production of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from Indonesia's Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in the Dongal.
Tsunami peaked in the western part of the Dongala and in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful storm on December 26 on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the Pacific Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude trench fractures Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that broke out on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunamis were activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy tremors swept the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, home violence alert interference, and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the Alaskan state police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he announced he was "innocent, for sure" when asked for a plea, the media reported.
Paylin is threatened with a fine for three Class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of his freedom for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his Iraq service.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Died
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that devastated Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications network has been disrupted, with the number of deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a truck to rent a Home Depot to carry out the October attack on a bicycle lane near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, gasping pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the death penalty request, filed in court.
According to the court document, both charges can end with a death sentence.
Seven weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary sent a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of racket-related murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of rape and murder.
The attack called for “serious planning and deliberateness,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was executed as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
“Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lory Decad, Darren Drake, Arielle Erley, Ernan Felluci and Alejandro Damyan Panuco,” he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time New York’s Southern District sought a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Second World War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no sense of remorse in the days and months after the assassination, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIL videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked his hospital room to set the flag of ISIS, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which consists of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of taking a guilty and life sentence without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to seek a death sentence.
A member of the Conservatives’ parliament says Najjal Faraz should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today, during a protest at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” – as one of the members of Theresa May’s own party suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain "had come out so far" if Mr Farage was secretary on Brexit issues.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to reconcile with the deeply divided ranks of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his "Chequers" compromise plan, despite the attacks by Brexit supporters, EU supporters and others.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels in spite of hostile reactions and insist Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bon told the protesters with the slogan “Exit means going out” in Solihull that he wanted to “throw out the Chequers”.
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have been involved equally with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were a leader, we would have left by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.
Noting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be a slave.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bon denied the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The perception that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please cut "Chequers" and start listening to each other.
In an open letter to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should “feel pressure” if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit and we’ve come together here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
“We mobilize the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a hike through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists raised flags with slogans “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis stood up with the Conservatives about the party's security problems when he opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all of Canada's IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, and more, for the unhindered crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren said he would "seriously consider" his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” following the November election.
Boston Globe said a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a town council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against U.S. Rep. Jeff Dill, who was joint chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take over Trump’s post in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor’s building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is high time “women go to Washington and fix our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested for Sims' death from LSU
Police in Batton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Button Rouge's police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who can be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested unproblematically and detained in the arrest of the police department of the Eastern Batton Rouge municipality.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youth who grew up in Batton Rouge – Sims took part in 32 games with 10 appearances as a titleholder last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 games per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's guidance helped him beat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas advanced ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s guidance will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the exit from the race.
Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next round and went out after Fettle, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a manoeuvring and driving a "gum-to-gum", which forced Ferrari's pilot with an unwillingness to free the inner part of the track, after a time to escape.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
After that he even led for quite a long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimi Raikonen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally entered pit-stop in the 44th round, but failed to catch enough in the next eight rounds and eventually Raikonen finished fourth.
It was a hard day, as Valteri did a great job all weekend and he showed up as a real gentleman when he let me out of it.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It really was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump took a rally with Senator Diane Finchtain on Saturday over her claim that she had not distributed the letter by Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses the applicant for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual harassment.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate legal committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting, and dishonest.”
“What can happen and the good that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread by you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... No, we didn’t spread,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter with details of Ford's claims against Kavanaugh as early as July, and it was circulated earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the spread had occurred from her office.
“I haven’t covered up Ford’s claims, I haven’t spread her story,” Finstein told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the confidentiality and I kept the confidentiality as she wished."
But the denial on her part was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the applicant for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that the Democrats are using the claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
Look at the disrespect, the shame, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to overcome in order to regain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwayne scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundy Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 win over Dundy on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals after beating Patrick Duaire and Francis Bovilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauny leveled for the hosts before Dwayre restored the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalised for Dundy before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals confirmed their victory.
This is the third win in the Elite League for Adam Kief's boys, who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between the opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The blow with which Dwayre found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Ruderford doubled the lead by assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to level out with the help of Kauny at 15:16.
Dwayne managed to get the Giants to lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Kauny and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nilsen give Dundy a lead for the first time in the second half, giving him everything he could and cementing the team's fifth goal win in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games of a total of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight manager has been killed to make sure hundreds of people on board a plane can escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
The strong secondary cowards continued to defeat the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands after the country’s disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot reach it," Sutopo Purvo Nurhoho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
Waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There are marauders everywhere in the minimarkets.”
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was devastated by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is unknown after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been declared missing after it earlier said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said it could not contact a male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
“That’s very nice,” says Janes.
Janes says that he and the others managed to cross the deep to the cross water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He shared that the stewardesses had panicked and screamed, as well as that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that seamen repairing the harbor nearby also assisted in the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat to escort people to the shore before the plane sank into the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in flights with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyzer exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended its statement on the case this Saturday in a repeat trial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett from the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone footage to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telesis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said she knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Records from mobile phones indicate that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that shortly after Chambers Telis’ death, he deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke negative opinions about the genre by performing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has deviated from its origin of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate the conscious hip-hop.
Performers of the Fugees and Common type are reborn in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York woman sues couple after firing for 'racist' message
A New York-based nanny is suing the couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complains that she is “another black woman.”
The couple refused to be racist, pretending they wanted to be “forcible.”
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was laughed when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "unpleasant" Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, Post York reported.
Mrs. Morris received a paycheck for a day's work and then sent home by taxi.
Morris now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal, seeking the sum of $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, although she did not have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that ending Morris' employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you insulted, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it.”
Referring to a request for “encouraging,” Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to attack anyone in this situation?
This is not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the court case is still under review, public opinion quickly condemns the couple on social media, depriving them of their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, tells of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She shared that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book for a little toy bear, would feel optimistic about the eventual rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he wasn’t self-indulgent,” she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought vainly to save her life.
“He was constantly calling to say that the situation is really bad, that he does not expect to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“After that, Nad called me to say that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be coming to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to keep her heart, slowly stop acting and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before that and so it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get close."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far been mourning the loss of her daughter, gets on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the ordeal she is going through.
“No one understands,” she says.
“I had my head down and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-encompassing sense of intimacy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him.”
Worrying Women Put Cards to Prevent Suicides From Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are putting on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “so that people know who to go to and who to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t share that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She shared that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we need to move forward and fight.”

Brett Cavano's future is in question after the FBI begins an investigation
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation with limited duration and limited scope – maybe we could unite our efforts,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “disintegrate” despite the confirmed overspending.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unhappiness is due to the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are not well-prepared, they will seriously hurt their attempts to elect their representative to the state’s highest court.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee population 'decreased' by Kim
A South Korean lawmaker claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sung, citing data from the South Korean ministry of the association, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from phoenix.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and pass more easily than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, as it often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to jointly work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the U.S. of failing to make any progress since.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way to be unilaterally disappointed first,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "sterile" and said he was not fit for service in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano "sterile" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her ‘sterile’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claims that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when discussing his family and school years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the person” organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was presumptuous with regard to the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with these claims and the way the Clinton family and the Democrats are being persecuted,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in case Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it like this – if he doesn’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that in her capacity as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavano's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, presumptuous man to enter the court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it wonderful?’” Pelosi concluded.
Women also need to be in control.
This is a well-founded criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can’t accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got a huge help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her interlocutor, ‘Because I might be crying, you think.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, while I was bitten by an inexpressible rage, a woman older than me grabbed me by the door – a chilling leader, whom I’ve always been a little afraid of – and shrugged.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy that they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have another one appear.
Someone called the situation "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs."
As she gets involved late in the campaign, she lags behind in fundraising and decides she won’t stay in the race if she doesn’t manage to raise $2 million.
The battle was doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she is the hall of so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which is why it is so difficult to get money together and you can turn to the voters, not the voters, a
“One might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is still speeding up, a split between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning wave this year by taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions has emerged this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion in production (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) with an effective tax on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing returned new tariffs with five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate to any U.S. blow, and soon the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore it.
To make Washington give up means to submit to demands, but to bring down a head publicly in front of Washington would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that an accelerated political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than the observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, an expert on the issue, told the Associated Press.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in restoring the country devastated by the war, which lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists to bring them back to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance will not be accepted from countries that have financed the rebels.
Europe wins the "Raider Cup" in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a 16.5 out of 10.5 on the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a "Raider Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points, which ensured victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who represented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first strike on the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a 5-0-0 balance since the competition was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt has lost categorically by 5&4 to a player in the European team at the lowest place in the ranking – Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson has lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Pooler, for whom this is likely the last part of "Raider Cup".
Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Spanish veteran with eight appearances in the Ryder Cup, became the European with the most points in the tournament for all time, increasing his assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to be able to lift the cup again.
The most important thing is the team and I’m happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed over to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his total Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Odd statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator on which he conceded only to Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Fourick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressured the European team.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Committee on Rider Cup and look only forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overwhelmed.”
