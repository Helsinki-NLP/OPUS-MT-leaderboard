Members of the Welsh Association have expressed their concerns "because they will take them for a fool"
Several members of the parliament have expressed their regret after hearing the proposal to change the name of their office to MWP (the Welsh Legislature).
This idea was created after the plans were developed to change the name of the Welsh Legislature.
Members of a political party are worried about them because this plan is a good way to defeat them.
A member of the Labour Party at the federal level said: “This new name echoes with the words Twp and Pwp.”
If you're out of Wales: In Wales, the word twp means "good" and the word pwp means "good".
For his part, a member of the Scottish team said the whole team was "not very happy" and suggested looking for a replacement name.
In addition, a member of the Welsh Conservative Party has said that there is a need to change the name to new ideas, but has also expressed his concern about the risks that MWP may bring about changes.
In order to better understand this issue, it should be borne in mind that Welsh w letters and Yorkshire u letters have similar pronunciations.
On the other hand, the one-to-one commission, which is creating a legal loophole to make changes to the names, has said this: "As for the members of the other, they will have the sole responsibility to choose the descriptors they want to use."
According to the Welsh government's 2017 bid, the Welsh parliament has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the selection of proposed proposals and, in general, received a number of declarations of solidarity under the names of the Welsh Legislature.
Regarding the names of the members of the Union, the Commission chose the name of the Member of the Welsh Legislature or WMP, but the name of the MWP was decided on in a public consultation.
Members of the Union, on the other hand, suggest alternative options, but it can be extremely difficult to choose one word of mouth; especially for the President of the Union, Elin Jones, who rarely had to send a telegram with changes.
However, the legislation of the changes to be made will affect the functioning of the partnership; the other will create rules to prevent the activities of the parties that will cause the loss of the good name of the members of the Union, and the design of the partnership system will be managed with the help of that law.
When discussing changes in legislation, members of the Party will have the opportunity to make a decision on their names.
The Macedonian people will take part in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia" or not.
With Greece (which has a province called Macedonia) this referendum has been organized to be able to resolve the long-standing issue of the last decades.
The Athens government has long stressed that the name of the northern neighbor is a re-indication of its territory and has repeatedly interfered with the request to enter the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to changing the name of the plebiscite, said he would not see the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say that only the price to be paid to enter the U.S. and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Camps Lose Their Voices for Problems With Harlem Churches
“I’ve talked to several older people and they’ve long said that you could find a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Today, again, there is nothing.”
He says it's normal for the bar to disappear.
“People use other methods to socialize,” he explains.
“Bars are no longer used to bring people together in the neighborhood.”
With regard to the church, he is concerned that the money earned for the sale of the assets will not be enough and "we will be at the starting point again sooner or later".
In addition, churches may be replaced by houses, and properties filled with people who do not care about the neighborhood sanctuaries will be built.
“The people who will buy the homes of property will be white people,” he says, “and, therefore, the elites will shut themselves down in life because these new people are not members of the churches.”
The White People's Congregations built two churches before Harlem was a black metropolis; it was the Metropolitan Community of 1870 and was built a decade later in San Martin.
In 1930 he left the original Methodist Congregation.
After that, a black person’s congregation took the reins.
Reverend John Howard Johnson's black congregation took over the church of San Martin; Howard organized a boycott of the 125-street commercial store in Harlem, which did not hire or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church suffered several injuries, but Father Johnson's clergy designed several plans to rebuild the church and collect carillons.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and heir to San Martin, called the carillon "the camps of the poor."
In July, the expert who struck the carillon gave him another name: "the treasure of culture" and "the unrepresentative of historical instruments".
Tiffany Nge of the University of Michigan has also stated that a black musician played the first carillon around the world; the musician, Dionysius A. Linde, went on to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, San Martin has seen a number of arquitecteurs and contractors come and go, some of them brought in by contemporary leaders or episcopal dioceses.
The parish councils (the council of archdiocese made up of temporary leaders) also sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify the contracts of these persons "that the increased costs will be passed to the parish", because the parishes have nothing to do with the dioceses sent to the opposite arch.
Some clergymen have filed their grievances over the lack of respect for the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured when he is looking for an oyster in California’s ocean
According to police, on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded when he was looking for a oyster on the coast of California on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack occurred on Beacon Beach in Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel said on KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning, but his friends, screaming, heard him asking for help; then a group of people were swimming to help him out of the water.
Hammel thought he was crying with joy because he found a friend of his who was oysters, but then he realized that his friend was yelling, "They've kicked me!"
They've hit me!
"I could see the whole club," said Hammel, looking at his friend.
“I cried out to all the people to get out of the water, ‘There’s a plague!’” Hammel explained.
The boy is taken to the San Diego Rady Children's Hospital and his condition is serious.
It could not have been the species of raccoon that attacked the deer.
Captain Larry Giles, a member of Sorosle, presented a report to the media and said they had seen a mole a few weeks earlier, but the species was determined not to be dangerous.
Giles also said the victim's wounds were at the top of the dress.
Police have shut down access to the Swami beach in Encinitas from the Point of Casablanca to be able to conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure the safety of the public.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of raspberries in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans to enter the UK's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken possession of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers the most stylish beauty salons with a number of skilled and specialized workers.
While sales of fashion and home products are shrinking, <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion has been invested in the UK’s beauty sector, which is growing without limits; greater beauty chains will be built and will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Thanks to the investments made in the field of beauty, the shops that sold televisions, microwaves and home products can take advantage of supermarkets.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty products offer will double and offer more than 3000 products; in addition, Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands will be placed in the hands of customers.
With regard to the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, there will be more space in the marked areas, such as areas that can be found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket again presents its "Boutique" brand of make-up, which is a completely beige product; younger buyers are asking for more and more of these products.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop will test the women offered at two stores in Sainsbury's supermarkets; the first opened in Croydon (south London) last week and the second, Selly Oaken (Birmingham), will open at the end of the year.
Online shopping and daily shopping at small local stores are the reasons why supermarkets need to work head and ears to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s supermarkets, said that sales points will take on the style of large jumps and that supermarket chains will reduce the threat from Aldi and Lidl competitors to offer more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats, two chains two years ago after the purchase; that is to say, food sales have been tightened and the chains purchased are more troublesome than ever.
The supermarket tried to reopen the beauty and drug stores, but the strategy failed.
He then teamed up with Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but that association ended because the process of sharing profits in supermarket drug stores was turned into paper fire.
A new strategy was developed when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for a whopping <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds chain will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a large luxury brand to the four stores; the others, La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said: "We've improved the appearance of beauty salons and found our customers to have better environments.
In addition, we have hired highly experienced workers for the products they are given with specific advice.
We have designed our brand to meet all requirements and, thanks to the convenience of our surroundings and locations, our beauty salons offer a modern and easy option in front of the shop that uses outdated methods.”
Peter Jones has been "crazed" after Holly Willoughby dropped $11 million offer.
The show's star, Peter Jones, has been "disgusted" by Hollywood television presenters Willoughby because I want to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV companies after dropping the 11 million-free offer there related to the brand's forever business.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand that sells home products and components.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The presenters of this morning’s program, 37, used Instagram to present their resignation.
Following the resignation of Holly Willoughby, Marks & Spencer and ITV to accept contracts offered by companies such as Dragons" The show's star Peter Jones became extremely angry at leaving the high-profit business created between the two at the last minute.
According to our sources, a meeting was held on Tuesday at Marlowe's headquarters, and as a result, Jones was "extremely angry" when he heard the explanation of the most famous woman on our television: that he could not accept a new contract of 1.5 million livres and that he would not be able to accept it if he did so.
The deal has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's 11 million livres.
Willoughby, 37, said on Instagram that he had left the Truly brand business to leave the UK to go to a holiday home.
A source said: "Holly's priorities have always been among those options.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, even when the offer of the brand was closed.
What’s more, the warehouse of Marlowe’s headquarters is filled with products that need to be sold.”
According to Aditi, the company is lucky enough to lose millions of pounds due to the departure of the presenter of the This Morning program (all of which are the most profitable presentations in the UK); the company has invested a lot of money in a variety of products (others, pillows, candles, clothes and household items) and is now producing them.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappek truly created the brand in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as director in March.
The two couples always organize their holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter for I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source on Jones's team said he would not say anything about the activities of his business.
It was a tough conversation, yes, but then we fell in love.
She was joking about the bad news she had to endure because of the media, all because of a "disgusting" comment about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump done so many things?
Trump has used his "television presenter" voice to respond to tweets:
“I didn’t give anything.”
After the first meeting held in Singapore in June, Kim said he wanted to hold a second meeting, and thanks to that, a huge step has been taken on the path of North Korea's nuclear defense.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has stopped.
After a meeting in Singapore in June and three months later, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the UN’s world leaders this: In the general assembly held on Saturday, North Korea has not seen a “appropriate response” to the United States’ military on both sides.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have been tightened to keep the country under pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a better view and he says so in his last speech.
“Our relationship with North Korea is better than ever,” he said.
"In addition, we declared war on North Korea."
Millions of people could be killed in this war.
But now we have this special relationship between the hands.”
Moreover, he said that the efforts made to improve relations with Kim have brought good results; the other, the tests with missiles have been completed, the processes for the liberation of certain people have improved, and the withdrawal of military forces from the rest of the United States is on the way.
In addition, he explains his unusual point of view, in relation to the interviews he had with Kim.
"The president's job is incredibly simple, but when we need to have 10,000 friends who want to get into the country with strength, we have 200 people here," Trump said in a statement.
Indonesia’s tsunamis and earthquakes have destroyed an island and killed hundreds.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was not necessary to help non-profit organizations to win the international championship.
Although 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (it is a prerequisite for requesting assistance from nations).
"In a number of ways, the government has said clearly and clearly that it does not need international assistance, so this is a challenge," Ms. Sumbang said.
The Save the Children organization is forming a group that will go to Palura, but still does not know that volunteers can work in the country.
Mr Sutopo, the representative of the Indonesian national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are working in Palun to be able to accept assistance from international agencies.
Despite the fact that Indonesia has suffered a number of earthquakes, the countries have undervalued measures to cope with the affluence of nature.
Anti-Tsunami strongholds have been built in Acehen, but there are still few strongholds on the coast.
Paluk has no siren to warn people, and even though he was on the alert, perhaps that's why he'd be so dead.
When the weather is good, travelling between the islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Moreover, natural disasters are making it difficult for them to implement their logistics.
A hospital boat to treat the victims of the earthquake was surrounded by Lombok and now goes to Palura; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
The campaign of the president of the game Widodo was based on projects to improve the infrastructure of Indonesia and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, the funds have been reduced and the administration of the President of the Game is under pressure as the next year's elections are being prepared.
In addition, the Game Lords have trouble controlling the ranks of Indonesian sects; for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of their homes have been lost because they have taken Christian and Islamic gangs to the streets; others use mortars, bows, geese and similar weapons.

Thanks to a goal scored by London's Stamford Bridge Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute on Saturday, Liverpool lost the Premier League to Chelsea.
Thanks to Xherdan Shaqirik's 30-yard walk out of Chealse, Sturridge had the opportunity to change the 1-0 mark.
Before the ball reached the top of the door, he placed it on his left.
Thanks to this glare, the ball flew to the area and to the upper-left of the net.
In the end, the ball crossed the Kepa Riszabalaga defensive line and entered the net.
"Since players like Shaq are always playing in the top, I wanted to get that position so I could get the ball, so I tried to get as long as I needed," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that there was a song coming and, with one touch, I was in the ball's shoes; after that I didn't have much time to think about it: I just took a chance."
Belgian star Eden Hazard, after scoring a goal in the 25th minute, was winning Chelsea 1-0 in the middle of the match.
In that game, the frontman of the blue team returned an orphan pass, Mateo Kovacici, who turned in the middle of the field and ran to Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> was in the middle of the field.
Then he gave the ball to the ball, which was on the foot of Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defense of the other team and entered the ball into the top net of the door with a shield made with his left foot that destroyed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's defense.
Liverpool's next match will be against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Tuesday in London.
Indonesia's death toll rises to 832 as a result of the tsunami
Indonesia's quakes and tsunamis have soared to 832, according to the disaster agency.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the press, said on Friday that after sustained waves of 7.5 magnitude earthquake and a height of 20 feet, several people were caught between the rubble of the buildings.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was full of buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for raping and killing a woman
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found injured at 7.55 a.m. on John Grayson Mews Street; a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the main suspect in the murder.
The police asked the neighboring people if they saw or heard anything, to call the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "It's just the beginning of the investigation, but if someone saw or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd love to get in touch with us.
We also want to ask for help from drivers of cars that can make recordings, other taxi drivers, as it may be necessary to record information for research."
On the other hand, a police representative confirmed that the woman who was found was living in Birkenhead and found her body inside a house.
That afternoon, several friends who knew the woman came to the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
As the investigation progresses, the police will contact the victim’s family.
Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but police said no one could get in or out of the building.
After hearing what happened, he was shocked.
Neighbors will have to wait a few hours to get into their homes.
A police officer was talking to a neighbor and was saying that the whole area would be taken as the scene of the murder.
Later, a woman appeared at the scene crying.
He said over and over again, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police patrol cars entered the police station and another patrol was left outside.
Several police officers searched the building's apartments.
Anyone with information can send a message to the DM <0x40>MerPolCC account, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers' phone number (0800 555 111); it must only mention the September 30, 247th registration.
The state of Cromwell in Parliament has become the ultimate goal of the “re-history” movement
If it goes away, it will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed several religious objects, the Puritan fanatics in England did the same thing with several historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, argues that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "headlessness" and that he is "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's discussion of the removal of the states outside the Palace of Westminster has become an objective.
Cromwell himself never asked for or organized the iconoclasms of the Civil War in England.
Maybe we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the actions his ancestors, Thomas, had done in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is part of the 19th-century views and our historiography; many still believe that the person's actions should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "In the 19th century, few people believe this, yes, but still many people believe that Cromwell was a defender of the Parliament against foreign pressure; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
The historical debate will continue to be the mummy of the person whether or not that person’s exact picture is accurate.
However, we can safely say that the conflict that took place in the mid-17th century was the starting point of our country's development, and Cromwell was part of the parties that took part in that famous starting point.
The title "Lord Protector" may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements won."
A Chinese farmer is killed by a Chinese farmer.
A Chinese man has attacked and killed a farmer in a southwestern market in China, according to local media.
A man named "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a severed artery and was in the blood in a piggy bank in the Liupanshu market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to harvest pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He usually travels from Yunnan province on Wednesdays with his cousin to sell 15 cigars on the market.
The next morning, his superior found the body of the dead man and saw that the door of the nearby pig was open.
He also stated that there was a large amount of blood in his mouth.
The court’s analysis reports confirm that the pig has been killed by a farmer for 550 pounds.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and swollen," the cousin told the Guiyang Evening News newspaper, whose name was "Wu."
According to security camera footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Thursday) to feed the pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not one of the ancestors of Yuan or his predecessor.
A market chief told the Evening News newspaper that the pig is locked up to avoid further attacks and to let the police collect evidence of the place.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Despite being odd, some of the pigs’ attacks have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in a Massachusetts compound, and the man sustained serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor, until the man's wife dumped the animal.
In 2012, a Oregon farmer’s pig ate his body and, after that, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig is not a side animal, but if it detects blood, it can act as a “resistance”.
“They love to play.
They're like kids, and they're very knowledgeable... and they don't want to hurt you.
“You just have to show respect,” he said.
The small storms of Rosa hurricane will leave the storms in the southwest of the United States.
According to the weather, Rosa is weakening as she travels to the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring storm surges in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosas will generate 85 million hours of wind, and will become a Category 1 hurricane. According to the Eastern Time, on Sunday, it was found to be 385 million miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that they will be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure point is being created in the Pacific Ocean and will go east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja will go to the California Peninsula, which will turn into a tropical storm and take tropical rain to the north-east of the United States.
In addition, on Monday, Rosak will bring 10 ounces of rain to some places in Mexico.
It will then be combined with a low-pressure point of tropical humidity and large storm surges will occur in the south-west in the coming days.
In local areas, 1-4 times the risk of water flooding, landslides and landslides may occur in the desert as a result of sudden floods, landslides and landslides.
Rainstorms caused by large tropical showers can leave 2-3 percent water at specific times and places, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 inches of water in the south-west, especially in Arizona.
Because tropical rain is on the sides, sudden floods and landslides can create conditions.
It is not recommended to go for a walk in the wilderness if the warning of a tropical storm is given.
Raindrops can be turned into torrential rain, and floods can bring gusts of wind and dust.
Also, as the pressure drops, there will be local storm surges on the southern coast of California.
Because it is raining and a half-inch of water can be collected, and it is possible to create small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first year of the rainy season.
There may also be some tropical storms in Arizona on Sundays and Mondays, but there will be more storm surges on Mondays and Tuesdays.
On Tuesday, rain showers will go to the Four Winds and will last until Wednesday.
Urals may have severe temperature changes in the United States, to the extent that Arctic soils are cooled, but tropical temperatures will remain mild.
Sometimes these temperatures have a big change in the range of the clouds.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes on Sunday in the middle of the United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the sun will rise and it will spread to all places.
The central and eastern parts of the United States will be low; temperatures will be 80 degrees from the south-east to the north-east.
Also, it can be 80 degrees on a Tuesday in New York; they will be slightly more than 10 degrees above the other temperature.
According to long-term weather forecasts, the east of the United States is expected to experience temperatures higher than average during the first fifteen years of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s statement.
More than 20 million people saw the shocking statements of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the Supreme Court's candidate, in the news on Tuesday's sixth channel, which Kavanaugh blamed for the sexual abuse suffered in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued, and channel presenters stopped Friday's perpetual programming to give a last-minute news: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed to be able to do a week-long investigation with the FBI.
According to the Senate magistrate of Ford, it is entirely certain that Kavanaugh touched her once and again while she was drunk and tried to get rid of her clothes at a school party.
On Kavanaugh's behalf, he said in a furious statement that he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen’s data, about 20.4 million people watched the declaration on Friday.
The company has calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with the number of people who watch TV in the office.
To be an example, we can say the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or Academy awards.
As for the Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is completely accepted by the channel's presenters and, on the other hand, by the time it was making the statement that it had 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS grossed 3.1 million, NBC grossed 2.94 million, MSNBC grossed 2.89 million, and CNN grossed 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Upon hearing the statement, the public's interest remained.
Flake was the pinnacle of Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican party's office announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS channels shot Kavanaugh on Friday while trying to take a protest-like elevator surrounded by protesters to declare in the Magistrate's Chamber.
He saw directly on CNN that he had looked down while the protesters were snoring.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?”
And he added: "You have amazing abilities, but a lot of women don't have anything."
Before closing the elevator door at that moment, Flake said that he had published a statement from his office and that he would give more details in his vision.
Cable and television channels were immediately screaming at the sight and, in the meantime, the Magistrate was voting on the nomination to be Senator Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said he would vote for the FBI to review the arguments against the candidate for a week and then, bear in mind that he was asking the least democratic parties to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake almost believed in the research.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flaken's decision was a powerful one, because the Republican party did not have the time to vote for Kavanaugh without conducting a poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the basis of Brexit
According to an interview conducted in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the country.
On 29 September 2018, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May delivered a speech to the Conservative Party, which will take place in Birmingham.
The first page of the paper appeared in another interview, with former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticizing the plan called the "women's game" for Brexit, and he knew that the UK and the European Union were "very ridiculous" to pay for.
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson for Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
The police shared a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpsons, and according to police, Sims lost his eyelashes in the fight.
According to CBS's WAFB, police recovered those windows from the scene of the murder and said Simpson's DNA was in them.
After Simpson asked him, he confessed that Wayder had been shot.
His lawyer said he had pledged $350,000 to the company.
A preliminary report was published by the East Baton Rouge District Court Office on Friday, where the cause of death is said to be a shot from head to toe.
The Department of Homeland Security is trying to find Louisiana State Police fugitives, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the surrounding townspeople to help them find suspects in the investigation.
LSU Sports Manager Joe Alleva thanked the police for their “presence and for the protection of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-meter player Baton Rouge grew up and his father Wayne, LSU, also played basketball.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayden's death.
"These are the things that always bother you," Wade said.
A man throws a train in Mexico City.
Popocatepetl mines have reached the southern neighbors of Mexico City.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters warned the Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that the crater be removed after several activities had been undertaken; 183 gas and iron spills were recorded for 24 hours.
The middle of the slum also had a lot of slums.
According to the social network images, the rail tunnels can be seen in the winds of some of Mexico City's neighborhoods (e.g. Xochimilcon) cars.
Geophysicists have estimated that the activity of the quake from the southeast of the capital to 45 miles (72 kilometers) has increased since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
"Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The year before the vote on the independence struggle between the police and the independents of Catalonia
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday to commemorate the first year of the Catalan independence vote, when thousands of people joined forces in the fight against the riot police in Barcelona to commemorate the first year of the Catalan independence vote.
The anti-style police stopped a group of rioters, but the eggs and paint were thrown away; as a result, dust mites were created in the streets filled with tourists.
More fighting ensued later because the police were using their fighting to stop the fighting.
In addition, the independence groups spent several hours singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the Unionists, who were singing "Long Life for Spain".
According to local journalists, about a dozen people were treated for the minor injuries received in the skirmishes.
There is a great deal of tension in this territory that wants to find independence after the elections on October 1, which were illegal according to the government of Madrid, but achieved a day to celebrate the independence of Catalonia.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but the participation of the people was very small because of the number of people who wanted to boycott the elections against independence.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 people were injured in the attack by the police, because voting boats for the elections were used to stop the voters, which is why forced suffrage was created.
On Friday, independence groups were camped out to avoid a demonstration on behalf of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the independence demonstration with his wife, and said that Catalonia no longer has any hope of gaining independence.
“We had a wonderful time.
“My parents could have been crying for joy, but we’re stuck now,” he said.
After a decisive but important victory in the local elections of the last December, the Catalan sides have had many problems in maintaining the interest of the people this year; some leaders of the parties have been expelled or arrested for holding a referendum and are seeking independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording a police demonstration on her phone and a politician from both sides says she is guilty of the situation.
“There’s more tension and tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been awaiting trial since last year, said he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, the best way would be to reduce democratic values and condemn the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men arrested for shooting at a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for repeatedly driving a Londonderry house.
The event was held in Ballynagard Crescent, at 19:30 (BST) on Tuesday afternoon.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors had been damaged.
It also appears that they have used a car accident.
Livingston wins 1-0 in front of Rangers thanks to Menga's pitcher
Dolly Mengar's first goal for Livingston
Livingston has upset Rangers and Steven Gerrard wins his second defeat in 18 games as head of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengar's shooting was decisive for Gary Holten's Hibernia team in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated during this Premiership season and will have to play against the Hearts leader (who has eight more points) next Sunday.
Before that match, the Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna on Tuesday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston's team is undefeated and there are six games left in this season; Holt's coach doesn't know the failure since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses a lot of opportunities in front of strong visitors
The wood team had to face the goal before it entered; because of its tremendous accuracy, it caused a number of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgow moved his efforts out after Craig Halketten's head.
The waiters were satisfied with the Rangers' leave, but they knew that the visitors could be happy at any time.
And with that change came the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave a free throw and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined to mark Menga, but the latter scored a goal after hitting the ball in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were able to take control of the property, but the home defense was impenetrable and Liam Kelly passed the game without any problems.
This pattern continued into the middle of the second part, but Alfredo Morelos's casting required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not score a goal for Rangers' Allan McGregor and avoided Lithgowek Livingston's other play.
The passes were repeated over and over again in the Livingston area, and the home players were eliminated over and over again; two penalties were applied for by Halckett for defying Glenn Middleton's representative and touching the other ball with his hand, but the two were dismissed.
Livingston's "extreme" match - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena in Scotland
Livingston's game was uneventful and the result was inconceivable.
For me, they’ve made some special games and they have great opportunities to climb the ladder.
The style of the players and the team has hardly changed since they first arrived, but Holt has been a special coach: since you arrived he has put the team on the right track.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's work has been terrible; he has organized and managed an unprecedented defense, and Menga is responsible for putting Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers didn’t have much inspiration.
They work very well when they are on Gerrard's orders, but the standards set by the trainers have been forgotten.
The last game was a poor one and they only won the home defense once; the Rangers must walk fast if they want to get out of the middle of the table.
Erdogan finds welcome to the contrary in the colony
The smiles and blue skies were on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
President Erdogan is the last day of a controversial visit to Germany; the visit was organized to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed some of the issues; others, the human rights and freedom of the press, and Turkey's access to the European Union.
After that, Erdogan went to the Colony to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turkish residents outside of Turkey.
The security measures set by the police, which were intended to gather in front of the mosque, were blocked by 25,000 people, but several supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan (most of which were Kurdish) gathered their voices to protest against the decision taken by the Erdogan political forces and the German government to welcome the president.
The presidents reflected the heated disagreements between the two sides; some Turks in Germany say he is a hero and others say he is only an autocrat.
The Deptford road accident: a cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
A man was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred on the outskirts of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m., and the Deptford road to the south-east of the city is usually overcrowded.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died there.
On Childers Street, a mile from Saturday's accident, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver fled.
The Metropolitan Police are working to identify the man and alert his family.
Several roads have been closed and the permanent route of the bus lines has changed; motorists are also advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in a Slut
Six officers in the prison have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison's offices said.
The HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire was set up at 9:30 a.m. (BST) on Sunday morning and the riots have not yet ended.
"Tornado" officials have arrived to finish the eight-year prison sentence, which has now been confined to one of the building's flights.
The officers had small wounds on their faces and they were healed there.
A representative of the expert service said: "We have sent experts to HMP Long Lartin to end the hiccups.
We have cured six workers for the injuries they have sustained.
We will not accept any violence in our prisons, and we will deliver those who have started a riot to the police, and we are sure they will spend much more time between the bars of the prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees and, among them, the country’s criminal gangsters.
In June, the prison mayor had to go to the hospital for the attack of an inmate.
In addition, in the autumn of last year, counter-insurgency officers had to go to prison to stop a serious fight, as the arrested workers were attacking with billiards.
Rosa has become a threat to hurricanes with sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (it would be possible to extract some of the most remote areas benefits)
It’s very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but that’s what will happen next week when the Rose River drains its power; it will visit the southwest wilderness and there’s a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already sent a warning to Las Vegas on Mondays and Fridays about sudden waves that can occur; it will enter the hurricane from the west of Arizona, and it will go south and east of Nevada. It will also pass through Las Vegas, California, and Utah, to the south and east of Las Vegas.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the storms that will be on Monday will make her arrival heard.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix wrote this in a statement: "Since the 1950s, ten tropical cyclones from Phoenix to 200 million have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a 40-million-dollar hurricane due to the US border.
According to the latest announcements by the National Hurricane Center, 2-4 percent of the water will be collected and 6 percent of the water will be collected at the mouth of Mogollon, Arizona.
With respect to other areas of the southwest of the Basque Country (the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, the others), 1-2 ounces of water will be collected; 4 ounces will be collected in isolated places.
As for those who hope for a sudden flood, the Rosa River may be a blessing, for the crops that the land has endured.
Floods do not need to be reduced, but these storm surges can be beneficial for the crops that are suffering from the southwest.
According to the U.S. Cattle Control Service, there are 40 serious Cattle in Arizona, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First of all, the route of the Rosa Hurricane will pass through the Mexican Baja California Peninsula.
The strength of the Rosa hurricane will be maintained on Sunday morning and will generate winds of up to 85 million hours; it will then be 385 million miles from the south of Mexico's Punta Eugenia, and it will be 12 million/hour.
The storm is finding colder water in the Pacific and, as a result, is weakening its capacity.
In this way, it will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night as a tropical storm.
Since there may be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high flood risk.
According to the weather.com website, "rain boots will leave 3-6 inches of water from Baja California to the southwest of Sonora, and could collect 10 inches in some places".
Rosa will then pass through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before the Arizona border arrives in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression; after that, she will cross Arizona and go south to Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threats to the Rose or its storms are severe storms that will occur in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert in the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These storms will create one-on-one ripples and dangerous landslides in the wilderness and the landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Kill Someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for murder after finding a 16-year-old boy with a knife in Somerset.
He was wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northone on Saturday morning at 04:00 (BST).
She was taken to the hospital and her condition is “stable.”
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area (Avon and Somerset), police said.
If someone recorded or traced what happened to the phone, the police officers have asked for his help.
Trump says Kavanaugh must endure “unreasonable atrocity” of the Democratic Party
"The votes given to Kavanaugh's judge are abrogating the unwarranted and irritating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheelingen, West Virginia.
In addition, Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure the "insensibility and anger" of the Democratic party in his nomination process.
On Tuesday, Kavanaugh made a squabble before Congress, and completely overturned the claim made by Christine Blasey Ford; according to the woman, a few decades ago when Kavanaugh was raped by a few.
Ford also made a statement after he heard his complaint.
The president said on Saturday: "The citizens of the United States saw Kavanaugh's courage, wisdom and quality on that day."
"The elections to elect Judge Kavanaugh are echoing the best legislation of our time; this lawyer has given his entire life to protect the public service," he told supporters in West Virginia.
Not only about Kavanaugh's nomination, but the president also spoke about the importance that the Republican party has in these elections.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important election of our lives.
I will not participate, but I will campaign,” he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight for the better candidates."
In addition, Trump said the Democratic Party is using strategies to “block and complicate” the campaign.
According to a senior Republican party official to CNN, the process of voting to appoint Kavanaugh will take place in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami; the death toll rises
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, most of which were killed by massive waves while the beaches were destroyed.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a holiday in the city of Pau, but in the dark six-meter (18 feet) waves swept the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything on the road was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat alert was sent yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing a number of activities and they did not immediately escape; that's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian disaster prevention agency (BNPB) spokesman.
"Tsunami tracked cars, sewers and homes and destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroh says; more so, the tsunami traveled from the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
“A number of people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have come out alive,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have gone to the Palau 24 centers.
Several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn down and a mosque surrounded by water can be seen in the aerial photographs taken by the disaster agencies.
On Saturday, the Earth's repellents continued to smother the coast.
Earthquakes were observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT), the energy level released by the main earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Perhaps the geography of the city, which is in a long and dense state, is related to the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroho, the disaster has been a "major" one; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims have been found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, resulting in 540 more wounded and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said that the number of casualties and damage could be increased along the 300-kilometre (190-mile) coast of Paluku, especially a place called Dongala, which is near the epicentre.
Donggala’s communications “are not working and we have no information,” Nugroho said.
According to the Red Cross data, there are more than 300,000 people in the area; for now, the organization’s employees and volunteers are going to places where they can offer assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received harsh criticism for failing to provide information about the tsunami that Palu destroyed, but officials said the waves appeared to be on the air after the alert was broadcast.
In a video shared on social networks, a man in a building can be seen shouting "there's a tsunami coming" to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, she arrives at the water-hormone coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake caused by the tsunamis created a general power outage, which halted all communications in the Palace, so it was difficult for the authorities to organise reclamation efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities to the slaughterhouses, but the evacuated still need food and priority goods.
The city's airport is reopened to facilitate assistance efforts and will be closed to the public until the bridge.
The president of the Widodo game will visit the Paluk evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami has left more than 800 dead.
It is a tragedy.
Workers from Donggala’s World Vision organization have arrived in the city of Palu without any problems (the workers who have recently been building shelters in the courtyard of the organization’s office) but have seen directly the appalling situation left by the disaster, Mr. Doseb<0xC3><0xA1> said.
"They told me they saw a pile of houses destroyed," he said.
That's very bad.
Although the aid teams did the sad work-arounds in the case of disasters, some of the highly experienced workers and helpers complained that they had been advised not to go to Palura.
Following Indonesian law, international financing, supply and supply of workers can only be classified as a disaster in the national zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level disaster,” says Aulia Arranik, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we'll be able to open the door to international aid, but it's still not classified as such."
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, Palun's friends and families who were still missing had not yet lost hope of a golden miracle likely to appear to their loved ones.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of the stable.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, holding her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a member of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two paragliders who were part of the missing Asian Games, which ended up in Indonesia this month.
Some of the others who were caught at the Roa Roa hotel, including Jn. Mandadi, were students.
“As an expert in the world of phenomena, I have an emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Jn. told the paraplegic community that in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was sending WhatsApp messages to competitors, who were at a beach party.
His messages, however, only got a single gray goat, not two blue marks.
"I think that means they didn't send those messages," he added.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they were filling the automatic boxes at Newport on the Levene
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a worker who was filling an automatic Newport on the Brinke Box, according to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was locking the automatic box in the complex entertainment and preparing to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
As he was working, another man "attacked Brinke's worker behind him" and stole a bag of money he had to hand over.
The locals had seen several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of participants who were taken by surprise.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper has changed his name, and now
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye and now.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter: "The creature was known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been using Ye's illness for some time, and has used that illness as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, where he hoped Yandhi would release his last album.
He took part in Ariana Grande's performance, in the words of the show's creator, because she was unable to participate due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has also stated that this word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible and 'you' means 'you' in the Bible,'" West said recently, speaking about the album with a big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which is the only one that means to turn Ye into the island of our good, our bad, our confusion and everyone else.
This work better reflects who we are.”
It is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he says he prefers the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, has also changed serious grammar and vocabulary.
Mexico’s AMLO says it will not use its military against its citizens
The president-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised that he will not use military force or army against the people, when the country sheds blood on its students during the 50th anniversary of a crackdown.
Lopez Obrador swore on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use an army to repress Mexican citizens."
On October 2, 1968, the army fired on the plaza against a peaceful protest, killing 300 friends to fuel a left-wing student uprising throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrado has spoken that he will help Mexico learn, with the help of funeral funds and more from the public university of Do<0xC3><0xB1>a.
In his words, the lack of opportunities for unemployment and education is driving young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the number it uses to research in that field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AAN expert, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The images were created when they made several announcements around the AA from various parts of the U.S. government, although the U.S. generally does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the best AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AA research would be a good start, as other countries are far from the U.S. and are looking for the next AA discovery," Lee said.
Bilateral financing in the U.S. could double the chances of making major AA discoveries, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Chief Executive Officer of Innovation Ventures, who has researched one of China's leading AA companies, Face++.
During the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University surpassed the American high-end Othello player in an AA system and later served as president of Microsoft Research and Google in the Chinese field.
Lee praised the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, including the Robotic Competition of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next dreamer.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the government's money, Lee says.
“It doesn’t mean that China is led by academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee added.
Facebook, Google, and a number of other tech companies have taken the spotlight from universities in recent years to engage in AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policies would also help the U.S. promote AA activities.
"I think the green card should automatically be offered to AA doctors," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China is funded by the National Science Foundation and some other government organizations as it does in the U.S. by people from academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
That year, earlier, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, where industry and education partners met, and the White House announced that it had formed the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for NSFrent, it invests more than $100 million a day per year in the AA research.
Meanwhile, the EU’s legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in recent months.
The Macedonians had a referendum to change the name of the country to decide whether or not to change the name of the country.
Macedonia voted by referendum on Sunday to change the name of the "Old Republic of Macedonia" or not to decide. This change would bring an end to decades of conflict, since Greece blocked the possibility of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, the former province of Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbors still takes its territory, blocking it from entering NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say this change is due to the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign had caused him to doubt whether he would achieve 50 per cent of what he would have to achieve in the referendum.
This is the question that could be read in the referendum paper: “Are you on the side of being a NATO and EU member with the approval of Greece?”
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it deserves the opportunity to join the EU and NATO organizations for Macedonia, as one of the countries that was created when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I am going to vote on the future of the people, for young people in Macedonia, so that we can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which will bring us a safer way of life," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the fact that it is not legally binding, members of parliament have indicated that the outcome of the vote will continue to be decisive.
Three members of Parliament will be required to change their name.
The U.S. Election Commission said it had not given a surprise update until about an hour later.
However, only 16 votes cast, 66 votes cast in favour of 34 votes in the last parliamentary election of 2016, in which 66 votes were cast.
“I went to vote for my children, there’s our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko changed their vote in the Macedonian referendum to change the country’s name and to have the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, who was preparing a small show and climbing stairs, wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the European Union, but we want to agree with our terms and conditions and not put them at the door of the servers," Kavadarkov said.
“We’re poor, but we have dignity.
If we don't want to be like Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO members can bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.
"I think the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 per cent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
In his words, “yes” would “renew our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Organizations, it would take part in the vote between 30 and 43 percent of voters - fewer than necessary.
Another poll, Macedonian TV’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of residents thought they were going to vote on Sunday.
He said that 70 percent of the population would be thrown away.
In order for the referendum to be successful, more than 50 votes per cent must be obtained.
If there was a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious failure of Western politics since it began in May.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero has surpassed Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in a 2-0 Saturday victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium football stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian goal scored a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between the three defenders in Brighton, before being swept into the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green elastic bands.
He pushed a defender out of so many others after fleeing on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he walked to the left, and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero in the air at the first touch, and he used his right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"There are a lot of problems at the foot of the mountain," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were very happy to have him in the game at the time.”
But Sterling gave the blue elastics the initial advantage in the Premier League competitions.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in Brighton's field in the game.
He gave Leroy Saneri a great pass from the left.
Sane had a few touches on the distant hill before heading for Sterling.
The blue elastic pushed the ball into the net before it left the line.
City Hoffenheim will compete in the Champions League on Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the competition, there was no reason to force another start.
However, Scherzer, who is always a contender, wants to take advantage of the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but they still experience the consequences of equality with the Rockies, who still call the Los Angeles Dodgers a game advantage in the NL West.
The Rockies have won a comfortable 5-2 win to the Nationals on Friday night, but will still have to try to win the first-class title.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we know that the Denver round is going to be overrun by people, and the opposing teams will have to play at the best level in every arena we have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals still need to announce a starter, but it seems that they will leave Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have made his 34th start, made a shooting attempt on Thursday and seems to have done the right thing as a shooter on Sunday.
Washington's hands are 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and scored 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's remarks in West Virginia
The president examined the situation and referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who was elected by the Supreme Court, when he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we did was in November.
We have five weeks of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big ones -- I'm not a candidate but, because I am, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for big candidates."
Trump added, “You can see the terrible Democratic party, you can see what’s going on right now.
And they have no doubt to remove the power to use any means necessary, see wisdom, see dignity.
It doesn’t matter who I hurt, who I’ve passed over to get control and power over, or we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the goal of “repeating and suppressing.”
"Because you've been able to see it for the last four days," he added, "the Democrats are angry and stupid, and they're dirty and they're fake."
It was named after the Democratic Party Senator Dianne Feinstein, from the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received the shouts from the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for someone - that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The workers will not continue to be a great iris.
It’s intolerant of what they think.
When the activists on my local side voted against me, it was not a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last one on the list we didn't welcome from Labour MPs - because we all think we are.
Joan Ryan, a Member of Parliament, also received similar treatment because she spoke out on behalf of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the sense-motions criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders on similar issues.
The news surrounding Friday's Eastern Nottingham meeting said "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years that I have served as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been like that.
Unfortunately, today we do not remember the word to make politics "pleasant, respectful", if ever there was.
It remains to be seen whether there are different views of the Labour Party and whether opinions are acceptable to the Party's leaders or not.
When Jeremy became the leader, we had the same political views before, and I would never accept them when they asked me to accept the views – both regarding national security and the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak to the public, no matter what I say, the bitter opinion of those in the social network who are demanding that I be removed from it, it happens that I should not be on the Labour side.
This is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have better luck than some of my members, because the opinions I have cast against me are political.
Every day of sexism or rationality, with professionalism and honesty, but never with shame, I am the age of friends who have to deal with it.
One of the unfortunate aspects of politics at this time is that the current level of punishment seems normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not get a single opinion in every motion of "trust" or when the rules of the party become stricter.
Over the last two years, I have received several and many notices to fall down, not to speak so much, and thus to say, "I would be fine."
I’m not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I dropped out of the room where Thatcher’s government’s carelessness pushed me down and entered the public services I needed most – as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will have any doubt about my political views and the disagreements I have with the current leader.
I would say to those who have encouraged Friday’s motion that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand my loyalty to the Labour Party’s leaders in discussing the loss of time and energy.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether or not to be a member of the Labour Party: I am very proud to work for you and to speak to you for your best interest in continuing to work for those who are not going to leave me with threats or political expeditions.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr has a leader who has not lost a match yet
Surprisingly, the last two attempts somehow changed the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in Tennent's wonderful and fun day game.
They are in first place at the table, and they are the only ones who have not lost a single game.
In the end, they had a better defense, and they took better advantage of the options. The home team and coach Peter Murchie have the full right to be happy.
"They've tested us so far, and we haven't lost a single one, so we need to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose added: "My honor is Ayr, because they used the options better than we did."
The 14th-minute interception of Grant Anderson, by Frazier Climo, before Ayr put it on, but those cards issued to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, leaving the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrosi and Jason Baggot to add points.
Climo blocked Ayr's leader through a penalty. Before, at the end of the first part, he made a solitary spell and Ayr went 17-5 to rest.
But Melrose got off to a great start in the second half, and the intrigue of Patrick Anderson, Baggot's work, narrowed the gap by five points.
Then there was a long pause for Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which they pulled out of their hands and, upon returning to the game, Ayr came further away when Stafford McDowall's cousin Climo became.
Then, Blair Macpherson Ayr's captain got that card out, and again, Melros got the benefit of being more of a man, which didn't happen to Bruce Colvin's widow, to the end of his life.
The houses turned around and, when Struan Hutchinsoni's card came out, he noticed that Climo had no balls, from the penalty margin, MacPherson went ahead and touched the ground behind Ayr's team's goal.
Cleimo did so much, as he did almost from the beginning, when Kyle Rowek caught David Armstrong's chest and took Gregor Henry out of the fifth floor of the house.
Still Game series stars will kick off a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Ford Kieran wants to plunge into the world of hospitality, knowing that they have been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC show, alongside long-time writer and star Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the show would be the final season, the ninth, and it seems Kiernan Craiglang's next life is being planned.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor doesn't want to say anything about the story, although sources from the Scottish Sun magazine said he wanted to enter a "brand of important establishments" in Kiernan Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia in the interior hopes the courts will reopen the way to the Pacific
The patrol of the seamen is the main site of the La Paz shipbuilding apparatus.
Public buildings have blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon you can read the following line: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it.”
Throughout Bolivia, blood-soaked conflicts on the Chilean coast of the 19th century are still alive - as they continue to sea in the Bare Ocean.
These expectations may be stronger now than they have been in recent decades, as Bolivia is expected to decide on October 1 after five years of reflection by the International Court of Justice.
“Bolivia is living in the right moment, with a sense of unity and calmness, and of course, it’s waiting for a good result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow through the huge screens scattered across the country through the decision of the International Court of Justice, with the hope that the Courts of the Sea will give reasons to Bolivia's demands - after decades of negotiations that have lasted - to force the Chilean government to stop the fire.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charming indigenous president – who is in trouble for re-election next year – has also made a number of moves around Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Ocean Bar," he said at the end of last August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide on Bolivia’s side and, as a result, will not change much.
The United Nations agency, which is set up on Wednesday, does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and states that it does not decide on the outcome of the negotiations that may be held.
The decision of the International Court of Justice concluded negotiations and six months later said the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zarat, an expert on international law in Chile.
And rather than justifying the cause of Bolivia, they have backtracked over the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken the issue of reaching the sea as a challenge," said Zarat.
The rhetoric of President Morales has shattered all the desire to do well in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile still need to address a number of issues, but it will be very difficult to continue the debate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in Havana, disagrees with those who say the court’s decision is particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia said it "will have a great opportunity to re-establish relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreement, for the good of the two."
Calzadilla said Morales, still one of South America's most popular presidents, has not agreed with those who say he uses the problem of the sea to get political help.
"Bolivia will never deny them the right to have a way to the Ocean Bar," he added.
“It’s an opportunity we’ve seen to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can be believed in the U.S.
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country is not armed until it can be believed in Washington.
This was stated by Rik in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States on the Singaporean side, in front of the leaders of the armed forces, to fulfill the word given.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State for Singapore and Kim Jong Un of North Korea, said he has been on the verge of blocking nuclear diplomacy for more than three months.
Rik says that the “utopia” of the sanctions continued and that before the end of the Korean War, the U.S. sanctions would put North Korea on its feet.
Washington does not want Pyongyang to agree to a cease-fire before making any moves.
Yes, Kim wants US President Donald Trump to be the second president.
But there's a lot of skepticism around Pyongyang that's seriously going on because it's the only way to ensure its security that the country seems to have around all the weapons around it.
Pompeo's intention is to go to Pyongyang next month to organize the second round of talks between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Showcases the Newest Line of Massive Chapels on Your Next High Street Road
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or if you want to completely block the sun, here is the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the creation of the unusually large chapel in the spring-summer 2019 collection, which left the style shown on Paris Fashion Week in disarray.
This summer, non-practical hats have arrived on Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the pass.
Valentino's most notable pieces, with a beix-coloured chandelier-shaped wing, covered the heads of the models.
Among the other supplements of large size we have a bizarrely filled grain-like, oddly narrow chapel, and also a pineapple-like - but they are not designed to heat the head.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of bizarre masks - time for Halloween.
Many color-filled masks have lips, and Hannibal Lecter's are more like top-notch ones.
One seemed to be a mask for snorkeling, with a window and a shovel, and the other was an ice-cold cocoon.
If you are a fashion follower, you have good news.
Experts in the style say that hate will go out on the streets, even to those around you.
The large hats come from behind ‘La Bomba’, a two-foot wide-flying cargo hat that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the chapel, which has never been successful in social networks, has brought another object to the passageway - a bag of sand for the beach, almost as big as the model of the bathroom it carries.
The raffle orange bag, cut with raffle lace and finished with a white leather jacket, is Jacquemus’s La Riviera 2019 Spring-summer collection protagonist at the Paris Fashion Week..
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope the big hats and the big beach bags will reach the main streets next summer, it would be difficult with the great excitement that the designer has had to keep up with the demands of the giants."
John Edward: Basic Language Skills for Global Citizens <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Independent schools in Scotland are making academic excellence records, and in 2018 they continued to review the results of the study with separate results, which will determine which group results are consolidated with excellent results in sports, among others, in music and in other projects of the association.
With 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Councils of the School of Independents are trying to provide the best service between the students and their parents.
The aim of the independent school is to prepare students for higher education, for their chosen career and as citizens.
Since we are able to design and implement the school’s personalized curriculum as a learning sector, we have seen that modern languages continue to be the usual option chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak in a language that someone understands, you will come to yourself.
If you speak in his language, you will come to his heart.”
It’s a powerful way to remember that we don’t have to build relationships with people in other countries and use only English to gain confidence in them.
From the results of this year’s final examinations, we can see that there are languages in the upper part of most of the independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of the students who study foreign languages have achieved the best A-level qualification.
The data, compiled by 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 per cent of students have achieved the A-ranked best in Mandarin Chinese; 72 per cent in German; 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in French.
This proves that the independent schools of Scotland see foreign languages as the indispensable skills that young people and children will undoubtedly need in the future. . . .
Languages, today, work as a teacher in the curricula of independent schools (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), among others.
A 2014 survey by the European Commission found that one of the main reasons it was found at the time to fill the job was language ignorance.
More and more, knowledge of languages is becoming indispensable in preparing young people for future careers.
With more language-demanding job opportunities, these skills are indispensable in the globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime of this kind.
Being able to speak directly to people from foreign countries will automatically put the person in the head of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey of 4,000 people in the EU, 75 per cent of them could not speak a foreign language, such as an ordinary conversation, and between them speaking only French, the two-digit figure rose to 15 per cent.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in today’s children when teaching languages.
Speaking more than one language, most of which is used in economic development, will give your children more opportunities to find a better job.
In Scotland, schools are distinguished by the language they teach.
One number of students prefers a more modern classical language, and the others seem to be more important for EB by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
As your child’s interests are, there will always be a wide range of language opportunities to study at an independent school, with teachers who are experts in the field.
The aim of the independent school in Scotland is to prepare children for success in the future and to provide tools for it.
This time, we cannot deny, in an international business environment, where languages are essential for the future of the country, so that is necessary in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "the ability to communicate internationally."
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers in San Diego on Monday.
LeBron James, the first-class star to make his Los Angeles debut, is about to end the wait.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has said that James will play in Monday's pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still hasn’t figured out how many minutes he’ll play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a journalist at Lakers, said on Twitter that James will play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked at the Lakers about the six-game schedule.
"I don't need a preliminary game to prepare for this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Championship, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start the rally campaign campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
Trump will be the first of five rallies next week and will visit several places he has friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Looking forward to the vote that would give the Supreme Court a resounding vote to fill the square, Trump wants to get help or protection for midterm elections, as well as for Republicans at risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What time is the West Virginia Trump myth and how can it be seen on the Internet?
Trump's tour of West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to watch Trump’s West Virginia myth online via YouTube stream.
It seems that Trump will direct this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until the Senate's re-election is held as a result of sexual misconduct.
But the main goal of this mythical round is to help Republicans win some votes in the November elections.
Trump’s campaign, therefore, says the goal of the next week’s five rallies is to “suspense volunteers and help support the majority of those in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress's countermeasures are of particular importance, and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not give permission to give his name, told Reuters.
The Wesbanco Arena program will allow Wheeling, the current myth of Ohio and Pennsylvania fans and Pittsburgh's media coverage, according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by 40 points in a quarter of 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey, a Republican from Virginia, who is going after him.
It’s not a good sign for Morrisey to have the president go there to help with the election,” said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will try to keep up with Sunday's tournament
After three one-sided sessions, it was said that Saturday afternoon's quarterback Ryder Cup needed this.
The key to the moment is the concept of the sport invented from the top down, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say the time is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think it's time now, sort of," Jordan Spiethe said in a one-day field play.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points, out of the ten in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is not on their side, and they need help, mostly Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points from the field.
Spieth has been absolutely decisive, from the equation to the green, and he is dealing with the model.
These celebratory cries have been more and more loud as the gangs moved on, and he welcomed the important pot, winning four all-square, after Thomas lost two.
He celebrated the 15th game with another like-for-like cry, indicating that the American team is not out of the competition.
“You have to look for strength and take care only of your game,” Spiethe said.
It’s what keeps these players going.
18 holes to get out.
The only players who have scored more points than Spiethe and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the historic players of the Ryder Cup championship.
The European couple are special but the charms are four out of four that have failed.
"Moliwood" was a Saturday afternoon bogey that did not shoot a single couple, but on Saturday morning, even on Friday afternoon, the bogees were avoided and the last nine on Friday.
This scandal and the people who came from it turned into a couple to overcome the energy they had come from Sunday, and it wasn’t until Fleetwood and Molinari were the more famous European players to close the sun to Europe’s victory at Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both in a different hole.
It’s too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio Garcia's work, the best of the quarter, when he was compared to Alex Norne.
They put a Bogey and two pairs in front of them in a hole that was never close to defeating the Spanish and the Swedish.
However, on Sunday, there was no one to help you get out of your hole.
Seeing the interaction between the two close to the square, they gave their advice, what they did not give, and at some point they saw how the strategy could be changed.
Europe played better as a team, and had a notable advantage in the final, but the quarter-finals showed that the U.S. teams had a tendency to fight, even if some, especially Stateside, questioned them.
Europe have a 10-6 advantage in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe made a notable advantage in the Ryder Cup final, after Saturday’s quarter-finals 10–6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, inspired by the couple, won two victories against Tiger Woods, and have now scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, who two years ago wanted to regain the prize he lost to Hazelin, was the boss in the morning and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance, and won two games, but were unable to overcome the side.
They needed eight points from Jim Furyk's side to hold the prize in Sunday's 12 individual matches.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to have won four points in a row and, along with Molinari, after a great weekend called "Molliwood", they are the second to win four points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed's retirement from the Fourballs, he performed well in the tired Woods game, surpassing Bryson Dechambeau's American rookie with 5 and 4 lights.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturdays, showed a touch of excellence, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursomes, followed by seven.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning four-ball and returned with Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to win 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best and third in the world.
Europe did not find its way to a pleasant, fresh, south-western day in Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomase set an American reference, two points, on Saturday.
They won 2-1 in a four-ball game against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and also defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy after losing the first two holes in the 4&3 qualifiers.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup championship has a team managed to surpass the four-point field and enter the individual field, although the Furyken field needed nothing more than equal support for the prize.
After the second best two days, after the effect against Sunday, they will be put in front of him.
North Korea has refused to allow weapons to be dropped without any confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday issued a warning to the United Nations that the sanctions continue to undermine confidence in the United States and will not, at any rate, stop nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Summit of the Year that North Korea had taken "significant measures" last year to supply nuclear weapons and missile tests, to leave nuclear test sites and to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and, at any rate, we cannot leave the first arms alone."
Rik reiterates North Korean family complaints about Washington's resistance to denuclearization in a "phased" process, where North Korea would be rewarded for giving a little bit of distance. Its statements seem to be indicative of the past's disapproval of Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump refer to the first device held by the U.S. President and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore. Then, Kim promised to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula", and Trump vowed to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must abandon its first weapons.
Washington has not made any concessions to the international voices calling for the reduction of the sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is once again saying that it will have to abandon its first weapons and continue to increase the level of punishment pressure, towards forcing them to achieve their goal, and against the 'expression of the end of the war'," Rik said.
“Citizens are utopians who don’t know how to think that they’ll put us on their feet.
The problem is that the continued punishments are increasing.”
Rike did not mention the second device between Kim and Trump to be announced by U.S. leaders at the beginning of the week.
The minister, on the other hand, referred to three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae, adding: "If the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be blocked."
However, the tone of Rie’s speech would be completely different last year, where he stated at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was inevitably looking at missiles in the United States, since Trump called the “devil president” Kimi the “missile master” of the suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who would “cut” North Korea, said he praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to get rid of the weapons, but said he still needed to do so and would continue to punish North Korea with impunity.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for it, "even if it's two years, three years or five months," he said.
China and Russia believe the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the sanctions it has imposed on the country.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be tightened, without fail, until we prove that its denuclearization is real.”
The Security Council has single-handedly encouraged North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to block the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programmes.
He met with Pompeo Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second round.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not well.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, he said that he had achieved nothing for North Korea alone, after accusing North Korea of "requesting what the gangs are doing."
"North Korea swore at a meeting with Moon that they would abandon a missile site and a nuclear complex if they took the measures that the United States was responsible for."
Kimi said the “measures related to them” he was looking for were Singapore’s promised security and were aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students have learned how to take a break as much as they need.
This year’s Harvard University studies will make undergraduates more sleep-deprived, to try to cope with the culture they are learning by taking coffee for granted.
One teacher saw at the best university in the world that the student loses the prize in a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the study, which is believed to be the first in the EU.
At the time of study, when he gave a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation, he began to study.
"At the end, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do I have to do that now only in my last year of school?'
He said no one told me how important it is to sleep well, and that surprised me," said the Telegraph.
During the course, this year’s offer explains the impact that proper sleep habits have on students’ learning and sports outcomes, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barrey, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Medicine and director of health services at the university, said the university decided to start the study when it saw that students slept less during the week.
Long-term learning takes on a number of interactive challenges.
In one room, there is a picture of a room where students can see the effect of coffee and light, as well as the impact of coffee boats, courts, trainers and books, and the importance of seeing and sleeping habits that have little effect on the performance of the sport.
In another section, participants are told to play with the heart to reduce the amount of sleep they have, and that it can increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On an outdoor map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on the daily habits of the participants.
“We know that we will not suddenly change the habits of our students.
But we think that they have the right to know that if you choose to smoke cigarettes, you have the right to know the consequences that will have on your health," adds Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride in making "achievement", he says, and the more modern technology and students are affected by it, the greater the pressure or the less it increases the problem of doing it.
Sleeping well, with a good quality bed, should be a "secret weapon" to deal with stress, fatigue and nervousness, he said - as well as to gain weight, because doing little sleep puts the brain in the form of hunger and will always be hungry for us.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who has studied chemical and physical biology, helped design a study for Professor Czeisler, and in his first year at Harvard he had one of his first classes.
The student stated that he had opened his eyes and encouraged him to take part in a study he took part in on campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask graduates to do a similar research before entering a competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students put an alarm to determine when to go to bed, as well as to sign up, and that electronic screens and LED lights emit the harmful effects of "blue light", which can lead to changes in the circadian rhythms.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengak Gerrarden beats men
The Ranger suffered another defeat in Dolly Mengar's strike against Steven Gerrard in Livingston's 1-0 lead.
Ibrox wanted to win for the first time after winning 4–1 St. Johnston on Friday, but Gary Holter's team caused Gerrarder's second defeat as coach in his 18th game, his eight points being left unchecked by the heartbreaks of the Landbrokes Championship leader.
Menga was on strike seven minutes before the break, and Rangers' work did not achieve the same.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, while Livingston is in third place and are only behind Hibernians for the side of the goal.
The problem could have been more serious for Rangers because they had to be treated for a head injury on Calum Spence flight, and an object was said to have been thrown out.
Gerrard made eight changes and managed to reach the finals of Ayr Betfred Kopar.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi 11, who took a point from Heartsei last week and might be happy to see his well-dressed opponents fill in every round.
The Rangers took possession of the property, but Livingston brought out a greater benefit to their players.
Menga's Scott Pittmani would have to score a goal shot through Allan McGregor, but the midfielder did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw at Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to get away to the back of the hill.
The Rangers took control, but in the end, it seemed as if the expectation of their game was greater than the belief.
Alfredo Morelos was thought to have been a penalty within the limits of the fourth, when he and Steven Lawless made a squabble, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept the colonial appeals.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots to come out in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be Ibrox's goalkeeper, had almost no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's soft kick.
Livy's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the game's turn, but no one can deny that they were worth the effort.
Once again, Rangers did not manage to face a player who would stop Jacobs' balls.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Gerrard took possession of Coulibaly during the break with Ryan Kent, and the changes had an immediate effect when the plane passed Morelos, but Kelly's formidable run from his line to block it.
But the Livingstons continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase his advantage, but McGregor remained calm before making a head come from the corner of Lithgow.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, eventually applied for a penalty again when he wrestled with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't do it again.
German: inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA AURRERA ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity: the invention came after him as the so-called Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has been a frontier of science, and has also become a frontier of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were the unsung protagonists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger counter is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium, for example.
When you put these hearing aids in, you can hear the effects of the atoms that are affected by the radioactivity of minerals.”
Evans: "Yes, it's heard right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, missing a few days to turn 63.
But the imagination of his name is still alive.

The results of the test are very good in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that she was known to have a bad immune system cell, in particular, had her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is based on this: when the patient removes and changes the immune cells in the laboratory, it is possible to "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then to re-inject the cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer at Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a great future.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of many types of cancers," including breast, ovary, colon and wave cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and how to get to the cell's "teaching" path has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined a debate on Trump’s side, wearing a MAG chaplain, following the SNL event.
It was not well out.
Kanye West shouted at the studio on Saturday Night Live when Donald Trump praised the president of the United States and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, Make America Great dressed up in a champ, began to speak ill of the Democrats and rekindle Trump's attitude.
“Every time I talk to a white person, I’m told, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
Matt Damon began the session with a sketch starring SNLk. In that sketch, Christine Blasey Ford made a joke about the allegations of sexual assault made by Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Even if it's not raining, West's terrible speech has risen to the social network of comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock West was trying to make fun of the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had misbehaved between the flights and that he was his chaplain.
"I've been attacked in the air.
They told me, "Don't go out with that chaplain."
I was attacked!
And then they say I'm in a deep place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see where the ball is going?" and said, "I'm going to wear my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to move on?
“Try the love.”
As a result of his words, jokes came from the public at least a couple of times and the members of the SNL session seemed embarrassed, as Variety reported, and one person there told the magazine: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, who died a few days earlier with a boyfriend, rapper Rac Miller.
The web surprised many with the interpretation of the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the protection of Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA conservation team, who published this quote: "Spiritually to one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR A BIG GOLD MAFIAR."
But as Karen Hunter teased about the interview attempt, West was simply "being like what it looks like, and that's great."
“But I don’t want to reward a person who makes an ideology harmful to the community (by buying his music or clothes or protecting his ‘art’).
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the session, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "now called Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also had the name Snoop Lion, and how not to mention the recent music legend Prince, who changed his name to a poem and became the artist Prince until then.
Charged with murdering a Belfast restaurant for infringing
A 45-year-old man was found dead on Friday after a man was raped in a restaurant in east Belfast.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The indictment is due to appear in Belfast’s First Judicial Court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has appeared against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington Jon Snow is best known for his role in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has come up against the stereotype of male domination, saying that as a result of the appearance of such papers on the screen, young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and asked him how he should deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during #MeToo.
Kit is also the star of Game of Thrones and recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, and she admitted that she needs to deal with the problem.
'Personally, and with great certainty, I'm thinking right now - what have we done wrong with masculinity?' he said.
“What did we teach when men were growing up, given the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can also have its own responsibility for the rise of toxic masculinity, as a result of the character being very masculine.
He continued, “What is special and what is taught?
What does it teach on television, and in the streets, how do boys feel about being that way of being a man?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time.
It’s a shame that something bad has happened to young people.”
He also admitted in interviews that he did not have any previous or subsequent Game of Thrones series when the series ended the next summer, and said that he had 'endowed with battlefields and horses'.
From November onwards, Kit Sam Shepard will appear at the Return of True West. It is the story of a film producer and his brother; his brother is a thief.
The actor recently announced that he thinks his wife Rose has met the best thing Game of Thrones has given him.
"I met my wife at this session, and so my future family and from here on out gave me a life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's favorite character Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
GIB/Finance: China has reported a 14% rise in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people with GIB and HIV.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
More than 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, and this is a change for the past.
Traditionally, GIB has spread rapidly due to blood transfusions that have been contaminated in some areas of China.
But in this way, the number of people infected with GIB was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a Yunnan provincial conference.
However, the number of people with GIB and Iesa in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
Gender-based GIB transmission is a serious problem in China’s LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
According to the country’s conservatives, 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men are married to a woman.
Many transmissions of the disease occur in relationships because of the use of sexual-protective disorders.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to GIB medicine in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied workers' filtered GOP senators' data, and has set up 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Maxine Waters on Saturday accused a member of her factory of publishing the personal information of three U.S. senators on the legal Wikipedia pages.
Democrats in Los Angeles have said the allegations were motivated by "ultra-southern" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more blatant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah, appeared in the press release.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, in an interview with an unknown person published in Capitol Hill, during a hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court of the Senate.
Three senators asked Kavanaugh about the leak, and he came later.
According to Gateway Pundit and RedState's website, the source-identifying IP address was linked to the Waters office and published information from a member of the Waters plant, Hill said.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
"The members of my work - who are at risk for the quality, personal information and security of these fraudulent allegations - have no responsibility for the filtering of that information.
The baseless claim is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters immediately received criticism online, for example, by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
"That silence is made out of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“It shows that there is no nature to be a member of Congress.
When someone says something they don’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn’t have to show any challenge.
There is no need to question the defendant’s reasons.
It has to be calm and peaceful.”
It seemed that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism made by the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who had expressed outrage at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the mid-term elections, said on Twitter.
"If it's true," he whispered.
In his statements, Waters said that he had warned his offices "that the authorities and law-enforcement entities were right about these fraudulent statements.
“We ensure that those who have broken the law know what they are,” he continued, “and that they will have to respond to the law with regard to any action that is harmful and dangerous to any member of my household.”
Johnny English Strikes Again film review - parody of Rowan Atkinson's spy
Now it has become traditional to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that has a British spy, and it seems that this is not applicable in the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise. It began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back again in 2011 with Johnny English.
In particular, will we get a new export option for our nation by saturating ourselves with the account that shows us what kind of waste we are?
In any use, Johnny English’s large-eyed and cheeky faces have renewed his license to tear things apart for the second time: his name shows a comical creation designed for lands that don’t see English cinema on top of everything.
Although Glamour has a special desire to win the Lausanne, Clouseu is a somewhat secretive agent, of course, also a spy for Mr Bean, as well as a boy who helps Chariots of Fire with a single note during the inaugural season of the 2012 London Olympics.
In Barclaycard's television commercials we have already forgotten, Atkinson interpreted the traveler and even if he is based on the mysterious international man himself, leave him behind the chaos.
There's a moment or two in this last hour of JER.
I liked how Johnny English approached the helicopter when he was wearing a Mid-Auric armor and was told that the rotor's crosses hit him on the helmet.
Atkinson sees the doll for comedy on the screen, but humor is lacking in strength and superfluidity, especially when the movie "series", such as 007 and Mission Impossible, are now included in the comedy.
Humor seems to be directed at children more than it is directed at adults, and to me Johnny English’s mindless adventure is not as vivid and clear as the jokes of the silent Bean character in Atkinson’s films.
The basic premise is that the UK is now in a very serious situation.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated Britain's spy super-secret web site, revealing the identities of all British agents at work, and is saddened by the agent on duty. Unfortunately, small paper for Kevin Eldon.
That’s too much for a prime minister who has a pontifical and entrenched character, as he’s already losing political fame: Emma Thompson seems to be the best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the guide doesn’t help much.
His intelligence advisors say that he will have to recover someone who is in retirement, because all active spies are at risk.
And that means Johnny English can walk as well as he can. He’s now a teacher in a good place, but he’s giving out confidential schools about running as a covert operation: there are some nice jokes that English offers a spy academy like ‘School of Rock’.
They take English again to Whitehall to do an emergency information meeting, and he meets with Bough, who is his first member, again. Ben Miller plays that character again.
Bough is now married to a sea captain, and Vicki Pepperdine loses a little bit of a fortune in that style role.
So, in the Secret Service of Her Majesty's Secret Service, we're back in the Batman and Robin action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Ophelia Bulletova femme fatale.
Meanwhile, the tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the Great Britain's IT woes is seduced by the prime minister, Jason Volta, who is a dirty billionaire, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures of fate: disguised as a servant, they burn a French restaurant. They create chaos by hiding in the luxurious bed of Volta, and English reveals the complete anarchy of the real world when it comes to using the helmet of the real Volta.
All the stops look at the last sequence, but although it was pleasant and disturbing, it has a lot of children's TV.
It's so-so.
And as I’ve seen in other Johnny English films, I’ve been reminded of this: Can’t Rowan Atkinson give the British film industry a role that deserves his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to allow the British to work for four days but is preparing a plan to charge for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is looking at a radical plan that involves the British working for a week a day but predicting a five-day charge.
It seems that the leaders of the companies want to give workers what they have saved through the revolution of artificial intelligence, by giving them one more birthday.
The workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take the same salary home.
Sources have stated that the idea of 'entering well' is on the economic agenda of the party and that the country wants to put it on the workers' side.
Spending a four-week working week has received the protection of the Congress of Trade Unions, as a way for the changing economy of workers to emerge.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is anticipated to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to day, but a four-day week comes with the view that the party has to re-establish the economy on the part of the worker, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the party that defends such an idea, as the Green Party defended the four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, the aspiration has not yet received the protection of the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy, and the party does not take that for granted."
The shadow minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party’s congress last week to define his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said, without a doubt, that the power of 'faceless directors' and 'speculators' had to be removed from the public services offered by the companies.
On the planet of the shadow minister, moreover, the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their full participation, if they see that a labor government could suffer a misbehavior.
In addition, he noted that there were plans to introduce employees into the directors of the companies and create the Inclusive Funds of Property, to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, they could cover annual shifts of between <0xC2><0xA3>500 and <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 Minutes may or may not change the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation.
Brett Kavanaugh, on charges against Judge Kavanaugh, has postponed his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has questioned whether the results of the investigation could lead to a Republican senator's dismissal of his defense.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could do to change their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his counterpart in South Carolina.
"I think so," Kennedy said, "of course.
"When I said I was going to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, I called him, he was introduced to the allegation, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He answered with humility, clearly, without a doubt."
Graham's votes, however, appear to be written on the stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh and he would also be charged with causing an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it with all his tenderness," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those who spoke to him couldn’t verify that.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changed.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Day and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, a year-long music show that brings together extraordinary artists and has a mission of excellence: to eradicate poverty in the world.
This year, with its seventeenth edition, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to Central Park’s Grand Hall, not only to enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true purpose.
The Global Citizen Festival, created in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. This project is an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
If you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket to the event, those who want to go to the concert have to do a number of tasks or "actions", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or in some other form where it is useful.
But what success has Global Citizen achieved when it remains 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it an original idea to encourage people to ask for an action through a doo concert, or is it just another case of what is called "clickivism", that is, feeling that they are making a real change by signing a line request or sending a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, putting pressure on it to meet multiple goals.
According to him, world leaders have pushed for more than $37 billion in policies and commitments to announce these actions, and these policies and commitments will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or received.
According to the team’s calculations, the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children develop their full potential", which is based in the United Kingdom. Rwanda is ordered to give $ 35 million to the global economy in the wake of the disappearance of malnutrition 4.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizen like you, we will move into the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition at the London Public Library in April 2018.
In addition, the team said after more than 5,000 actions to improve the UK's health and nutrition of children, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project. Through this project, 5 million women and children will contribute to nutrition-related nutrition.
By answering these FAQ questions on their website, “What do you think we can do to eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great movements against civil rights and apartheid before us, we too will get stronger, even together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e, among others, will perform at this year’s New York City event. The event will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the U.S. Army to curb Russian energy exports as a "block" - Internal Affairs
"If necessary" Washington could use its military to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's relationship with Syria - notably because the legitimate government is operating there - is only an excuse to push back the new energy market.
"I think they want to negotiate with energy because they want to be in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern edge of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to manage that and interim.
"The United States, with our Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to block them as well, to ensure that their energy market does not reach," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the participants of an event organized by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, which is an event organized by a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
Washington compared relations with Russia and with Iran, making it clear that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic opportunity we have with regard to Iran and Russia is to take advantage of and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single-use" economy with a fossil fuel economy.
The Trump administration is encouraging the export of its natural gas to Europe and Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers, when it comes to a replacement mission.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, as well as US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, as this project makes Moscow "mistakes" in Trump's remarks.
Moscow has repeatedly underscored the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the previously existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, only to be an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s furious attitude towards the project is only influenced by economic reasons, and that the competition is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we agree that energy cannot be a pressure-making tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nova said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s attitude has been negative on Germany's part, and it has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organizations, the German Industry Federation, have asked the US not to enter into bilateral agreements between the EU and Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state is blocking our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), Angela Merkel's German chancellor and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "explore it often" to introduce the president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "explore" the president's presentation after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was in a hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he would examine the presentation.
"There is a time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government, and that demands that there be a woman upstairs," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will look closely at the presentation to the President."
Warren gave an opinion on Donald Trump in the court, stating that he was “taking the country on the wrong path.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has made it clear that Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, have been criticized.
In a statement released on Friday, Warren said: "It's clear we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
In any case, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don’t think he should be running for president in 2020.
The Massachusetts voter said the senators should not submit to the president, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, which is a "probable" minority.
Twenty-two of them appeared in front of the audience.
According to the investigation, Deval Patrick has greater protections to present the former governor, as he has defended a proposal for 38 per cent and appeared against 48 per cent.
Some of the other names that have appeared in the 2020 presidential election are Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide for January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the confusion of post-traumatic stress on Track Palin during Donald Trump’s election campaign
Track Palin, 26, gave it a year after entering Iraq in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because of what my son is suffering, because of what he is suffering when he is back, I feel identified with other families who are suffering from the consequences of the confusion of post-traumatic stress and the shocks that our soldiers bring upon their return," Trump said in a statement.
Palin said the arrest was "a notable account", and he said of his son and other veterans of the war that "some changes are coming back, they are coming back hard, the other soldiers they have and the members of the air force and all the other members of the army that they have left behind.
On Monday, they were arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman's home for violence at home and being poisoned by a statement that a gun was in possession, according to the Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, D.C. defend the impugnance of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are protecting the legal enforcement of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
A friendly statement was made by representatives of 18 states and districts on Friday to protect a Washington asylum seeker, challenging the police, NBC News said in a statement.
It has not been disclosed the full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union.
He said his spouses "and their gang members" had been sexually abused, but U.S. officials denied him a request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as creating a large number of U.S. asylum-seekers because they are countries with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who were fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
In a statement on Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said, "The new police are violating the state, federation and international law of the years."
“The federal law states that all asylum applications must be settled on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a bar violates that principle,” the amicus curiae said in a statement.
In addition, lawyers argued in the letter that the policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become activists and offer "the necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant more asylum to victims who were fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of being a member of a race, religion, nationality or a social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum itself has never been the solution to all the problems that people live in every day, even though there are serious problems.
Efforts to make a desperate rescue in Palu, while doubling the number of dead, are in the race to find the survivors.
For those who were alive, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It feels great," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who had a fever as she calmed her child down in the ruined city of Pau.
"He's bringing the ambulances every minute.
It's not clean."
The inhabitants have seen them return to their ruined homes, take their things from the water, try to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, destroyed by 7.5 earthquakes, have been overcrowded.
Some of the injured, Dwi Haris, for example, broke his back and shoulder, resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to constant reprisals.
His eyes fell on him, telling him how he felt when he was in the hotel room with his wife and daughter, the violent movement of the earthquake.
“There was no time to save our lives.
I think I'm stuck on the beach in the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard the wife asking for help, and then the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her.
I hope it will be good.”
U.S. ambassador to China says he 'attacks' with propaganda
BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese official newspaper promoted the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China after a four-page ad was posted in a U.S. newspaper in Beijing that the U.S. ambassador had used American press to spread his propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States of America mentioned in the second largest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa on Wednesday that he was trying to get into the U.S. congressional elections on November 6 after China was forced to flee to China.
On charges of wanting to enter the U.S. election in Beijing, Trump has branded what U.S. officials told Reuters; a new campaign in Washington was taking place to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in an upward trade war. During that war, each country has imposed sanctions on the other’s imports.
China's retaliatory pursuits, at the start of the trade war, were intended to attack exports from states such as Iowa that Trump's Republican Party was protected, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, one of the states that export the most agricultural sales to China, says Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, Branstad said, "China is now intensifying the attack by putting propaganda propaganda in our free press."
“By alienating propaganda, it is using a strong tradition of American press freedom and freedom of the press by placing advertisements paid by the Chinese government in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"However, at the press office here on Beijing Street, there is little dissenting voice and there is no real evidence of the different views that Chinese people may have regarding China's economic downturn, the media's control of the Chinese Communist Party," the statement said.
However, he added that "one of China's most well-known newspapers avoided an offer to publish its article", but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans reject women's suffrage ballots ahead of legislative elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts have warned.
Because many high-ranking Republicans are waiting and defend Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for Supreme Court, in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a downgrade, especially among women, in the next legislative stage.
The emotions around this subject have been very great, and most Republicans have been registered with the show that they want to continue with the budding.
These matters cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, said in a paper published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher has said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be able to calm down angry voters who are angry enough to support an FBI investigation.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and not even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national progressive group broadcaster MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Fool!" that they were protesting in front of the Senate, but Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's presence there.
"The willingness and motivation of the Democrats will be out of place," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People say it has already had a big impact; that’s true.
But it could still have a greater impact, especially among women and young people who do not have a fine vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, even if they don’t like the president often, they don’t give a vote.”
Even before Ford made a public statement against the Supreme Court candidate explaining the details of the sexual assault, analysts suggested that it might be a downfall if Republicans decided to proceed with re-election.
"It's become a great style for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, who left early this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not a matter of whether or not the committee should sit in the seat of the Kavanaugh defendants, it's a matter of how Republicans handle this issue and how women treat it," said Guy Cecil, a Democrat in the U.S. presidential election.
In any case, it seems that the Americans are quite divided at the time of deciding what they believe between Ford and Kavanaugh's location, but it seems that the majority of people are doing it for the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of those who participated believed in Ford collisions with certainty or certainty, and 35% believed in Kavanaugh, on the other hand, with certainty or certainty.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh said many or sure lies in his statement, and 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, Ford is investigating allegations made by the FBI at the moment, and at least one other prosecutor has also done what Deborah Ramirez has done, so to speak, the Guardian reports.
Last week, in a statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said that Kavanaugh had been drinking when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez has claimed that the Supreme Court's genitive candidates showed him that he was at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web has launched a new Internet that is designed to be used by Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to launch a startup that aims to tackle Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Free Software Solid platform.
Solid gives users the opportunity to choose where their data will be stored and which people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt's "taking the world by the wayside."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic one."
The app uses Solid’s technology to give people the opportunity to create their own “personal data warehouse” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists to make, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: they’re all available on a single drive, and with all of them.
The distinguishing feature of the personal data of the line is that it is entirely in the hands of the user who can reject the information of a certain type.
“The ability of people to access data,” the company says.
According to executive director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is this: to put the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
At the moment, these are the companies that make up: Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a community of developers and volunteers hired to work on the project.
From this week onwards, technology publishers around the world will be able to create their decentralized app using tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not "going to make a complete change to talking to Facebook and Google when their business models are completely changed from day to day.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to put in place an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the Internet World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been the voice of great influence in discussions about net neutrality.
At the time of its launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next time on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The First World War Victoria Cross has been given to the clergy
They married the only Church Church in England to receive the Victoria Cross as the First World War, in her hometown, 100 years later.
The venerable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a Frenchman died four days later, and he never knew that he had received the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the students, Michael Vann, said the stone was "very symbolic" to give the prize to his grandfather and show it to him 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin-go Canal "under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns".
Then he went to the first line of fire quickly, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward until he found a canoe alone and threw it into three lands to disembark.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew that his grandfather’s actions “could never have been done by him, but that seems to be a great humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a flower wreath after the parade, led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added "that it proves the courage of a true hero that many people will give him."
The MMA team waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they put Peppa Pig on it.
Let's say you wake up all night to see the people in Bellator 206, and then they won't let you watch the main session.
The San Jose cartels had 13 fights, six in the main calendar, and were broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom, on the Channel 5 chain.
At 6:00 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, when the British audience changed their cover to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised to wake up in the early hours of the morning to fight with him.
A follower described Twitter as a "bad-tasting joke" for children's cartoons on Twitter.
“A government law says that content was not appropriate until 6:00 a.m., and they had to be changed to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s chief marketing and communications officer, when asked about the grant.
"Peppa cherria, "yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that they will review the programme in the future to take into account UK audiences.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can probably fix a lot," Coker said.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there, and we can't fix that until it's our hour Sunday, Monday at their time.
But we are working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there was a pile of messages going back and forth, and they weren't all very pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I'm telling you next time it won't happen again.
We're going to put up five fights to six, just like we normally do, and we tried to offer people more, and we got our feet in.
It’s a situation that will happen.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's 'Little' Sex
Olympic racer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling a little bit on the other side because of sex, but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "that everyone was not like him" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs broadcast on Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said she had spoken to others about the rights of homosexuals.
In addition, he said that being a parent led him to give less importance to winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running program, has taken several months off due to illness.
After appearing completely lost on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "feel little" on everyone else's part because society did not accept the likes of boys and girls.
She said: "To this day, the feelings that make you feel little and different on the other side have been the real reasons for my ability and strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" because he didn't want to discourage people when he said he was aware of his sexuality.
The sport, which won two bronze medals at the Olympics, has become a high-profile promoter of LGTB, and has used the participation of more countries in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that homosexuality be decriminalized.
He said that he gave his opinion because he felt he was very lucky to be able to live in an open way without suffering the consequences and because he wanted to give others "desire."
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "he got caught by surprise".
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than himself, but he said there was no age difference between them.
He said, "When you were young and so many things were happening to you," at the age of 14, he went to the Olympics for the first time and died of cancer three years later, which makes it difficult for him to look for someone of the same age.
The couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said he had changed his "full view".
“If you asked me, ‘I have to win a gold medal,’ it was the only thing in my head,” he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than gold dominoes at the Olympics.
My gold medal is Robbie’s.”
Her son has the same name as his father Robert. He died in 2011 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to admit he was going to die, and he asked if it was one of the last things he wanted to do: see if he wanted to be in the first line of the 2012 London Games.
“I couldn’t have said, ‘You’re not going to be on the first line, Dad.’
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and he stopped breathing, and until he died I could not accept that he was not the same," he said.
The next day, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: putting myself in front of the audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
He also inspired his first song selection—Proud, Heather Small—to feel identified throughout the process of preparing for the Olympic Games and still put a little oil on it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, stayed in the chair on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will make the record on Sunday when he plays the 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his form to not look bad.
Mickelson was breaking the mark for the 12th time in the back event for two years; however, he sent Captain Jim Fury to the seat in Saturday's fourball and foursome modes.
To be in the middle of the action, as has often been the case for the United States, all five-time champions shared a day to be an animator on one side and to play on the field on the other side, with the hope of correcting them.
He was never the straightest driver, nor at the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best option for Le Golf National's competitive dynamics, as the toughest players are taking on the lost in the century.
And even if the field isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will have to face the champion Francesco Molinari at the British Open on Sunday in order to win four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood rookie.
If the Americans, at the start of 12 games under four, are a good start, Mickelson’s game could be absolutely decisive.
Fury showed confidence in his man, for he could not say much more.
"He understood very well the paper he had today, gave me a slap on the back, and told me he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a point-to-point sport and they've given these teams a tremendous boost in the past, and this week.
I don’t think I’ve seen two games.
I expected more, but it happened like this, and it seemed to us that we should play like this.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record as the player who played the most in the Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This may be the end of the Ryder Cup’s professional career that hasn’t returned to its individual marquee.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stopped seven times, however, according to Furyken, he has brought something that is unlucky to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny," he said.
"Young players have enjoyed playing against him a lot this week, and it's been fun to see.
He’s doing a lot more than playing.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows that the great advantage they have is that they can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, is expertly aware that although there has been a huge advantage in the last day's individual tournament, the Ryder Cup tournament can easily become a disastrous situation.
Valderraman made his Danish debut in 1997, where his team had a five-point lead against the U.S. under Seve Ballesteros, but they narrowly won the championship with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 points.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a big advantage if we won Valderraman and we lost in Brooklyn, and we lost in Brooklyn, but it was also a big advantage," said Bjorne (pictured), who won the 2018 class 5 and 3 on Friday 6th and 10th at the National.
So the stories tell us both me and all the team members that this is not over yet.
We're going to walk the whole walk tomorrow.
We’re going to go out and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are in the pile.
Our goal is to win the trophy, and that’s what we’re going to focus on.
As I’ve always said, I pay attention to the 12 players on our side, but we know well what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
In a difficult golf course, Bjorn said, "I never want to make any progress.
Tomorrow's tomorrow.
It’s time for tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s different to be with a member when things are going well, but, when you’re alone, every golfer needs to prove his or her full ability.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players: the best you can get out tomorrow.
Now, forget about your members, for they too must get their best out.”
Unlike Bjorn, the rest of the team's Jim Fury is confident that his players will play better than bank members, with the exception of Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury himself has been on both sides of these last-day changes of direction, as a member of the Brooklyn winning team, and later lost to the European team, when the Europeans made it a "Mediterranean miracle."
“I remember all the words I said,” he said, when he asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had encouraged players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the start, like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has an advantage, there is a lot of pressure to stay in those matches.
We have decided on this list of players and we are going to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas works to counteract this, and Rory McIlroy will star in the final match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter among other top Europeans.
“I chose this team in that order because they are the way to do the whole way,” Bjorn says of the selected individuals.
The construction of a new German army has been postponed.
The new German navy frigate had to be ordered in 2014, replacing the old Cold War-era warships, but it is not to be built until at least the following year, as the systems are more expensive and expensive and, according to the local media.
The demand for the Rhineland-Palatinate (Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a military newspaper.
The ship had to enter the Navy in 2014, but the following ten problems caused the ship to be able to carry out this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
Apparently, it will have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile features, and technology to perform covert actions (e.g. reduced radar, and infrasound and acoustic signatures).
In addition, it will also have longer maintenance capacities: the new frigates can be out of the original ports for up to two years.
However, there are constant setbacks, and the warring forces with cutting-edge technology (the Germans with the aim of projecting their capabilities) will remain obsolete for them to enter service, says Die Zeit newspaper.
The year that the F125's poorly finished frigates made a lot of noise in the communications, the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship after delivering it.
The reasons for the return are not known, but German media referred to "serious software and hardware errors"; as a result, it was said to be useful for use in combat missions.
Software errors were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by 120 marines, which is half of Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the vessels are too heavy and, as a result, their performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult for the navy to add new features in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz ship is a twin-class ship used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) is also a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,100 million, which could initially cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,200.
The problems with the new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "closing usable vessels".
As the representative said, the problem is getting bigger and bigger, as the old ships have not been replaced after they retired.
He also claimed that he did not enter the Baden-Wuerttemberg class.
The Secret Life of Sagittarius Is Watched by National Trust Organizations
A new study has been conducted in a Scottish Highlands area to find out how squids use the landscape to search for food.
They are in the process of obtaining more information about the behaviour of these particular birds, so that in the future they can better define the activities to protect them.
Research by scientists at the Scottish National Trust (NTS) will follow hundreds of common nanoparticles and sopranos, as well as the large-eared and Daubenton-based Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the essential locations, and the squid will follow the activities that will be carried out throughout the season.
Employees of the UK Health System (NHS) will also be able to perform mobile screenings with handheld detectors.
When the adepts perform sound analysis of all the recorders, they will know the frequency of the call of the saxophone, as well as what each species does.
Then, a map and report of the habitat will be made in order to obtain a detailed picture of the landscape-scale of the behavior of the lizard.
Rob Deware, who is an advisor to nature conservation in the NTS, believes that the most important habitat areas of the squid will be determined, as well as how each species uses them.
Thanks to this information, the advantages of habitat treatment will be determined; for example, the formation of ears, and how to maintain forests better for mammals and related species.
Even in Scotland, the population of the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain was marked by the decline.
They are at risk of construction and development, which causes them to die and they lose habitat.
Wind turbines and chimneys also pose a risk, as well as papers to catch fires, chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
The guards aren’t really blind.
However, as they usually hunt at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes, at the moment of swallowing the catches.
They use a sophisticated locator technique to summarise flight path zombies and octopuses.
The organisation is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of Scotland, and takes the hedges very seriously.
He has heard ten of them, who regularly perform observations, examinations of trees, and, sometimes, rescues.
In fact, the organisation has created the first and only conservation reserve in Scotland on the Dumfries and Galloway Threave land; there live eight of Scotland's ten conservation species.
According to David Thompson, the manager of the land, land is no better for them than land.
"We have an excellent field for the Thraven range," he said.
“We have old trees, and trees for many years; the habitat is very suitable.
However, there are still a lot of unknown things about mammals, so thanks to the work we do here and on other lands, we will understand what they need to be healthy.”
Thompson has stated that it is very important to verify that it is safe to do the maintenance work in the suburbs before doing any maintenance work; for if a single secret matter were to be disposed of, 400 safes could be killed, and perhaps the entire local population would disappear.
Sausages are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, hunt or harass them, as well as to destroy their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the representative of the organization for the protection of Saguazar, has asked for help from the general population.
“We still have a lot to learn about mammals, and we don’t know how many of the species that live with us are.”
Ronaldo has been acquitted of the rape charges, while his lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper.
The accusations of rape against him are "fake news", Cristiano Ronaldo said, and those who have done so only want to "get publicity" using his name.
Her lawyer, Der Spiegel, has published the indictment and is preparing to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
Portugal and Juventus have accused an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga of raping Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid him $375,000 in exchange for keeping the event quiet, as Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Shortly after the charges were dropped, he made a live video on Instagram for the 142 million followers of 33-year-old Ronaldo on the platform, where he said the charges were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no.
What we have said today is false news," said the footballer, who has won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
“They want to get publicity on behalf of me.
It's normal.
They want to get the celebrity to say my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I’m a happy man, and everything is fine,” said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s attorneys are preparing to sell Der Spiegel, which is said to be “unauthorized disclosures about suspicions that are affecting privacy.”
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will request damages "in the face of the seriousness of the shooting, which is one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino suite.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him, according to district court documents in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was placed on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "a good man at 99 in the morning", but that he "failed at one in the afternoon."
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sex, but that the relationship had been approved.
Mayorg also said he had called the police and had taken pictures of his injuries at the hospital, but later that he had reached an out-of-court settlement because he was "terrified by reprisals" and "concerned about being publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to drop the deal because it’s a suspected incident and she’s still traumatized.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and in the summer he went to a big Italian Juve team, due to a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of auto-makers
The UK will be "always sorry" to be the head of auto manufacturers after "Brexit", said business secretary Greg Clark.
He also said it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would halt production at the factory in Burnaston (around Derby) if the UK left the European Union without an agreement.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan's auto maker said delays in customs could lead to job losses as a result of a no-deal "Brexit" deal.
The factory in Burnston (which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars in the year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, our factory production will be halted," said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also stated that they are afraid because they do not know how the trade between the borders will work without an agreement from the European Union.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close its Mini factory after "Brexit" for months.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks surrounding the supply chain, if the "Brexit" is carried out without agreement.
Toyota's production line is "on time", and the parts arrive once every 37 minutes, both from UK and European Union suppliers, as requested for cars produced as soon as possible.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, the suspensions could occur at the borders and, as a result, delays and irregularities.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep an inventor for more than a day at the Derbyshire factory; as a result, production would have to be halted.
According to Clarke, Theresa May’s “Chequers” plan for future EU relations is “already designed to prevent these customs investigations.”
"It is necessary to have an agreement. We want the best agreement, not only to ensure current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"In addition to Toyota, some other manufacturers have proven that it is essential that the supply chains, which are very successful, continue to do so."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the suspension production will be, but in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the medium-sized factory and, as a result, the job would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the union unit factory, said that members are becoming more and more concerned: "I am confident that we will not recover these jobs if we lose them.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a detailed and credible plan for the future relationship of the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
A major meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "another week late" as the candidate for the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh's disputes with the White House go ahead, the White House said on Sunday.
Robert Mueller oversees the work of special counsel Rosenstein. The influence of Russia in the U.S. election, the link between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the alleged obstruction of justice by the president, Mueller is investigating.
Whether or not Trump has dismissed the replacement general tax and as a result put Mueller's independence at risk in recent months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered carrying a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from office pursuant to Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, where he would resign while the information was being sent out.
Instead, he said he would hold a meeting with Trump, who was currently at the United Nations in New York, on Thursday.
Trump has said he prefers not to dismiss Rosenstein, but has since postponed the meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid a dispute with the Senate Judiciary Committee; in that committee, Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, is a doctor.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, which led to a further delay in the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "It has not yet been set; it may be this week, but I would understand to delay another week, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We will see, however, that I always like to keep the press on top of the news.”
Some journalists will not agree with the statement, as Sanders has not given any press releases to the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why this was the case.
According to Sanders, the lack of press was not that television journalists are "majorities," but rather that he said, "I agree that they are majorities."
He then suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would be enhanced.
"A lot of the questions that the president has asked are more than the previous ones," he said, adding that without mentioning the evidence, "we have verified these statistics."
Sanders said the press will continue to do so, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that’s much better than asking me.
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've done it a lot in the last few weeks, and that's going to replace the press, when we give the president of the United States a chance to talk."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, when he participates in open sessions, or in the press that dignitaries visit.
He doesn’t usually have his own press.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the U.S. president this week in New York, when he made a spontaneous appearance in front of reporters gathered there and sometimes made a strange appearance.
The Secretary of Health of the United Kingdom has written a letter to the staff of the European Union working on the NHS in Scotland, stating that there are concerns about "Brexit".
The Health Secretary has written to the staff of the European Union working on the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the whole country and to ask them to stay there after Brexit.
A letter from the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, states that the UK has less than six months to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to take over the cost of the request for the "safety status" of citizens of the European Union who work in public services.
This is what Freeman said in his letter: "During the summer, negotiations on Brexit have taken place between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and a decision is expected for the autumn.
However, the UK government has stepped up preparations for a possible non-treaty exit.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate that I take very seriously the contribution of each employee, even though it is his nationality.
Members of the European Union, as well as those outside the European Union, bring useful experience and skills, and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home without a doubt, and we hope to stay with you.”
Christion Abercrombie has undergone surgery after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, an assistant coach for the Tennessee State Tigers, has been seriously injured in the head after losing to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31 and 27.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, said the player suffered a head injury a little earlier than the mid-game rest.
"He moved to the nearby airport and lost his county," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel have given oxygen to Abercrombie in the band, and in one episode they have taken a deeper medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team in Nashville (Tennessee) told WSMV's Chris Harris that he was out of surgery and that he was in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said, “They haven’t given any details about the motor injury or its severity yet,” and they’re trying to pinpoint when the injury occurred in the Tennessee State team.
He is in his second year with the Abercrombie elastic reds, and his first season after moving from Illinois to the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he had made a total of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher price for the tin when they buy groceries in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for the tin when they buy the bungalows in the UK, and this additional amount will be used to help those who are homeless, following the Conservative Party's plan.
Corbyn aims to neutralise the success it has had to attract young voters
In the UK, for those who do not pay taxes, there will be an increase in the tax on the tin.
According to Altsor Public, they will raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for the tin when they buy the bungalows in the UK, and it will be used to help those who are homeless, Theresa May said today.
Corbyn's goal is to neutralize the success that young voters have had in attracting; Corbyn has promised to pay more to those who have reasonable prices to give housing and to those who have the most income.
In the United Kingdom, the person who does not pay taxes and will be present will be the rise of the tax on the vine, and the amount collected by the government for efforts to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
In addition, which is an additional charge over the current grid (including the upper-level charge for the second houses entered two years ago and for the lease purchased for the lease), can reach up to three per cent.
According to Altsor Public, they will raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London-built skyscrapers are purchased by those who do not live in the UK; as a result, prices are rising and it is harder for those who want to buy for the first time to enter the housing market.
The rich areas of the country, especially the capitals, have become "mother towns" because foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the city.
Helping young people buy their first home, Boris Johnson comes after he has made a request to cut the tax on tin, namely, this new policy.
He urged large construction companies to keep the prices of the land unspoiled and unspoiled, and he asked May to leave a quota of reasonable prices for the UK's "residence crisis."
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced some attractive housing reforms; others, housing controls and "unreasonable" homelessness.
In addition, they want to give the municipality more capacity to build more housing.
May said: "I said last year that my presidency would be dedicated to the renewal of the British dream, that is, to improving the lives of every new generation.
This means that the housing market should be rehabilitated.
The doors of Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their lives.
However, for people who do not live in the UK and who work hard for the presence of foreigners, it is not easy to buy homes as easily as for British people.
For most people, the dream of owning a home is far from over, and we still have the dignity of those who need to sleep on the street."
Jack Ross: “To be the coach of the Scottish team is my greatest passion”
Jack Ross Sunderland's head coach once said he was the "greatest of his career" to coach a Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of setting up the Northeast club, which is in third place in League One, three points from the first position.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer, after St Mir's team returned to the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a League B trophy, and that was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was a kid, I saw Scottish matches with my father in Hampden, and I've always wanted to go back.
If I had the ability to manage the club, I would have only the opportunity.”
Former Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
As Alloa's head coach told Athletic, he didn't feel nervous coming after such big names; for Barnsley and Ipswich Town had refused to offer training.
“To measure success, I have to ask myself, ‘Can I go back to the Premier League?’
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should be in the Premier League, without a doubt," he said.
“It won’t be easy to get there, but I won’t see myself doing that if I don’t succeed.”
Ross spent only three years as a coach, at one time as an assistant to Dumbarton's boss, and after 15 months working as one of Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Allo get back down to the third level, and thanks to him, he went on to become the champion from being lucky to fall to St Mir's level in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turnaround for me, perhaps," he said of Alla's taking charge.
“I really thought being a coach was the best function for me, rather than being a player.
It’s strange to say that, because I was a good player, I made a good living, and I lived some important holidays.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to do a lot of things this week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of work, but I enjoy being a trainer.
I’ve always wanted to be a coach, and now that I’m doing that, I feel more comfortable in my skin than ever.”

Saturday's five and a half is a good time to take a drink, according to a survey
Thanks to the summer heat, there have been many surges in UK pub money, but the pressure has increased for the restaurant chain.
Sales of pubs and bars have risen by 2.7 per cent, but the restaurant has dropped by 4.8 per cent, according to data.
Peter Martin, who works at CGA's corporate advisory firm that collects data, said: "The past has been hitting steadily, and England's teams continue to think more of the World Cup than they think, but the July data are similar to June's, even if it's up to June's 2, if it's up in the air.
Even though the sales of restaurants in June dropped 1.8, they were even worse in July.
The pubs and bars specializing in drinks have also had much better yields, and the drop in the restaurant sales has been greater than their rise.
Pubs specializing in food have also suffered in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want to have a drink.
Sales of pub and bar drinks have risen by 6.6 per cent in the past month, while food sales have fallen by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results are a follow-up to what we’ve seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and social and sporting events are the most important factors related to the sale of foreign trade from home.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains have economic pressures, and a drop of 4.8 per cent in sales will cause significant damage from one year to the next, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The air is long and hot for those establishments that specialize in food at the wrong time, and it is to be seen whether the moderate temperatures that have been consumed will provide a calming effect."
The increase in pub and restaurant sales, including the most recently opened establishment, was 2.7 per cent in July, as the distribution of the chains softened.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index overlooks the sector’s sales of pubs, pubs and restaurants in the UK, collecting and analyzing the performance data of 47 operators. These operators’ teams, together, spend more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion on the sector’s resources.
One in five children have accounts that they hide from their parents on social media.
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts hidden from parents and teachers on social media, according to a survey.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, it was possible to see that “False Instagram accounts” have been uploaded.
The news is that whether or not the sexual content is being published has increased the fear of anyone.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “like” that parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts that they hide from adults on social media.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, it was possible to see that many “false Instagram accounts” have been uploaded (the photo-sharing website is Instagram).
This is because the news of whether the sexual content is being published has increased the fear of anyone.
Twenty per cent of the students say they have a clear "like" that parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website unwittingly, where a little girl said to others, "Get me out of here."
This study by UK Digital Awareness UK companies and independent schools (HMC) has revealed that there are two profiles of 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 years old, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s shocking that minors have the temptation to create the secrets of linear space that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'athlete' chairman' on the Scottish Athletics Committee
The former executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board has been appointed by Eilidh Doyle, this year's General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
The Scottish athlete is awarded Doyle, and director Ian Beattie has said that with this change they have an excellent opportunity to take advantage of the extensive experience he has had internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidhe has tremendous respect for Scotland, the UK and the global athletics community, and we know that it will be very useful for Scottish athletics to be on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m a big fan of being an athlete’s drafter, and I hope I’ll make a big contribution and send the sport to Scotland.”
The U.S. won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and has four gold medals in total. It is a BBC statement. A few days ago, he lost his ability to walk because of a past ischemic heart attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A few months ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me to see if I was going to improve or not, or to what extent.
It's been very hard, but I've completely upgraded. I've had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing skill training today!
Thank you so much for sending me the messages you sent me.”
An advertisement for a milkshake that compares mother to cows has generated conflicting opinions on the Internet
An anti-aging company has created conflicting opinions on the Internet, compared to the herds of bull-eaters.
Elvie, who works on consumer technology, has released a funny ad inspired by a music video, showing the freedom dreams of new devices that produce milk, to make a presentation of what is called "the world's first silent milk-absorbing device."
In fact, four women, who are mothers, dance in a corner full of sweat, with these words and a song of the like, "Yes, I'm angry with myself, but I'm not thirsty," and "Maybe you haven't noticed, but these aren't scratches, they're just my fingers."
“Take out the milk, take out the milk, give the babies, take out the milk, take out the milk, I’m feeding my girls.”
However, this announcement, published by the company on its Facebook page, has sparked a debate on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews, the videos have created a lot of reactions to the audience. Many have said that the "injury" of the dairy industry does not take it seriously.
“It was a very bad decision to use sheep to advertise this product.
“Like us, they also have to get pregnant and have to be half-naked to produce milk, but their mothers are stealing their babies for the next few days of their birth,” a user said.
Elvie's recovery can be entered discreetly in any breast to breastfeed (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said this: “It’s very traumatic, of course, for mom and mom.
But, well, why not use it to advertise a breast-feeding program that doesn't get rid of children?"
Another added: "This feature has no usefulness at all."
Others, however, have defended the ad. A woman has admitted that she thought of it as "a way of bursting with laughter."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still had one, I would buy one.
When I came out of the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but that’s what it’s all about.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny phenomenon, because milk-producing dreams (often have to be done in the workshops or in the bathroom) feel like 'sheep'."
He has no intention of blaming or judging the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they are carrying a breather out of the chest while dancing.
A lot of women who get milk out feel like they have cows on the campaign trail.
Elvie's recovery is completely silent, however, and has no cable or contents. It can be carried discreetly in one of the chest of drawers, moving as the women want, so that the babies can be in the arms or out on the street.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and executive director of Mother, commented: "Elvie is a very revolutionary product for recovery, and therefore she called for a bold and provocative presentation.
With this similarity between the milk-producing women and milk-breasts, we wanted to highlight the milk-producing process and all its challenges, and, at the same time, express the freedom of milk-producing in an entertaining and close manner.
It's not the first time Elvie's wake-up call has attracted attention.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrants have been taken to a refugee camp near the Texas border.
The number of children in detention has increased significantly in recent years, although the number of child emigrants at the border has been slightly higher than at the same level; one of the reasons for this is that the Trump administration’s rhetoric and hard-hitting guidelines have been harder for children to take on protection.
Up until now, undocumented immigrants have been the most protective of themselves, but now they are afraid to give a name to protect children, they may lose the ability to stay in the U.S.
The risk increased in June; for the federal authorities said that those who wanted to be a protector and other adults who lived in their homes should send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, one of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, admitted to Congress that dozens of people who had applied for protection of minors had been arrested without age.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them did not have a criminal record.
“Almost 80 per cent of the people who are or are living with them are illegal in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still tracking them," Albence said.
In order to process the situation of children more quickly, officials have created some new rules; according to them, the children must appear in court within a month after the arrest, and not in the first 60 days, in the words of the security personnel.
Many of them will appear in a videoconference through a call, asking an immigration judge to apply for legal status.
If it is decided that they are not eligible for assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in care centers, the more opportunity there is to increase their anxiety and depression; as a result, violent outbursts or attempts to escape could occur in the systems of security workers and in the last several months.
Child advocates say that these concerns are exacerbated in large facilities such as Tornillo, because, as it is so large, there is a greater likelihood of not seeing children's problems.
They also said that if children are taken to the campground to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, the trauma they already have can be exacerbated.
Syria has asked the US, France and Turkey for immediate withdrawal of the "Occupying Powers"
At the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Ministers Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are legally out of the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be "treated as a whole."
“They need to leave the country immediately and without any conditions,” he said.
Moualem said Syria's "war on terrorism is almost over"; 360,000 people have been killed in the war since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus has said it will "continue to fight in a sacred battle" "until we clear all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups, as well as from "illegally foreign presence".
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them against President Bashar al-Assad's Kurdish forces and working and advising Syrian Arabs.
France, on the other hand, has 1,000 soldiers on the land that destroyed the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are adequate conditions for them to return, and that he agreed to some "western countries" by spreading the "irrational silence" that drives the refugees to stay outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns possible," he said.
“They’re just politicizing everything.
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that they will not give aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have reached an agreement to create a protected area in the last stronghold in Idlib, thanks to which diplomats from the United Nations believe there is an opportunity to promote political dialogue.
The Russian-assisted Syrian forces in the province, which had a population of three million, avoided a large-scale attack that prevented the agreement between Russia and Turkey.
However, Moualem said the deal has "limited" clean agreements, and stated that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including Nusra-linked al-Qaida-linked fighters, who will "disappear".
Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new council will soon be held between the government and members of the opposition, to begin to form a post-war constitution, as well as to begin to pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set some conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this coalition, saying that the work of the coalition must be limited to "revising the current constitution's articles", and noting that no one else should be involved in the process.
Why Trump will win for the second time?
Following that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if, as many Democratic Party viewers are likely to expect, a no-charge process or scandals don’t end before his presidency is needed.
That would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency!”
For now, it doesn’t seem like the audience is tired.
Since 2014, the viewership of the most-watched CNN channel has nearly doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC chain tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers in that hour, i.e., it has risen 1.7 million since four years ago, according to Nielsen company data. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” session has the largest number of cable television viewers in the world, reaching an estimated 3.5 million viewers worldwide.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what’s going on,” says Neal Baer, director of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” session. After a half-chapter has been eliminated, Baer’s session is about a head of cabinet who becomes president.
Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory in his book, "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys."
Before the 2016 election, he was in a taxi in Boston.
The president said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because he said he was laughing," Scovell said.
There’s also a time for entertainment.
Of course, like nothing else on television, stories from Washington are about the future of abortion law, the families of immigrants can reunite, and they decide the health of the world economy.
Only high-privileged viewers have the option to disconnect.
However, if you spend more than six hours in the news, you’ll see a debate among experts on many of the issues: how Bob Woodward used the book “Fear” to write a “$15.000 horror” in the words of the Washington Post and the phrase “Daddy” in the words “Daddy” and “Daddy.”
At least I won’t look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, the executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of the "Pawn Stars" session, says this about the personality and changing arguments of Trump's performance (talking to the national football league, pointing to Kim Jong-un) about the "sense of giving a reality show".
You can't lose your temper, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleisse this week, she was doing 26 degrees and it was sunny at her home on the northern coast of Kauai, but she was inside while she was watching the MSNBC recording on CNN.
He could not dissuade himself from television, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that the future of the Supreme Court is looming.
“When I was doing these hilarious TV shows a long time ago, people said it was the end of Western civilization,” Fleisse told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Foreign money is entering the bar in the same midterm elections in the U.S. Congress
It is not surprising to know that money is entering the bar in Pennsylvania's 17th district; because the congressional districts have been reorganized, and as a result, two seats are being won in the competition to get the same seat.
The border has recently been re-arranged in that district around Pittsburgh by Democratic Party representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another district.
Another title is held by Republican-turned-politician Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is notable for its 17th district.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated against what the Constitution says, and that as a result of that court, the boundaries of the maps were delineated as needed.
This new district competition has had a strong impact on the competition for campaign finance in the main funding sources of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania because it won little in March for the special elections in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
He was a Republican in the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point margin.
In the words of the politicians, the Democrats have a little advantage.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for being on China’s side, but then rejects the decision
Diplomats have said the Dominican Republic and Panama have already qualified for Beijing, with Washington almost not asked to back down.
Trump had a meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and was the owner of a hotel in Panama, until partners decided to drop the Trump organization's management team.
U.S. Department of State officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following a "new decision to abandon Taiwan's sovereignty", the department's spokesman Heather Nauer said in a statement.
However, the sanctions were considered to be only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, among others, to control drug trafficking, promote development and help the economy.
Among the penalties proposed are the reduction of economic aid and the consequent reduction of subsidies, which would be very harmful to the country in Central America, as well as its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic sustainability, which was intended to be followed by a similar meeting held the previous year, and to allow immigrants to flee to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administration officials were forced to leave the conference clean, and thus, they were forced to hear that El Salvador had given up its consideration of imposing sanctions there.
President Mike Pence is expected to attend a conference that has changed the middle of October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
Three U.S. presidents have returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic in silence, without a harsh message or punishment.
A Bolton White House spokesman has refused to make a statement about the details of the debate by three U.S. officials. Among the officers were two diplomats, who agreed to give news of the nearby debates in exchange for maintaining anonymity.
An analyst who has a close relationship with the administration and has also spoken anonymously has confirmed what they have said.
Study history
Robert Mueller’s report will soon be dismissed, which will determine whether Trump has obstructed justice, as there is a lot of evidence of this in the public eye.
In addition, Mueller is also investigating whether he was a friend of Trump’s campaign in the U.S. election.
If the majority of Congress is reversed, Trump will have to give him the direction again, as he prepares to appear in front of voters (and, if necessary, at some point, a judge of his own caucus).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I do not mean that it is inevitable to go beyond Trump, not even the European equivalent of Trump.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and according to them will determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if the Western countries had resisted it and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We have failed, and we have lost the opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease in the following years.
With such points of inflection, we have a history of accelerating or delaying the necessary progress of democracy.
The U.S. is facing a number of such setbacks at the moment.
What are we going to do if Trump dismisses Rod Rosenstein's deputy general prosecutor, Roseinsten, who controls what happens with Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein’s job has been in jeopardy since the newspaper announced last year that it had suggested recording the president in silence, and that the president had declared himself unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is not correct.
"How will we respond to Brett Kavanaugh's full or partial investigation of the FBI's request for information, or if he receives a rebuttal to be a Supreme Court judge, even though he has been convicted of sexual assault and false testimony?"
And, in particular, will we vote in the mid-term elections to hold Trump accountable in order to form a Congress?
If we don’t pass those tests, we will be red for democracy.
However, I really think we will overcome them, based on the teachings I had in Prague.
Our mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied my embassy.
He came out alive, immigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he painted a swastika on a table asking me to light a Saturday candle.
With that heuristic, how can I not be good at looking to the future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels good in front of Rapid Vienna's fans
Rapid Vienna will host the Rangers on Thursday. If the Austrians win, a few weeks ago after the exciting match with Villarreal in Spain, they will stop at an unbeaten position to qualify for the G-Team of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans, who suffered a knee injury, was unable to make his first appearance of the season until his 2nd and 2nd equals with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a tranny to achieve better things.
"It was a good result, a good advantage for Villarreal," said the 31-year-old.
“We wanted to get something and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have been the winner in the end, but it's a result of equality, if need be.
In the first half they ruled, and in the second, we were the leaders.
Thursday night will be very important for the European Championship.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they have had a good result in the last match. However, the viewers are on our side, and I am on the move and will get a positive result.
It was a difficult year, I had injuries and there were changes at the club, but at the moment there is a positive turn.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying a lot; the training is also good.
I’m going to move forward, forget about the previous season and achieve success.”
Women are extremely concerned that they have a problem with their retirement savings, and that they have a problem with their retirement savings.
The survey participants know what kind of care they want to take, but very little has been given to their family members.
Half of those who participated in Nationwide’s research said they spoke to the couple about the cost of long-term care.
The 10th graders only talked about it with their children.
“We want a family member to wait for us, but we don’t dare to ask,” said Holly Snyder, president of the Nationwide Insurance Agency.
This is the first step.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: the family will not be ready to take care of you if you do not ask first.
When you work with a counselor and family to decide where and how you want to receive care, as these options will depend on the cost of care.
Ask a consultant for help: A consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term care, the other one: long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for care expenses in hand, and at the same time who can pay with their money, if you have money.
Clear the legal documents: Forget the legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health; at the same time, make sure that the professionals will take care of you as you wish if you are not able to ask for it.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person on your behalf to make financial choices and, when you are unable to do so, to ensure that you pay the invoices.
Don’t forget the details: let’s say the parents are old and one of them has a medical history and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications or allergies?
Write down these details so that you are ready for a written plan.
"Finance is at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Think about that too.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed on Friday due to the massive earthquake and tsunami that the Indonesian city of Palu suffered, and, according to officials, the death toll will rise.
Since communications systems are disconnected, sorospen agents have not been able to obtain information from the government of Donggala, an area near the epicenter of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in the north of the Pole.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here is some important information about the city of Palu and the government of Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi in the Middle East, and is located at the end of a narrow stretch of the western coast of the Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of around 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
The Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that covers more than 300 km (180 mi) of the north-western coast of the Sulawesi Islands.
The government, which is the administrative area of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the province of Sulawesi in the middle is based on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, but Morowalin concentrates mostly on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management), Paluk and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed, and hundreds of homes were destroyed in the Donggal earthquake.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred in the western part of the Danube, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismic field called the "Pacific Frisian War", which is why it often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake occurred off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami. This tsunami devastated 14 countries, and killed 226,000 across the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several violent earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed in Nias Irlan, near the Sumatran coast.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake occurred in the south of Java (the island with the most population in Indonesia), and caused a tsunami. The tsunami severely affected the south coast, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the southern province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on a Mentawai island near Sumtra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 meters. As a result, dozens of villages were destroyed, and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A small earthquake occurred in Aceh's Pidie Jaya government, bringing disaster and fear, as people remembered the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed in the blast.
2018: A number of large earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is known to tourists, and more than 500 people died, especially in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were left uninhabited for a time.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, born in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence case, for obstructing the prosecution of a domestic violence case and opposing the authority, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers Division.
According to a police report, when Palin started calling the police to report an alleged crime to a woman, he took off the phone.
According to KTUU, Mat-Su Pretrial Facility is located in Palin, in pre-trial detention and on a $500 trust.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he made the allegation, he said that he was "no doubt, innocent," as the network had informed him.
Palin was charged with three A-level felonies, and could receive a maximum prison sentence of one year and a sum of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor B-level felony, which could be punishable by one-day prison terms and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has committed a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was shot dead.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, domestic attacks, the arrest of a domestic violence criminal, and the possession of a weapon while intoxicated were reported.
As the girl said, he gave her a hug.
His son's attitude was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by Iraq's experiences, and Sarah Palin received harsh criticism in 2016.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication grids are being shut down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the middle of Sulawesi, which is the capital of Indonesia in the north-east of Jakarta.
There are several videos that show the moment of impatience on the social network.
In fact, it was a beach holiday in Palu, where hundreds of people were there when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Wants Special Death Penalty for Suspected New York Terrorist Attack
The New York federal prosecutor wants a death penalty for eight people who were killed for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack; the last time such a penalty for a federal crime was imposed in the state was in 1953.
It is believed that the 30-year-old Saipov used a rental truck at the Home Depot for the attack on the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, before he carried all the pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight of these people "intentionally" and seriously injured several people "intentionally" because of the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible to impose a death penalty in two cases.
A few weeks later, a large federal judge handed down 22 cases to Saipov, the other, eight counts of murder for organized crime, which the federal prosecutor used in organized crime cases, and a motor vehicle-driven and bio-powered vehicle.
As the prosecutor said, the attack must have been "premeditated and planned", Saipov had done it "cruelly"; he described it.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov's injuries, injuries and losses affected the family and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alenjandro".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
A decade has passed since New York's Southern District last condemned a death row case.
Khalid Barnes was then charged with the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were set up, in which two years earlier, during the Cold War, conspired to spy on the Soviet Union.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbek Saipov did not show any signs of involvement in the subsequent days and months of the attack.
The police said he did not feel bad about what he had done to the investigators.
According to the raid, Saipov told the authorities that he had seen videos of the ISIS organization on mobile for inspiration to carry out the attack.
In addition, according to the police, he asked them to put the flag of the ISIS organization in the hospital room.
As for the 22-year-old suspect, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders responsible for Saipov's replacement, said they had made "a big mistake" in their tax ruling.
“We believe that instead of accepting the death penalty for life imprisonment, instead of accepting the death penalty, decisions will only extend the trauma to those who have suffered the impact of these events,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked him not to ask the prosecutor for a death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has ordered the “mobilization of the people’s army” in protest at today’s Conservative Conference.
The leader of the UKIP party has said that politicians need to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, and Theresa May's MPs have proposed it to deal with EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told participants in Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom was "going to be out" as Farage was already the Brexit secretary.
But the remaining Conservatives have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, noting the challenge that Mrs. May is facing: to rekindle the completely divided lines.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to keep up with the plans of the compromise, but in the meantime he is dealing with attacks on Brexit, on the rest of the EU.
The Allies believe that it will move forward and that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels on the side of such reactions, and that it will force Eurosceptics and Labor to decide between its offer or "chaos".
Mr. Bone made it to Solihullen, explaining to the protestors of the Leave Means Leave group that he wants to "dismiss Chequers".
He also stated that he should work with Mr Farage and that he should be responsible for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If you're in charge, we'll be out already," he said.
The Wellingborough Party MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must dismiss the Chequers.”
In his own words, he said, "We did not fight in the world to be at the service of anyone.
We want to make our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone said in a 2016 vote that he had changed his mind: “The British have changed their minds and they want to stay is a lie.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and a member of the Brexit party, also went to the march and explained this to the press: "I only say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not known among the citizens, the opposition will not vote for them, it is not known among our parties, and it is not known amongst our activists who are stifling the streets and making it possible for us to win the elections.
Let the Chequers go and start listening.”
Addressing Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers, in order to continue their work, must keep their word.
Mr Farage told those who took part in the demonstration that politicians must be forced to "feel the heat" if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't let us out with them."
He added: “I want you to feel the warmth of our political class, which is betraying Brexit, and I want you to feel it.
“In Brexit, we are mobilizing the people’s army that has given us victory, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent and autonomous and proud.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through the city centre of Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration took place.
Few activists raised anti-Brexit cartels after the group’s lunch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, who is a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the fact that the Conservatives had security issues at the beginning with the party's application.
"These are the people we're talking about that ICT systems can function as they should, and in Ireland, the whole technology of the Canada plus plus chain, without friction, without borders, without free trade," he added.
"Lies are crazy.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren will look into the possibility of becoming president “with great attention”
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "explore" the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported that the Massachusetts Democrats had talked about their future at a full-blown rally in a Massachusetts-based municipality on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will be running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl; Diehl was the president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is said that Trump could take his place in 2020.
It was the 36th meeting that took place in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon since Trump took office and held a full municipal meeting with his members.
One of the participants asked him if he wanted to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that a woman must be in charge.
A suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting that killed Sims at the University of Louisiana.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that they had arrested a suspect on Friday for the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11:00 a.m.
Previously, he opened a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared there.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed on Friday morning near the southern university campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, and as a result, he was eventually killed," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the newspaper on Saturday via the 247sports network.
A friend of Wayde's got into a fight to defend him, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated, and admitted to being there, holding a gun in his hand, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department in the parish.
He grew up in almost two-meter Sims Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last 10 seasons, and played 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds, among others.
Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton won the world title thanks to the team's commands after winning Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear on Saturday that Valtteri Bottas would be dead or alive in the race if he raced ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From the beginning, Bottas was doing well, and almost threw Hamilton out in the first two seconds of defending his place, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first got into the boxing, and Hamilton had to get into the traffic at the end of the trooper, which would have had the right effect on the race.
Mercedes entered the box a little later, and came out behind Vettel, but, after a more normative, Hamilton took the lead; for, more or less, he freed the interior of Ferrari's driver, holding his position in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started the race on the last row of the exit grid, and finished in seventh place.
Subsequently, he remained in first place in a large part of the race, and, by the end, stopped the pneumatics to finish the race quickly and to advance to Kimi Raikkonen and gain fourth place.
In the end, he entered the boxing in 44, but was unable to survive the rhythm in eight seconds, and Raikkonen got fourth place.
It’s not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and he’s been really honest.
“The team has done a great job,” Hamilton said.
They were the ones who were disgruntled.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday, saying she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
When he spoke at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not make a direct reference to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate is "bad, false and false."
"The only thing that could have happened, and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days, that you see anger, that you see people who are angry, that you see people who are evil, false and lying," he said.
“You see the tunnels and the filtrations and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter the letter?
Do you remember her answer? Did you filter the letter? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we filter the letter? No, we didn’t filter it,” he added, imitating the senator’s reaction.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July explaining the details of Kavanaugh's allegations, and it was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claim; I didn’t filter out his story,” Feinstein told The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep quiet, and I kept quiet, as he asked."
But he was not welcome in the presence of the president, and he declared this on Saturday night at the rally: "What I'm going to tell you is that they were disgusting.
Maybe it wasn’t him, but they were the most despicable people I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with the defense of the Supreme Court’s nominee for the three women’s sexual access, the president said the Democrats are using the allegations for their purposes.
“They are ready to do something to restore power.
They are evil, they don’t care who they hurt, they need to spread power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars regained the game on Saturday against the Belfast Giants who lost the Elite League game, having won 5-3 in a second-round game at Dundee.
The Giants started winning, with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought about the same, but immediately regained control of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee back to the same level, and in the end, Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
The third defeat in the Elite League was for Adam Keefe, who lost 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener arrived in the fourth minute, 3:35 minutes, thanks to Kendall McFaull's help, and, four minutes later, David Rutherford helped Beauvillier, who doubled the score.
The start was live; for Sullivan brought the match in 13:10 minutes, Matt Marquardt helped Cownie and he scored in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer wanted to make sure that the Giants were on his side at the first break, and, at the end of the first part, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the houses were reassembled and Bouchard brought the equation back in the 27:37 minute goal.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen and give Dundee the lead for the first time, and in the end, the fifth goal and, together with him, brought the team victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home Friday's game against Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller has been killed by hundreds of flights from a plane that escaped from an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero when hundreds of passengers board a plane to make sure they have air and after they die.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Many strong replicas have taken place in the area, and many of them are caught under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great refused to resign his position and leave the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
At the same time, he stayed there to confirm the air condition of the Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, when he saw that it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, Indonesia’s air-navigator, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, as Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter in Balikpapan to take Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning, before the helicopter arrived at Palura.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear that," he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesian table to manage the pandemic says access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is thought that the rate will still grow, because many bodies are still under the rubble, and we have not been able to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Mayan governor.
Most of the six-meter waves have completely destroyed Palu; a massive eruption will take place there on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: “Minuture, a body-filled ambulance is coming.
It is pure gold.
“People are stealing all the food in the small market.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as fast as possible to help those who are out of work, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palura on Sunday and explained this to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
This year another earthquake struck Indonesia, which occurred in the city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared in a lake after the plane crash.
The airline that crashed in a Pacific lake in Micronesia says a man is now missing after 47 passengers and crew said the plane was being hijacked as needed.
Air Niugini said in a press release that he could not confirm that a male passenger was missing until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the passengers asking for more details (such as age or nationality) from the journalists.
Thanks to the ships of the place, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to rescue Chuuk from landing at the Icelandic airport after the plane fell into the water.
As the officers said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The impact of the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
According to the U.S. Air Force and Air Force, the plane crashed into the lake next to the runway.
Several witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
Bill Jaynes told the American traveler that the plane had entered very low.
“That’s a good thing,” Jaynes said.
As Jaynes said, he and some other passengers easily reached the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking in front of them in the water.
He said that he was afraid and was being silenced, and that he had suffered a small wound in his head.
According to the U.S. Army, the assistance of the fishermen in the improvement work around the dock was also very helpful in the rescue work; for this, a steamship was used to bring passengers to the ground before sinking 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, but none have been caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled a chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The case was dropped by the prosecutor on Saturday in a recent trial of a man who claims to have burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has been testing for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
When the judge introduced him, he used the mobile phone records of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers to track down the movements that killed the woman at night.
According to Rowlett, she received location data from a number of mobile phones showing that she was with Tellis Chambers at night, so she lied about Tellis's previous confirmation, according to The Clarion Ledger.
As the data showed, Tellis was with Chambers on his mobile phone when he said that Tellis was with his friend Michael Sanford; then the police attacked Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in the town that day.
When the prosecutor told Tellis that he was in Sanford's truck that night, when he asked if he was telling the truth, Sanford said that the truck was in Nashville.
There is another inconsistency: Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
According to mobile phone records, however, only a week ago they met each other.
As Rowlett said, after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from the phone.
"He's taken out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the final rounds.
According to the judge, the trial will be held on that day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
One of the three who make hip-hop music wants to challenge people who have a negative opinion about the genre of music, and for that they will fill their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed says he has left hip-hop music aside from his initial political messages and the fight against social problems.
They want to go back to their tracks, and get hip-hop consciousness to be known again.
Several artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen a resurgence of such hip-hop in the UK, for example, through Akala and Lowkey artists.
Another black one?
A New York child has accused a couple of throwing him away after a "racist" message
A New Yorker child accused a couple of discriminating against him and dismissing him as a result of an error and received a message from his mother that he was "another black woman".
The couple denied being racist, saying the allegation was “too much.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised to find out that the new child care worker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived home in 2016 at her first job.
"EEEEEE, BEST BELTZ BAT," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But when she had to send it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and in the
According to the New York Post, when he noticed that he was standing, Plasco-Flaxman was said to have felt "desirable", and fired Miss Maurice, his first child, who was an African-American, who was not a good worker and, instead, was expecting a Filipino child.
Ms. Maurice paid her only one day's work, and asked for an Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice has sued the couple, and the dismissal requires compensation for the damages caused, among other things, $350 a day for six months; for, and even without a contract, they were hired to live in the house for six months and take care of it at the beginning.
“I want to show that things like that are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied that he was a racist, and said that it was reasonable and necessary to dismiss Maurice, because they could not be afraid to trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife didn't send him anything.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you let your children be in the hands of a person whom you have betrayed, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby's birthday?
Don't even think about it."
Explaining that the rape was "not for the rest of the family", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the child for two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Are you going to look for someone with that attitude?
That’s not a good idea,” added the investment banker.
The legal case is still going on, and the public opinion tribunal has quickly accused the couple of being punished for their behavior and logic on social media.
The publisher of Paddington was afraid that he would like a bear that the reader would like to talk to, as a new letter has shown.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who accepted the book and was born shortly after, said of the writer: "It's hard to put it in the place of someone who read it for the first time before publishing it.
It’s really fun to know what Paddington’s great success is now.”
Her father was a cameraman on the BBC chain before he was inspired to write a children's book; her daughter said that her father had a good attitude towards people for dismissing her work, and added that the book's 60th-century illustrator "was a waste of time."
As for Paddington, he says he was "an important member of the family", and his father was ultimately proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, and he wasn’t proud,” he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he almost felt like a child who was getting something: you're proud of it, even if it wasn't your own achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success up and down.
Even though it was the creation of his image, Paddington always had the merit of admitting it to him.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As soon as he landed, his daughter was rushed to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, but the doctors could not do anything to save his life.
"It was very difficult for me to say that I called the magazine, that I didn't think it would come out," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"So, I got a call from Nad to say he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors gave the heart to follow the taupaka, and the drugs were being sold out, and they were leaving his system for a little while.
He died a little earlier than he thought, and ready, it was over.
I couldn’t just sit and wait, knowing it would all start there.
I couldn’t cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to hold it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was immediately saddened by the death of her daughter, went on board with the rest of the passengers, feeling forgotten.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I had my head lowered and the trees fell down all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane, I was angry with myself.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Some sad women put cards on a bridge to prevent people from doing the other on their own.
As a result of the suicide, two more women who have lost loved ones want to avoid taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a bridge in Wales; these cards have good messages and phone numbers, so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started having depression, and he killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney; she said her son had a special doughnut for the kitchen, and had a hearty smile.
“Everyone knew about the smile.
They always said that his smile was bright everywhere.”
However, he left work before he died, "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
This is what Mrs. Davis said: “I am very concerned that there will be a domino effect.”
Mrs. Davis created a few cartels, "Let people know that you can tell what is happening to you and be friends, even if you are a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she was also his partner for 15 years when Mark lost her mother and little by little.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
“A couple of days earlier than yesterday, we noticed that he changed his attitude.
On the day of Christmas, there was a knock on the door; when the children opened the presents, they didn’t even look at it.”
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they need to move on: "He leaves a quarter in the family.
The land leaves us.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake after FBI investigation begins
"What I thought: if he could get something like what he asked for, such as a time-limited or internal investigation, maybe we could get a little bit of a consensus," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the Committee would be "flawed."
Why didn't the FBI want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers to investigate the case?
The opposite is due to time.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections: they will be on November 6th. In these, Republicans are expected to achieve bad results, and, if so, they will start to be very weak for the man they want to elect for the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush made many phone calls to the senators, and put pressure on them to protect Mr. Kavanaugh; for Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was a Bush-like figure.
What will happen to the FBI after the report is made?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear that Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, President Mike Pence could break the equation and present it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees has "slowed down" since Kim was in power
The number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data from the South Korean Union Army, said there were 1,127 refugees in the previous year, compared to 2,706 refugees in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the establishment of greater silence for human traffickers has had a major impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
North Korea's refugees are offered to almost everyone the citizenship of South Korea sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 industrialists have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled into China; it has the longest border in North Korea, and it is easier to cross the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, which has a strong defensive force (DMZ).
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, rather than refugees, and is often forcibly evicted.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war, and relations between them have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that had been stalled.
Earlier in June, a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to a Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said he had not made any progress since the U.S. pulled out of the talks.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we won't have confidence in our national security either, and in that way we won't leave the weapons behind for the first time," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says she's "hysterical" to Brett Kavanaugh, and she's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of a number of minorities, says she is "hysterical" to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, and that she is not ready to be in the Supreme Court as far as the genre is concerned.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, she would say it was 'hysterical'," Pelosi said; that was on Thursday Kavanaugh's reaction to the testimony he had before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh denied that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had been sexually assaulted when both were minors.
In the opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and at times he almost started to cry and totello when talking about his family and youth.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats on the committee, and the allegations against him that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election are "organized and irritating" organized by liberals who are angry at the loss of the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he can't stand in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has a biased opinion against the Democrats.
"With these confirmations and the attitude he had against Clinton and the Democrats, he has stayed out of the league," he said.
Pelosi objectified Kavanaugh's choice and asked him whether he would oppose him if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this: If Congress or the FBI doesn’t tell the truth, then there’s no willingness to be in the Supreme Court or in the court that’s in the present moment,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is the Judge of the Court of Appeals for D.C. Circuit.
As Pelosi added, as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about the rulings he will make against the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he applies the conservative justice system.
In the re-examination court, Kavanaugh avoided the questions when he asked him if he would put back some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“A hysterical and impartial person can’t go to court and expect us to do well,” Pelosi said.
And women have to order.
It’s a simple speech; a month and a year of terrible anger, and it can’t be released without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s weird, do you?”
He went on to say, "A woman who was some sort of executor helped me terribly, and she told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique: when she was angry and started crying, I could tell her that I was talking to her.
But I'm angry."
And then, he continued on.
I thought it was a great idea.”
Malkos are not ill-seen to express anger, because they are misinterpreted to some extent.
I clearly remember something that happened to me in my first workshop. Most of them were men in an office. There, I was crying with anger once, and a younger woman came up to me from my neck. I was a little scared from the beginning. It was cold in my head.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you’re sad, and they’ll feel good because they understand you.”
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democratic member of the Colorado Legislature, and worked with Gary Hart in the presidential race.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business and his wife found out that he had a love affair with another woman and refused the race, Mrs. Schroeder decided to be the same candidate for the presidency.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "White Sands and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign began a long time ago, he was collecting money, so he decided not to enter the race until he had raised $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He knew that some of the followers who gave $1,000 to the men gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm discounted?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not make an official campaign, he was very shocked: he protected the good people, money and representatives instead of the voters made it difficult for him to gather the frustration of the system, and finally the anger of the sexist attitude.
"You would have thought I was very nervous," said Mrs. Schroeder, who had seen the print on her reaction.
"You'd think Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking this: what will they write in my notebook?
“Did he cry?”
The U.S.-China trade war could bring benefits to Beijing
The trade war between the U.S. and China was set to begin, and even if there is a life-threatening conflict, it could be long-term, experts say, to bring Beijing’s interests to fruition.
President Donald Trump threw his first warning at the beginning of the year; then, he imposed a tax on major products exported by China, among others, solar panels, ceilings and aluminum.
The most significant drop this week has come as new tariffs that will affect products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) will be applied to half of the sales to be shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has repeatedly applied reprisals on the matter, and the latest tariff hike between five and ten per cent has been for U.S. sales worth $60 billion.
China has said it will do the same for every U.S. increase, and the world’s second-strongest economy will not easily change that blink.
Asking Washington to step back would bring him to court, but publicly it would be more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to give his love to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, U.S. trade war prices could benefit China for the long term, which could reduce the fragility between the two economies.
“A quick decision by Washington or Beijing politicians could create conditions for economic peace in one of the two countries. That’s more dangerous than observers thought at first,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the U.S. Security Center in New Asia.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to return refugees who want to return voluntarily, and it is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country was improving.
"Today, the situation there is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the anti-terrorism process," he said.
The government continues to link the areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy as soon as possible.
Now, it is a good situation for refugees who want to return voluntarily to the country where they had to return to the country where terrorism and their daily lives and livelihoods had been difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime will be grateful for the help it has provided to rebuild the country that has been destroyed.
But he noted that he would not accept the conditions of aid, nor the aid of the countries that protected the poor.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
After winning the U.S. team by 10.5 points in the final, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf Nationale in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again carried the crown to the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn when he scored 14.5 points for the U.S. team.
Phil Mickelson of the United States had a bad time almost throughout the championship, and threw the exit-coil into the water in the 16th hole of the 3rd division; thus, he passed the spot to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer was well-known at all times, and in 1979 he became one of four players who had never achieved 5, 0 and 0 results since the start of the current format of the championship.
The American Jordan Spieth scored 5 and 4 and stayed out against the worst European team player: Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter, and reached the final of the Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, who took part in the Eighth Ryder Cup, became Spain's top European winner with 25.5 points.
“I normally don’t cry, but today I can’t avoid it.
It was a tough year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad to be back.
This is a team effort, and I am happy to be able to help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said, shocked by the victory of Europe and beyond.
John Ram passes the place to the Spanish, who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods in Sunday's split game (2 and 1).
“I’m very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing him,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost four games in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 results in the Ryder Cup.
Odd statistics, for one of the best players ever, who won 14 major titles, only over Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend looking for a bad situation to find a solution, except for players such as Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Fury, the U.S. captain, said of the team's bad game: "I'm proud of my boys; they've tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It's not going well.
Bejondeiola Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will meet again, I will work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Cup Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love my 12 boys and I am very proud to be their captain.
We have to accept failure.
We stayed out.”
