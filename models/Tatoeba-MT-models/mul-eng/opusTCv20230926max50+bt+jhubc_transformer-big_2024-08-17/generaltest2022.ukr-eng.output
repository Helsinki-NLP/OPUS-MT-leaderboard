Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people again went to the meeting, the Russians failed to break up
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Khersons managed to hold a rally before they arrived at the site to disperse the military RF with the equipment.
“We managed to hold a meeting. Now there is a rf technique,” said one of the participants of the event.
In the past, citizens traditionally gathered for protests in Svoboda Square - near the building of the ODA and the parliament.
This area is currently, like the building, controlled by the armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and steal people.
As reported, on April 3, the armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly conduct peaceful actions of protest against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against the people, is wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are stealing residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson a special title "City-hero".
On February 24, President Vladimir Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are firing and destroying key infrastructure facilities, mass shootings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, retaliatory fire systems and ballistic missiles are carried out.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the fighting in eastern Ukraine and, in particular, in Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
We fight, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we will have a weaker position.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (region) of the OSCE, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now depopulated.
They can go for it too.
Then already our situation in the talks will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory.”
Details: Zelenskyi also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose opportunities for a diplomatic solution if they are in us."
“People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end,” he said.
On our terms, conditions of independence of Ukraine, but ... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we don’t talk emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
And even where a million victims, it all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."

The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who took part in the execution of military crimes in the city of Bucha Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports about this on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 servicemen of the separate motorcycle brigade, who are directly involved in the execution of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha,” the statement said.
According to the MOU, for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will face trial and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were freed from Russian invaders.
In liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of civilians killed were removed from the territory of the Kiev region from the liberated Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are firing and destroying the key facilities of the infrastructure, carrying out mass shootings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, retaliatory fire systems, ballistic missiles.

I believe that I have learned from each situation for myself so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
The Directives shall be introduced in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be any problems with that.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate the same this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is there a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic?
In the beginning, you can try it for free
Maybe you'll write us a payment algorithm, we'll pay for it ourselves.

place, day and time will be specified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It was great , I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal cruelty from the civilian population in the north of Kiev.
Photographs of captured and shot people have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. It's exactly what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently assisting the Armed Forces and for a moment there was no doubt that in the case of occupation, Kiev’s forebears will not spare my family.
Because I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten Commune-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU gave a copy of the shooting case of the grandfather: the whole case more than a hundred pages, and the sentence of death is very simple and even more terrible.
The charges were unwritten, he denied the charges.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-door" nobleman, never walked in the citadel.
The fact that they lived on the farms and had several cows was enough to bring a cup and a diner of young children to the slaughter.
My parents didn’t even know about the funeral.
The grandmother said that at the time almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the striker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighbouring village.
I believe in genetics and I wouldn’t be surprised if his relative was a KDBist informant.
Apple from the apple is not far, as is known, falls...
The firing squad, which resulted in the loss of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia such as the "Immortal Barrack", which are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers – the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
It is as if files with child pornography were found on the computer, after which they were put in prison, and there he died quickly.
The KGBs are now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?
There is concentrated the most disgusting features of human nature.
On top of the millennial ordinal tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th century were imposed.
And then on top of what happened, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 semi-French film "Czechist", that's all.
You saw my picture in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Gale can't sign them
Anyway, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he is weekend and can go, because the car has not been seen at the station today).
It’s not easy for us to worry about you so much.
You are very helpful, thank you!!

I don’t know how in Europe, but in our country people get married for a variety of reasons, mostly for useful, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with that, if I don't love a man, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took her home and took her aunts right away.
She was so grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.

I am ashamed to sit without work.

Because that’s where all life is at stake right now.

As reported by "European Truth", Welt writes about this with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 trailers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offered swabs in the option on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relative to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the offer of KMW, the supply of self-propelled sleds will be carried out according to the circular scheme.
The Bundesver will provide Kiev with 100 of its hubs in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new hubs can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we'll find a way to fill in the blanks and fill in the blanks. I'll write you back. Thank you

Cat on her birthday is trying to end her life by suicide on the Charles Bridge
Have you been able to cope with someone?
So we wanted to solve the issue with the card until Easter.We do not have internet -banking,we do not know how to install it.What do we need to do?
To the Lord in whom do we live?
Say good-bye whenever you go.
Yeah, we can do it in 17 hours.
Can I wash my underwear in the apartment tomorrow and hang it in the garage?
Yes, I'll be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How much did you learn about this specialty?
If it was warm, it would be good.
I made an online application. I will try to leave after work today.
We are all well.With furnace heating,we have experience in Ukraine we have gas but since it is very expensive then we melted the furnace with wood
Good morning, Lena, show me where there's a shop nearby.
Tomorrow we go to Prague to look at the apartment
Everything was decided exactly.

The ex-husband can't calm down, the poems write to me ) a real drama).
How do I want everything that ties us officially to him to end up as soon as possible?
Thank you, because something doesn't come out of us.
And we even have a product of grasses
I'm sorry, but I'm confused.
I didn’t understand Czech so well.
I must have made up my mind.
It is true that they go to school so three because Galya and Sviatoslav learn remotely to finish school of Ukraine and receive certificates of completion already in the autumn they need to go to universities
Tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman themselves decide the issue in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It'll take some time before we're around.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to go?
Yes, I like to listen to jazz.
Thanks to this application I work with us on the Czech courses on Wednesday.
For the last four years, I’ve never let anyone down, I’ve read a lot of books on philosophy, and I’ve learned in myself.
When you’re in pain, it’s hard to trust.
But you have to try again, everyone goes through something that changes it forever, it's life.
Martin, we're already asleep.
Thank you for such a beautiful and fun day.
We liked it a lot.
We feel like we are in our own family.

Is there an improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people. If you can, help us. Find cheap housing.
We're in the blind now, we've been protected by friends for a while.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years, son 11 years.
The man has already found a driver's job.
I'm a massage therapist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school, and I could work, we need housing not far from civilization.
I just needed to give up today in the country!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even the big stores would be closed.

Make you happy, <0xE1><0x9E><0x9F><0xE1><0x9F><0xA2>.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm dealing with this so that we're together, that we're a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need to go through a survey on the manufacture of a food license. Can I do this for you?
Please tell us to prepare an apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
5th place I understand in the room with the TV?
Laying out and laying down a sofa?

Sorry that I answered so long, it was a working day, it was hard to adapt
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have such an opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how you feel.

Oleg is sick - sneezing and coughing. It is better not to take Jana with us, so that she does not become infected
Only I'll be a little later - somewhere around 8. Is it possible?
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything's going to be okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these escorts!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I’m talking about myself (for me it’s just a top not to touch)!
how do you feel today? <0xE1><0x9E><0x9F><0xE1><0x9F><0x86> after the celebration?
I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was upset that I and Cole had a bad start on the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonaszek))) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Is there anything I can do to help them?
If there is such an opportunity, I would like to extend the mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the Wheel in such a way that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test task.
We also hope very much for this.
She is very happy with any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met with the Ukrainian - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn’t stay away.
We agreed that we would be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
Branch in Hall No29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
I have ordered a spare card since.
No, I'm just a human being.
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I didn't go. Yes, I did. That's what I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the "common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to defend this foundation – it’s also part of our responsibility to our history.”
“If the evil demons of the past appear today in a new outfit,” he said, “then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight has to go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peaceful residents, starved the inhabitants of the cities blocked by it and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babiny Yar.
Over a month, Germans see this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak out against swastikas.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities. . . .
There is no easy way without risks and victims to overcome evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
I'll sing to you one night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected
All sick only Lydia did not sick in them was omicrone new species of covid

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians opposed joining NATO and only 18% of the respondents spoke "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s entry into NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite support for Ukraine’s entry into NATO and the assistance that NATO is carrying out in the conditions of the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and the members of the countries – for the timeless supply of weapons, refusal to close the skies.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Fucking Questions", together with the editor of "The European Truth", we talk about how exactly the Alliance helped Ukraine from the moment of the Russian invasion, what NATO should criticize, and why the Alliance criticize freely, and why our perpetuation
What do you think is here
In my volt partner indicated that my Statement is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile app.
There are no visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was issued in Poland, there the visas were not given, but given the pessimist.
We will definitely write to you!
Denise went in a good mood today.
He arranged with a boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet at the school, so that he would show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
'Cause I don't like it, I don't have enough time
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent to Ukraine T-72 tanks and infantry fighting machines
I leave the children themselves waiting there for 3-4 years and go home because I can not leave anymore.
And take with you for 6-7 years in the morning
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this person, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he phoned that he had had an operation on his heart.
When I asked him to talk to me, I felt sorry for him.
I have been psychologically supportive of him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at him in a different way.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
That is why God has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He speaks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find housing, and I am very happy <0xE2><0x98><0xBA> now have somewhere to live and have somewhere to be with a child.
Did I need to be reminded earlier?
After all, I helped watch the children in the family.

God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the price of unqualified work and I understand that such a job as I had at home in Kiev I will not be able to have here and the money that I made at home, I will not get here now either.
But just sit and do nothing I can not do, because then all the bad thoughts in the head lick so you need to do some physical

I don't remember the schedule.)
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "have never done this before"
Konashenkov: "We are looking forward to the attempts of diversions and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously abstained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of a full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which crashed the Ukrainian missile defense system, fell on a multi-apartment house in the capital Pozniak.
On February 26, the Russian missile hit a multi-surface on the prospectus of Valery Lobanovsky.
On March 1, the Russians entered the TV station at the Dorogojice near Babiny Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian defense systems crashed Russian missiles over the Southern Railway Station, which were flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14th, fragments of the broken rocket occupiers smashed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential massif in Vinogrador, from which one person died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets shot down the modern Retroville in Vinogrador, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again said on April 13 that residents of the capital, who had been evacuated from the city, were early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, in the surrounding capital, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that Russians are planning the first series of attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army regarding the civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia, an oil base exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod said that a "Ukrainian shell" had reportedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold pit from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelenskyy speaks not so much to them as to their constituents and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this exquisite fusion of strength, touch and sometimes relaxation, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden categorically opposed the closing of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are opposed to speeding up Ukraine’s entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we're crooks.
The money you collect is better to give back to people in need.
I can come to you and we will decide on the spot. I still want to help

I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we still have a room today? Or, as always, just go up and down?
So I'm already on my way and you're on the train
But I will not stop loving you, you are everything to me.

Thank you very much for your invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!

Can we get there tomorrow, find out the conditions?
My name is Sasha and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in the field of neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian and Czech, and I am learning intensively.
Contact: ------ I would also like a letter, so that Czechs can write to you through the translator, SMS does not go here, they do not have Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, do not agree.
You really don't want that price?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a price list, I won't deliver it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today, for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely, today I ask only for attention.
I want to say a lot today, so I ask for more patience.
Are you all right with the idea?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy the dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t accept that.
He’s stuck with the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as something is clear.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now... let's make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got 50 bucks in my pocket, everything we've spent at home.
To many, we find leaders who have not paid a salary for our work.
Where do I go ?? Who do I need ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You don't have to be able to take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house for a thousand miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What next ? Unknown. How much so ? Unknown. Children ask for sweets. And you can not . It is expensive for you.
And from every inch of it, we don't have that.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children at risk, or try to save themselves here
She was very happy with the hearts and the things that the children gave her when she came to school.
I needed to call you when you were here.
I’ll write to you at dinner.
I believe in God and I believe in Him.
I no longer have the strength to do it all.

If so, what type, I see.
Please send a page with a visa or an entry stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libuche, did you pay the rent?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing so much good to us...
We are in great debt to you...thank you!
Yes, I understand that this is very good.
Now I'll show you a photo of the lady's card, which I'm learning English.
Well, what you write tomorrow, see you tomorrow or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning.We have enough resources.It would be very good to know a person from Ukraine
If you want, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week?
Carina brought us the medicine the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with lying patients and children with disabilities.
But it is necessary to indicate that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
Can I wash your laundry soap?
Because there is only anti-bacterial gel
I won't say for sure, because I'm not very oriented in the city yet..about half a dozen
What services/activities do you think are needed/absent for older people?
I don't know because there was no text message from the bank and I didn't take the bank cards yet and the children removed the bank application so they very upset me
then write to me please, how are you going to go <0xE6><0xAD><0x9F><0xE8><0x99><0x8F> <0xE6><0xAD><0x9F><0xE8><0x8F><0xBB>
Today we have the joy - our city of Bucha freed from the occupiers , our armies staggered .
There is a clearing from the enemy - looking for Russians on basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the work of demining will begin.
And John would have looked, maybe something there needs to be repaired or something else to be done.
Diana, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our master wants to stay at home, says he is tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll bake a doughnut and do the lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs, who in their premises and shops opened up the volunteer staffs.
These are tractors that actually go into the field under the shells, because it is time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who today agree to go in rubber convoys in the temporarily occupied territories to take help there and get people out of there.
These heroic leaders, who without fear go to the zone of hostilities, calm down and help the refugees in the wagons, and on the peaceful stations help the volunteers to carry the humanitarian into the wagons.
These were the car fuelers who stood on the Zhytomyr route in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and upset people.
It is the Communalists who, under the shells, export garbage, repair pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses, who rescue people 24 hours a day, without complaining, and in their spare time will still volunteer, collecting drugs on the front.

My daughter is 8 years old, that age is acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for us with a daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports to get a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and do not work online.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far, a lot of time takes a road train, the child will be difficult.
Therefore, I decided to search for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, we're all set.
Yesterday's devices where to put
But I can't change my password when I go over the link, because it gives me this error:
It's in the microwave, something was burning there.
In Ukraine, the operators of the largest banks are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day and promptly all issues are resolved :)
Nothing to get used to in the new reality.
I am very uncomfortable and I want you to know that.

Local elections are not held at the behest.

Very tasty apples, what kind is this?
The head of the office of President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” with regard to the weapons handed over to us by our allies.
Yermak: "They understand that they will lose the war, see their backwardness and seek to "beat" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of the S-300 transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scripts of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers give up arms against the allies, and it is massively turning to the armaments of the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you of such fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Excuse me, I forgot to ask how much the bulbs cost a gardener a month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the appearance of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation”.
“The news of the killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian peaceful residents is worthy of condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumiyo Kisida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
The statements were heard after the appearance of reports that hundreds of peaceful residents were shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in the suburb of Kyiv, in Bucha by Russian troops, who left the area after the occupation for several hours.
The photographs, which allegedly depict the bodies of civilians killed with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the culprits.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said Russian troops could go so far as to have committed a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything we can to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not remain unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Buchi is "another staging of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia’s Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an “investigation” on charges of spreading “consciously false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of carrying out “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” Zelensky said in a video interview, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these killings, for these tortures... For being shot in the back,” he said.
He said that the President of Russia Volodymyr Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of the victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Svoboda on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city of bodies like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buchi.
The bodies of a group of nine people – all civilian – were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything from the list.
"They were told: Kiev is not there". How the occupants of the floor exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another point, about which there is much less information at the moment – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About mid-March, Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military police.
"Ukrainian truth" searched for Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the inevitability.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict pressure.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second boarding house, took out from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslav, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine from the swimming of Josip Zaczepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr got a job at Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
Like the real plastuns, Denis and Marina had previously collected alarming bags, but on the morning of February 24 did not manage to evacuate.
They didn’t have their own car, and the suburban buses didn’t take anyone anymore.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, following which the first shells flew.
One of them was in the neighboring house.
Then the family went down into the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basements.
Not everyone decided to drive.
“On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came to the entrance, who spoke not in Russian, and not in Ukrainian.
They ask, "Is there anyone?" - I say yes. - "Get out!".
They searched for me, asked who was in the basement, whether there was a gun.
All the men were asked if they were in the army.
The women were told, “We have come to protect you under the command of Ramzan Kadyrov.”
It was a Chechen OMON, not even a military, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said: “We were helped by the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Biliy (commanded by the unit of the nationalist UN-UNSO “Viking” movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war – UP), now we have helped you to win.
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all equally the Russians will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video online where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So after robbing the store, they brought a sausage and they say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one wanted to say anything, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give up our phones” – they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it is that they came, because they did not want the war, the Ukrainians support and the general good: "Putin is a product, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing, because there are our families."
And mostly they didn't fight, they went to grab the shops, they ran errands.
The chicken was brought, one tied to one leg of the Georgian ribbon, and the other to its white scotch and called it "half-scotch".
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "What, do you have an artillery?"
Moreover, we had organized troops – Chechens did not know each other, in the first days asked for passwords to identify theirs or others.
They were in us until March 13, after which came the Russian OMON, and behind them is the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between houses – ours constantly got into it from the "Bayraktariv".
But these came and told us that the USSR no longer exists, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" about 100 thousand in Ukraine.
Narrative "Kyiv has already given up" has been going on since the beginning of March.
Someone came to us one day, a Russian – either an officer of the landing, or a representative of the FSB – and said there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe the “green corridor” was given to us.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "That's a pity for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they dragged us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either "Cities", or mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct entrance on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The party did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland – he said, “you will be shot there, the organs will be sold”.
We were lucky through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were heating, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians are immediately exporting the equipment to them.
A lot of copons, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint of the "Komar" we passed the improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A missile is fired, and apparently a trace – it worked "Iskander" on Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: “No, these planes fly, they disperse on the border.”
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Next we were taken to the bus and lucky in the sanatorium "Chonka" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Look, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they get these thieves.
The poor people are suffering.
And Lukashenko is so good!
As he says, it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one shot.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they were so called) spread disinformation that men in Poland can’t go.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate, we were not helped at all, and in Minsk at the station, they said that without passports, no one would take anyone to the bus.
I would like to say that the Belarusian volunteers were very helpful to us.
We were moved to Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
The sanatorium did not hold power.
Our second group of migrants said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no pay here.
We found an internal transporter who decided to take us to Warsaw.
While driving near Mozir (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – U.P.), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the missile first flies out, shines beautifully, and then fires.
People who were sitting on the bus in Mozir said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the poles.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, does not believe at all.
They say, “We are a people of peace.”
They do not perceive that their polygons are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, there were friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through the registration, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now, certainly, as much as the Estonian flags.”
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Gostomel along with her brother’s family – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she phoned her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle could not – there is no house anymore.
No one knew anything about the evacuation at all.
You can't go anywhere in the city on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything.A guest is always waiting for you!

On April 1, the mayor of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk announced the glad news – Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this point was clouded by fear and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in one Bouchy alone, the Russians shot at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed just on the street, someone tied their hands and shot in the back, some of the killed - minors.
The victims and traces of torture found the village of Motizhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the fraternal grave, Igor – in the sewer.
On the side of the tracks 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several dressed women, wrapped in a blanket, were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home.

She is very inattentive and somewhat irresponsible.
Then stop your pass, then the phone will forget or how now does not take the phone and did not write to me that in school and that everything is ok :)
And I'm worried about her, because she's still not at home, but in another, not quite a familiar state.
I hope I found the maths right.
You didn't think I was a kid.
Of course, the work is also interesting.
However, if not very physically cool, because I do not have such a good physical form
I could pay a reasonable price for the house if someone gave me a room.
You’re communicating a lot, you’ll probably know someone.
Good day, so very interesting work, but we do not speak Czech
Who can we give things to follow?
The Charitable Organization of the Archdiocese of Karitas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians who are in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.
You imagine, the Russians are raping women, their children are forced to watch it.
Then they can still rape, humiliate the body, and all this is seen by children.
Good morning, I'm talking to you - you need to learn the Czech language, and I can't separate from the news.
I communicate with you very often in thought. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment, it's done late.
So what, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, that is really the case.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked about the fact that it was enough weapons received by Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would look different.
“It would have spread differently, we would have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure the war wouldn't have happened anyway," he added.
Recall, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has promised Ukraine a new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and back home.
Write to me about everything you need, please.
I wanted to ask you maybe you know where we got a blender in the kitchen

You come to the town hall, and at the bottom of the reception you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovska, if you are not given the way and the number of the door to her.

If you can't make a deal, call Dominic, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzhkovska is not coming yet, wait a minute for her, she said that before she has a meeting, then maybe she will be a little late, but she knows about you, ordered you for this 9th hour just to get to the doctor.

He was a very rich man, after a while he called and told him that he had had an operation on his heart.
When he asked me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I could be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
“I had a car in my yard, it looked like a crocodile, and I let the trees down.

“I’m telling her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio receiver’ has been delayed due to import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to panic when they make a phone call.”
"We've been hiding from the superstitious info about the war for a whole month.
So far it's working.
However, in Flea (cat – UP) on the pus and hind legs, it is painful – it can be from stress, changes in food and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are gone, but here the stress is not up to me, unfortunately.
The flag, unlike the viceroy, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions.”
Thanks to Olga’s poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her niece lived in an apartment with her “incognito”.
On April 1, the 93-year-old Oksana Polov took up arms for the first time in her life.
“For 33 days I, as a Partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was next to her – formally came as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then she sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always on the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
It sounds bad – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her "walkers", I was hiding in my room.
First of all, she hid a receiver and a TV from her.
Then I called everyone who spoke to her. It's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
April 17th - I have 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it. :)

I'm telling you the embassy's just here,
The Britishman, who defended Mariupol in the lava of the Armed Forces, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Britishman, who is a serviceman of the brigade of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who takes part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a British who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke to him
Aislin tweeted: “We received a message from him: ‘It’s been 48 days, we tried everything we could to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We don’t have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces, which takes part in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of a soldier, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone call, Eislin had spoken about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade had finished ammunition and food.
The journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Eislin units are going to go into captivity to the Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets at the hands of the so-called “cadirvos”.
There was also an audio recording of a phone call on social media, on which Eislin allegedly talks to his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Vagner on Instagram.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the fighting against the terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the lions of the Armed Forces and took an oath.
Eisla's friends and family were called Johnny, and on social media he is better known as the Nickname Cossack Gundi.

The family is fine, I have my mother, three brothers and a husband.
One brother for the war in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhzhia and the man today from Kiev were transferred to Kharkiv.
Phone calls every day say it's okay, and there's someone who knows it, they won't tell the truth anyway
I wanted to talk to you, but I wanted to do some things.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I would need to talk to Daniel.
Attackers-multiplayers for their losses in the battle played out in full.
The teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unknown in the name of his relative, the young Boris Oleksiyenko, was shot.
Their bodies are thrown into “a deep pit that has been swallowed up by the earth.”
“There was a dead silence in the city.”
Rarely did one of the residents run away from home to home.
On the streets, there were always bodies of people trapped by Bolsheviks.
And I might actually go after you, and I need you, and I can't do without you.
3. Which of your own activities/activities would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you will not come, because here the reconstruction of the railway and the entrance is closed.

We'll try to take us Tuesday to the social service.
Then, when the filling is cooled, and the dough will fit, glue the pieces and heat them on a small fire on the oil.
Okay, I'll have to ask him.
As soon as we get dressed tomorrow night, I'll pick him up and Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go this way for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed draft law 7176, which is entitled “On the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine’s national security in the sphere of economy”.
It is strange that the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the field of economy has been... a place where members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in the conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any company in which there was a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable – this is a great basis for “removing” all the skills in the difficult reform of state enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
It was what it was until 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill “land,” then tomorrow others can land – for example, you can cancel the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There is a lot to write about the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of Bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to dissolve the supervisory board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular voters for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will understand the arguments that explained the necessity of its adoption.
And then we will give our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for remote supervisory boards to work.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the Supervisory Board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in terms of what can be paralyzed the work of the company.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let’s imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) provide their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the bill 7176 will most likely not be able to save from the loss of the supervisory board the opportunity to make a decision, and rather, it will lead to this!
The MP, the author of the bill Dmytro Nataluh, provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPC), are now in need of relocations” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information”.
To begin with, in Ukraine, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the OPC, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in the "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the OPC.
But even in Ukroboronpromi, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties on a non-free basis.
All the power in the "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the Director General, who will, by the way, make a decision on the necessity of relocation of one or another enterprise of the OPC, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not hold up criticism yet because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state enterprises of the OPC.
Mr Dmytro, on his Facebook page, also cites arguments that can be attributed to the category of “emotional”.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the state-owned companies and state banks, but let us try to understand some of them: "respectful experts-foreigner with the first word "war", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but
First, it is manipulation – most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people also have a different occupation, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these claims are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is by no means the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Welcome. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary protection in the family. With me 2 children.

We usually need a passport for one of the adults.
In Brovarsk, Vyshgorod and Buchansk districts of Kyiv region, which have been liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a strengthened command hour for 2 days.
In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the Commandant hour is strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages the restrictions will be in effect from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the district, at this time it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during the alarm signal to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and mine the territory.
Omelyanyuk called on people who had left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the territory of Kyivschyna, the command hour will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
Neither of the schools have sent anything to me yet, I only have a receipt for payment

Lukashenko's regime forces detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signalling plant under Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyo Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennadiy Kazakevich, quoted by state information agency "BelTA"
The Belarusian Interior Ministry said that on the night of 30 March, three residents of Bobruysk were detained, one of them injured, with the support of special-purpose “SOBR” special-purpose agents.
According to Vyasny, while detained, the men made active resistance and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Interior of Belarus Gennadiy Kazakevich said that "the acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by the armed forces.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch "BZD" and the administrator of the thematic resources "BZD" in "VKontaktie and "Odnoklassnykh" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for the diversion.
The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions at the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Promoga" plan.
The Belarusian “reich partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is moving to fight, in Ukraine live strength and technology.

U.S. Bans Investment in Russia and Sanctions Against Putin's Daughter
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, will impose new sanctions against the daughter of President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also ban all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, which is owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and will prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was the restriction against large Russian state enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and will freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Minfins will be released the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex-president and the Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister
Sanctions exclude them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There's a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and well.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenz, he conducts scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron bonds.
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the TV channel "1+1", published a video on the morning of April 12, which was transmitted to her by the military 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to take part in the fighting, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "The bill goes on for hours."
Prior to this, on April 11, the 36th separate Marine Brigade, which takes part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not connect with the fighters for two weeks.
In the social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in the Russian language.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "Azovstal" plant in Mariupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletskyi, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the "Azovstal" plant, which are held by the fighters of the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good

Two Transcarpathian and two Czech “birds” brothers were sent to Ukraine on the eve of yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shthur, delivered drones for the purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in three different cities, dede.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of choppers - the location of them is currently left in a secret.
Four friends, who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic on the done stop, do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and the preservation of life.

Staff building: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against the neighboring state”.
“It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state.”
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobo<0xC5><0xBE>an direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to carry out the preparation and dispatch of personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent dislocation of the 60th separate motorcycle brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the restoration of the loss of personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorcycle brigade (Borzia, Zabaykalsky Krai) 29 General Military Army of the Eastern Military District is carried out a selection of military service
The special problem of the enemy is felt when completing the positions of drivers and mechanic-drivers.
The arrival of the selected personnel from the point of permanent dislocation is planned for the second half of April of this year.
Probably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of conduct of hostilities, will continue the strikes on the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or put them out of order.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhan direction, separate units of the 6th General Military Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is ongoing in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the opponent uses BPLA "Orlan-10".
By force to two battalion tactical groups of enemies tried to carry out an attack in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenyka and Dmitrovka, had no success and departed for previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy’s main efforts continue to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobahmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out storm actions in the area of Golden, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue the assault operations in the areas of the factory "Azovstal" and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shelling of positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopil, Trudolyubyka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, four enemy attacks were repelled by the defenders of Ukraine in the last day, five tanks, eight armored units, six automotive units and eight enemy artillery systems were destroyed.

Friends are long and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
There have been difficult times for you too.
Over the past month, I’ve talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from one leg to the head, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
A lot of you are from Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilt and shame because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is submitted on your behalf.
Some of you, the activists, have long been in danger, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very longtime friend of the Memorial.
Let’s talk a little later, – as usual, laconicly replied Sasha. – Now after the search we go to the ruins.
Others – culture activists, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
No one likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked in the “Memorial”, in the “New Newspaper”, in the “Echo of Moscow”, in the “Middle”, in Navalny’s organization and in a number of other places – did many of you at least do something about it?
Except that they participated in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also column of the Russian newspaper "It's too late to hide, it's too late to shut up"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive composure, which now, surely, have put a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That's not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had to a certain extent freedom and democracy – disordered, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year of 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally covered with such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he didn't kill, you still think it's safer around him.
In fact, mistakes have been made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the staff, you took the soul to the monument of Dzerzhinsky – and allowed the KGB to sink, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were put before the choice between the plunder of the country and the return of the communists, you did not begin to fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly reconciled with the plunder.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed their eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of peaceful residents, of murdered children, of soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was upset: “Friends, this is not my Chechen, this is your Chechen.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
It’s your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of zero, due to rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you started to earn well, some got rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, isn’t that bad?
Moscow was celebrating and shivering from the neck.
When several opposition members were killed – Yuri Shchekochikhina, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and horrified about what was happening.
However, it didn't go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev and took the place of the prime minister himself, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or silenced it.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the suburbs of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country has been occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West have done much if we have done anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is blatantly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the tough 1990s, that was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin changed places with Medvedev again and planted the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to mass protests.
The name of Navalny became provocateur, you did not walk out of the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
He then hit back in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands of people were behind bars.
Some have had a lot of deadlines.
“What could we do?”
I’ve heard it so often and I’ve heard it so far.
“The country is so strong and we are so weak.”
Look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president, who thwarted their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan – and never left it again.
They set up a tented town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, fixtures and cocktails of Molotov.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went on to attack.
A lot of people died, but they won.
Yanukovych has become a fugitive, and Ukrainians have restored democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and expel them if they do their business badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general suspicion, he seized the Crimea.
Some of you have been against it, but there is little benefit from it.
How many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
From somewhere a new myth was born, and many of you, who despised Putin and his chess, suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to admire him.
It’s hard for me to find a reason, because right after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who stayed with my friends were mostly silent.
“We’re not interested in politics,” he said.
And you hid the new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, almost as new after the restoration, which Moscow’s measures started in 2012, – with their binbegs, a publicly available waifa and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it’s only getting better.
You have just been paying attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
ISIS or something there... Even the Moscow editor, who released my book on Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I didn’t quite understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw myself, on the streets of Homs, state snipers shooting in cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of peaceful residents, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I spoke – because I’m not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I spoke – because I am not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything about my defense.”
How many of you spoke about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
The vast majority, however, spoke.
Some people really talk now – like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some – from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsynnikova, risking getting into a new GULAG or to form a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin gets along with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he doesn’t, he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are brave, but mostly alone, went to the protests and still held a small term, but soon he will get more serious.
For thousands of you, who signed the petition, who expressed dissatisfaction on social media (even if it was only a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were just an anecdote, have not been so far in the past – and now they are, most likely, waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will be missing?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that you can fight it.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how frustrating his advantage is on paper.
In spite of everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You are reading foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you are in contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it’s all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hohma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is going to collapse faster than I write, you have no more credit cards on the cards, you have no more credit cards to buy.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try or somehow go, or you will be disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet there is one more.
Which, in the end, will bring this regime down.
And, perhaps, in the conditions that have arisen, you will need less of it than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not blow up from you: due to the economic collapse that is aimed at Russia, it will most likely burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and wages will not be paid, those people who have voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the meetings in its own way, as has happened periodically already, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which will be able to be adjusted almost under any circumstances.
Navalny's organization has been crushed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand will come out, it will be amazed.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he force them into Ukraine, all because of what he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared in your place, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost for nothing.
Your son will make a joke in the computer game chat – and will be arrested; your daughter will be outraged on the Internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw camera under police scuttles.
This is what has been going on for many years – and will only continue to be strengthened, acquiring larger and larger scales.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it ends.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
What do you think of me as a press secretary?

I lived in a room where there were a lot of people. I was tired of energy.

But at night, I had a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'll be sure to let her know.
While working at the prosecutor’s office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mind-set job in which I was completely disappointed.
It’s a waste of time, but it’s a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but single-minded and I take marriage matters seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't found one.
Good day. Where in the Head can you buy forms for baking a paste (paper or silicone)?

Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to bother you in your spare time.

I went to Natalie's game room today to say good-bye to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
