Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, points to the myth that voter fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the United States, individual states are responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, since 2009, most U.S. governments have been declaring new laws that make it difficult for the election process to be put on the electoral list.
This phenomenon saw a spike after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states took part.
As a result, 180 proposals for a law restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, violate the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the election, and deprive citizens of the right to vote with registration in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID to be submitted to voters.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of India was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities have accelerated the expansion of this process to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not own a photo ID issued by the government of their state.
In addition, it does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are affecting mainly young people, persons belonging to minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have a required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their allegiance to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their identity card with a photograph exhibited by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs, who prefer Republican candidates, to use the cards displayed by those clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship in the elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that require voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Spanish minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported legislation in eight states that repeals voter registration on the day of the election.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 have led to a decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
The Hispanics did the same.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the adoption of laws restricting voter registration, democratic legislators and their supporters have, of course, stood up very strongly.
Democratic governors have blocked a number of bills by themselves.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
In part, they managed to limit the damage.
For example, laws requiring the submission of a photo ID were adopted by only 16 out of 34 states.
However, the newly introduced rules make the exercise of the right to vote unquestionably difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the preconceivedness of the passed laws and consider them to be an apparent attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws have been passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate necessary for the victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: to conduct an examination or not?
The PSA test produced the wrong results, which were incorrectly negative or even improperly positive, which led to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this further increased the weight of the men who had already dared to go to the examination at all.
Do you want to be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the US, there was a high degree of contamination among the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality among patients who underwent the examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who did not go to the study had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The most vulnerable group are also men of African-American descent.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are inefficient.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the extent of the danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not to necessarily treat prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active supervision of the disease.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them in life.
Rather, we will propose to them the implementation of active supervision and, in the case of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often, and with greater precision, we determine the criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment to treat and which one to not.
However, I recommend that you do the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, it seems to be the best means to limit the risk of disease by adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer is caused by heredity.
Some of the percentages remain unexplained as well.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It is very harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for Quebec.
Exciting data: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to the SCC, physical activity and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutritional
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid Uzenin, for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by drying, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to cancer development,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer. . . .
However, the research has not yet produced clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are, according to the SCC, disruptive.
Although one of them says there is a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study rather talks about its increase.
Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Determining yourself doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate outburst in the summer.
There is an opinion that this boson participates in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "less wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that Higgs's boson is involved.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle available that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto is more likely to confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume it's Higgs's boson, because the risk of mistake seems small, and let's see what it's really about.
In this world, there is an absolutely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed - and don't try too hard on it, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that the same law applies to it: Pauli's exclusionary principle, according to which two particles cannot take up the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is roughly pronounced
It further divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently obey Paul’s principle.
And at the other end, the bosons move, according to anarchists, who do not value anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, quite amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley labs: the mesons that we leave here without notice, and the "force particles" that spread great natural forces and with which the Higgs bosons are the most common.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particles of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
That is, when the particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a shell thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "carriers of force".
Stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, but with the difference that it is necessary to "disrupt" another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with the frozen level of the pond, which already consumes only a very large amount of balvan.
For this reason, it is necessary to use both a huge part accelerator and an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large Hadron accelerator with injection joints is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are again useful for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With an electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep on the fridge on its own.
And the same is true that with the Higgs field not all particles react: those that do have a certain mass, while others (like photons, let’s look at it) don’t have it.
And Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> is wondering, what are all these researches for, what "will they bring us"?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to substantiate the examination of any discrepancy between SM observation and predictions.
Moreover, not many physicists literally wish to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model still has huge flaws, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ooh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (again ooh!).
However, the CERN device has so far not revealed such discrepancies.
Responses
Responses to these researches in the everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak can only be very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to think that there would be none.
Look: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution that caused their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle – who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I’ve already said that – the laser was initially considered to be such a “play”
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn’t initially plan it at all, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Quebec, through its Commission on Dignity of Dying, has recently been involved in a clumsy end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue soon and at the same time the bill is going to be tabled.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this important area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this question.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in Victor-Gadbois' palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
Reluctantly, he looks at the delicious looking breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, brings him drugs, offers a bath.
Courage to die an ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of that passage, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“Throughout life, one learns that men wear wet clothes,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the abilities of the person,” the psychologist says, if the return is accepted.
According to the opinion of a number of people engaged in palliative care, the essential moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "to suffocate with full consciousness".
The disease has allowed me to see my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says, and then calls for us to put her in a breathing device.
However, she is still looking forward to her son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, the care of the body is provided with nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelov<0xC3><0xA1>, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, they can be given, for example, a can of brandy or Pepsi, according to their taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their blood sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, they brought Mr. X's beer, which died later that night.
This morning, his son is drinking beer in honor of his late father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In Victor-Gadbois they go one after the other, but they do not resemble each other.
In addition to a thirty-three-year-old man who is delighted by the last meeting with his family, deeply laid out on the pillows, while they drink in his honor, tragically dies a sixty-year-old man surrounded by his parents, a woman and two children.
“For half a year there have always been three to five beds that are intended for people with cancer under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal region, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to oncology patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental inaccessibility of medical care in Quebec that leads to a number of doctors specializing in palliative care fearing the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by top palliative care providers such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before they can consent to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency care in huge pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive proper care.
And at the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists take care of their patients up to the last minute regardless of the adverse prognosis.
The hope of survival of Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richards was already quite minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing the treatment, she replied that she regrets that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die are grateful to their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative care team alleviated their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home palliative care in the Greater Montreal area, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which the patient sleeps until the moment of a cut, either at the time of impact or permanently given the sedative.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, who will not get rid of the pain, will have an increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t always necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia”, rather it means “I want you to get rid of my pain”.
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” that mixes the construction industry, state officials, politicians, experts.
This "field" came to Quebec's taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took critical measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
In 2011, a scandal broke out based on a consistent probe into the misappropriation of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which was approved by then-liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest until after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding and state officials' corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “only the Department of Transportation has spared a billion-dollar contract,” when some people have kept their instincts to get a share of it!
Charbonneau’s commission, which “has led to the resignation of two mayors,” adds in the hope that it will succeed in “disguising the dignity of some people.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, founded in 2011, is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau family", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "money cartel" significantly mitigates the flooding of the contracts...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of inspections and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of public representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one of the suburbs.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec City.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting fees in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by Montreal-based transport engineers and Italian-based entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of "system" procurement of public contracts.
During these years, he dedicated 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, for which he was running for mayor Gerald Tremblay.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and dedicated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money managers whose prices have skyrocketed
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption was very chile.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail before the commission: within ten years he received a gift from construction companies, invitations to excursions, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and handbags worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for a penny.
Other public figures in the transport sector admitted that they had let the rewards be paid for having overvalued invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-work.
The mayor’s organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of unwittingly closing his eyes on the concurrent budget that brought dirty money into his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, putting Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, he has been campaigning against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the midst of a thriving real estate business since 2010.
70% of the money spent on election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that it "tightens behind the threads in an attempt to understand the functioning of the ants-promoted system to stop the gangrene and trap the culprits."
She says the process is “sick, but positive.”
We are in the stage of wound-cleaning, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and to ensure that these questionable practices are not returned.
It's like he's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have kidnapped hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "members informed of this fate" if they do not get into these chakras!
He estimates that 70 percent of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: “I heard it’s just a weak departure from reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100, but it does not resolve the situation: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer decline; if we focus courageously on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a firmer basis and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has tainted the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at their own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
I get along with them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And in games, it's easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't lose my head.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine, to the transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved by degrees.
So you are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s forces are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has extensive experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win another title in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The confidence it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you watch the first part of the PSG season?
In the first leg, Lyon took the lead.
But we remain in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the eighth final very easily.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for high-quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first so that we can play in the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a major European club, it has to win titles and sign up for history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this intention.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st league as in last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's going to happen this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have a weapon at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media is expecting too much?
It’s not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what’s been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It’s a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there’s still something to be found in the papers, it’s not exactly pleasant.
You ask yourself what more people can want from you.
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we've proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been in the finals for the second season, and they have also invested a lot of money!
Given the sum invested, you could be expected to have before the other 15 points jump!
This is an insult to other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which didn’t make much progress last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems like PSG relies on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good to say that there is a “dependency on Zlatan”.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved himself to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the person and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I experienced it, and I came out stronger.
Today, I am also able to play good matches in the national team.
I’ve been hoping for that since I joined the team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves so that our performance can be exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps as head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In qualifying for MS we are in a good place.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and is able to cheer for the win.
And so was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can buy and sell without a bank.
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs of processing between recipients.
As is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political outlook here: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between the two partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it is moving to the limit of about $10 (the price overview is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin calls it “the most successful virtual money”, “competition of the dollar and the euro” and “the currency of ordinary money”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it’s like “credits” used for the procedure in a video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and then swap back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are ordinary account book depositors, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place, in fact, between two e-mail addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This way, the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of ordinary accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write down this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will be entitled to write this additional line.
This is the process of cutting a file; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "cuts".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (worth zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then irretrievably displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would result in a change of print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly for the purpose of fraud (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is divided regularly into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but it can be divided up to one hundred million, so there is room for margin here.
The difficulty of the task is also increased with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and there has been a hijacking of stored bitcoins.
“The used chip is not about the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not run.
In November, a “big discount” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of an educational book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up by merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin rolls out, it’s still going to take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB foresees a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the greatest harm, which we punished because we thought they were terrorists.
And so did we, because we've lost 88 dead soldiers, and all those injuries and freezes.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former top officials who fled to Pakistan, but they are often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as they did in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains filled with almonds thanks to the French loans, was orderly.
Truck convoys and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack for the air escort of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure in 1994-1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid a price for the darkness of these peasants, who were completely in control of Al-Qa’ida, but their situation has not improved to our day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree to try to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became looters, authorized state lands, sold as building lands to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them, moreover, were never in a fight.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity will leave: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are already tired of the war and its associated ideologies.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they were introduced to the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five per cent of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows, which show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities, which will stand in front of her, be considered legitimate?
Former warlords against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralization modelled on Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the prime minister’s post, which had existed since the 19th century, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to recover, no overheating is working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
The priority is private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has a huge ungrowing wealth.
And it just gave the feeling that the Western states were here just to empower it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials over the mountains, however, no mining of weeds can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and left international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) to explore a vast Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls and boys' high school, the department of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative has worked to "get the heart and soul" in an effort to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, within which the service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was cancelled in 2012 but did not achieve the feat of organizing in the horticultural sector.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to silence the uprising: watering, wells, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the workable area.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for these farmers to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to achieve inadequate civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly touched by them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has made his way to the next game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the declaration of the constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the bait.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country’s fragmentation.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "abuse his word" and "slows the law".
However, his supporters assure that it is a means to reverse the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks' time.
It is a very short period of time that forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the text’s intention for the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is rejecting the protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people ahead of the ultimatum: "You either approve my text or I leave you unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the above-mentioned Constituent Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was proclaimed, they knocked on the door with the fact that they had no way to enforce their views.
The defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their step.
In order to achieve reproductive capacity, 11 people from a number of substitutes were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It will come as no surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further commented that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours of prayer, when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rule", which would allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Coverage", the liberals insist, who see only a grammatical problem in it.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on al-Azhar University, in particular on issues of control of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommierov<0xC3><0xA1>, this is disturbing, because "the people who are called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of the theocracy.”
The concerns of liberals are even more disturbing to the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there has been no specific religious impact.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them studied in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing for the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disagreements as to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent the civil judges are in order to express themselves.”
Yesterday's text, in addition to religious sites, is highly criticized for the expanded powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them from the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, the military courts will not prohibit the handling of civilians, as demanded by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
This association talks about its doubts in relation to the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal act of raping is preserved and the offense is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially then for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, says Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to perform in a televised speech last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The leaders of the state will be announced on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the bud of the world and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The land promised in itself combines the size of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the unhappiness of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Adhering to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that the mercy of God will descend upon all who enter into this "fun."
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning the water into wine at the wedding, walking the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here will go through the Path of Pain or the Path of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, the stone of atonement and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian dome of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where according to Christian legend grew a tree from which they made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of the Norse, the remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different denominations here leave notes with wishes, which will then be fulfilled.
Take a trip to the vertical
The destruction of the fortress of Masada remained hidden from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
Z<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>cenina is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can get to it by their own forces.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists from the foothills to this ski paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods were said to have lived on top of the mountain.
Visit the Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won’t be able to visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
In it are stored ancient Kumaran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and also about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish spa with figures of users of the spa and spa nurses of the time.
In Caesarea you can visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops here.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter - and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are blinking.
The names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
Israel’s three main spas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is by the way the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the level even people who are unable to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go out here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - salt water, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the intestines, diabetes, to cure your sedated nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past.
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv – the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia was passing through them.
Rumors of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
In fact, tourists love tolls with sloping streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press on the walls in the street "your" sign, you will be favourably inclined to happiness.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to let themselves be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "get" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pilate Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, in the dictionary
If you’re going to Israel, you don’t have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly used by the city, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
Basically, it's an underground ropeway.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a seat changer.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it ceases to work in markets, in shops and in public transport.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, squid-free fish and dishes containing combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of meals from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish kashi hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls from ground blackcurrant - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israel.
That’s why there are a lot of fed cats here, who gracefully “crush according to their taste”.
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Predominant cats love populated places and with a taste it is allowed to every goodness.
According to the car brand, renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Acquaintance with the country and rest received the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa on 9 February 2011.
'Great and powerful' announces it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, selling "fake" certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into effect, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass a test from the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who have successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are now open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to put many times in the press the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
In particular, according to representatives of the migration service, this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labour."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, chairman of the board of directors of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise with emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people, who under the pretext of helping him provide a "reference" to the terrible, cramped lodgings in which he and dozens of others, such as the day and the month, will be without eating it.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
“They promise them one thing in their country, but after arriving they will cheat them, take their passports away, not pay the promised wages,” confirms the head of the Tajik labor migration department MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't wait!
The less that many citizens of Central Asian republics, who intend to go to Russia for work, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with that work.
Of course, it is not their fault, as rather misfortunes: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that it is necessary to properly dress, enrich and equip them for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they have to leave for work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it is difficult – they admit.
"You feel humiliated and undervalued."
It is true that, given the language tests law, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only on migrants who have a legal status.
If they don’t have it, they won’t even pass exams or get any other official jobs.
In the meantime, most migrant workers, as before, live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Banned"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not at all easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They need a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Chuskadamov told reporters about his experience with Tajikistan's citizen Umed Chuskadamov.
"Come on, don't be easy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that fakes are not only documents of migrants about registration.
FMS employees have already seized a number of false certificates to pass the language test.
The counterfeit documents are printed on a plain color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free of charge: each of the migrants, in the hope of making it easier to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to ensure that the system against corruption is not easily bought by workers, and government officials and human rights defenders agree on this.
So far, government agencies can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time, the time it takes to complete the course of the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where there is no need to actively negotiate with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not enter the illegal arms market
The share of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the motive was the cases of shootings at weddings that went on without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogrady, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to wear weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarova, who has promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “drawing screws”.
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social gun organizations - demand the rejection of the "intentional strengthening" of the law.
The percentage of culling with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 criminal offences were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered bodies of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand criminal offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the strengthening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons do not accept the offender to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel in the service of Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of pages that accept gun orders
The first of them - the "military or military road", it means a weapon that was stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and caucasians themselves," Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the employees of the bodies involved in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "primarily" are being sold from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
"It is proven that some fires were deliberately set up - to cover up the lack," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the gun manufacturers also make their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive in the international market, and they are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the “black” market is grazing.
A particularly large number of guns and automatics come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There’s their production, sometimes weapons are made here in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists took up the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market “because of officials whose work is associated with weapons,” the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases, weapons were stolen during their production, 5% are "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores that asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in black "archeology" excavations long ago no one is buying - they're just too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers drive for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Through the sergeant, the interested party buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he'll sell it to you across the fence.
“It will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two containers,” he says.
“The truth is that the police are well-informed, and therefore whenever they start burning a plan to clarify criminal acts, they will conduct a check-up with dealers with illegal weapons,” the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Testing" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to the "corner" where we will act together.
I found out the price mainly there.
Military reporter Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - a consultant. - I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him completely.
There are marketers, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to arrange that the daughter fell out of the tooth."
And now I get there through the person I'm sure of.
He will also deliver them to me, because he knows that I will not deliver him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing cattle for publication on the subject.
The scheme, according to him, has not changed.
They gave him an album with photos, where there was "everything you thought about".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, do not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the forest and set a target for that.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I convince myself that the gun is firing well, we start to act,” says the procedure expert.
Storage box on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to the website and groups on "Vkontaktu", where you are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or a personal meeting.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," they write in an ad titled on the website "Buy a combat gun or a vending machine".
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>

"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).

The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a huge network of sprawling websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can steal a shovel.
People feed like hungry fish on the bait and then catch coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I’ve heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the limits of the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO "Right to Arms", told reporters.
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay without weapons and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When you buy illegal firearms, you usually pay from $100 to $900, according to experts’ estimates.
According to Dmitry Kislova from the NGO "The Right to a Gun", you will acquire Makarov's gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the medium article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia dropped by 7% in January-October 2011 compared to the period January-October 2011, and accounted for 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, and explosives.
Fast Food and Supermarket Workers Strike in U.S.
Working at the McDonald's cashier will pass up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky"
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it is doomed to disappear soon.
All these actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by a number of employees at Walmart and in fast-food systems, the aim of the organizers of the protests is to achieve in them the creation of their professional organizations.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seized millions of people, and in some cases accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, have left their jobs and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational business chain companies whose goods are intended for people of lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only shop at their workplaces.
Availability and assortment of goods have made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays little to its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
Protesters on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 per hour, but that doesn’t correspond to the amount of expenses, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, say that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, the company will cost $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves an increase in wages fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
During the year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should do virtually no harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, her treasury carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
A spokesman for the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview for the left-leaning Huffington Post website that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unobstructed treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart stores (those in that progressive city are not too popular, and therefore they are hardly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you off the sickness and he doesn't pay you well for your honest work!
Jumanae Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal laws and New York state regulations.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their number of employees in New York City is getting $8.90 an hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Jobs at "McDonald" will pass almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for too long.
Currently, I am constantly meeting in an interview with employees of "McDonald", who complain that they have to live with this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that treasure hunters and chefs at fast-food businesses start getting at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice as much as theirs.
They also called for the establishment of professional organisations in the field of fast-food.
U.S. laws prohibit the establishment of professional organizations and punish professional movement activists by bullying and letting go.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of a professional organisation in fast-food enterprises is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Nesouhlas
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the above-mentioned event was at a meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square on Wednesday, where several local Democratic politicians appeared, especially City Council member Jumana Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of dollars and then doesn't pay you a penny.
The protesters also garnered support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support fast-food workers so that they can achieve fair rewards for their hard work, as well as for the economy."
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food sphere.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain is able to cheat on average."
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means seeing the world especially through the edges of special glasses.
At the beginning of the year at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that the patent application was also filed by Microsoft.
In an interview with Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory’s leading group of interactive 3D technologies, Sharmam Izadim said the company’s glasses are a thing of the past.
It is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a frame what your research team is doing?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most it sometimes touches the screen with its finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting option of gesture control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, a lot of interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow has not been particularly good so far.
We’re trying to change that, we’re working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - damn it with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it's not overrated?
"It certainly cannot be considered an all-purpose medicine," the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about the dizzy ones, only about such cumbersome, short ones.
The gesture would not be a camera device, but a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of wristwatches.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this bottle of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine may or may not at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a close-up.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect a person’s reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - this is what we can detract from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, it's about the nuts and the depth.
At the current point of view, all of the current technologies are not enough for us - this assigns work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of shots per second is also very important.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and the current data streams of 30 frames per second are frankly said a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially manufactured sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects a person’s interaction with the machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some pictures per second extra.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- In Kinect, three "cameras" are now used, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And already the third camera - it is actually a common sensor of visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations carried out.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the camera’s location and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in the raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of augmentation of reality, when it would be possible to switch the smartphone from the cloud to the goggles at any time on the platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch-response!
His hands don't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that supplementing the bulk intakes could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain type of background for the display.
In an excellent way, it records the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding gravity to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, triggers a sense of urgency, but it's still very weak on the fingers - like the fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to steal your brain yet?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here there is another challenge, which will be fought for a long time - how to get a person, who is physically in a very tight space, to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we also work on the concept of running shoes, running shoes, etc.
If brainwashing becomes a goal, then work is still many years away.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers – a lot of things are in the beginning.
Vkusovshtina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements exceed the city’s limits, they often find recognition in Europe without reaching the All-Russian reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed up in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashionable pubs and at the vernissages.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a prominent man of the Petrograd avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of the citizens, increasing the mood for everyone.
He recently took the bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottler, as he matured into this complex role with all his divine life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although generally speaking, it is true that anything that is just a little different from gray awakens aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at getting an interview to be conducted.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in N<0xC4><0x9B>vsk<0xC3><0xBD> where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonivists, who brought us to Pushkin 10, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theatre, to clothing, to music, to all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art clinic... - For me it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkin 10, and before reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the St. Petersburg bohemians.
There was born a lot: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how <0xC5><0xA0>nura was brought with the project "Eye of Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under the plinth of a light song, dressed up in sticky jerseys, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galilean times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and professional training he obtained from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the nickname of Art Clinic.
This is where our staff and regular guests went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a survey was organized was in the press, a special price was "People in our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was nominated, thus ending my peak.
In the new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the current and pervasiveness is captured live.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today being such is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is wiped out, tragedy is felt.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of totalitarian rearmament in order of order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, they are oriented towards the external mechanics, not the internal man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and he needs to float in his face.
And the lie will be removed by overdressing.
- We saw you as a city bottler recently. - A cultural city should have a hero like that.
And who should he be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
People used to meet in the bushes, the bohemian loved one, the simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-society, today it is very difficult to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banker to please everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has its 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to the Stas Mikhailova!
- Fans will come to him, there's a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural ground and 10,000 of them will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will crumble.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will disappoint them and ruin what they have experienced.
When I was young, I painted images that hung on the wall with Falk and Larion at one collector’s house.
I started with pictures that people usually end up with.
Today, people often get mixed up in ideas.
They say:Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is out of date.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing pictures.
And I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
Not all of them are capable of culture.
During the time of the proper emperors, this was not the case at all, the emperors may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that real experts need to be supported.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and guide them on the right path.
Today, the taste buds thrive.
The same Erarta, but different in that they honestly say that we don’t accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What do you think Pet<0xC4><0x9B>rburk is?
- Pet<0xC4><0x9B>rburk - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And at our level, art is doing poorly.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers today, that’s wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have such a layer that is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented through the St.Petersburg grant
Born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landers on board set out on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of hardship or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg (SAI<0xC5><0xA0>).
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
The four generations of pea grown on a circular path are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out in orbit - very small fruity males Drosophila.
In 1979, a butterfly egg was sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of ease.
At the exit, we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
“There is a problem with this bird having to find resistance, have to stand on its own feet and start moving,” says the lead laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
If they can't find the resistance, the birds fall chaotically and make the turtles.
After 10 hours, a complete disappearance of instincts occurred in freshly hatched birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
“We’ve let the birds hatch twice, but then we’ve rejected it because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev, the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will only be one-sex beings.
He conducted an experiment with rats that were already pregnant when they were being sent into space.
In fact, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
After landing on the ground, a generation was born with cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their normal environment, they simply can’t realize their sexual instincts.
A human being, unlike an animal, in principle can.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkovs.
The most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Tchaikovsky flew off, and no one on Earth could tell if it would last a flight into space.
Is it possible to have a baby after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Va<0xC4><0x8D>nadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year later, she gave birth to Valentina T<0xC4><0x9B>re<0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>’s daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savické, who visited orbit twice and also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts that have been born after many years and the health of the offspring is growing.
“In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years,” said Valery Poljakov, a cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, the cosmonauts acquire the habits necessary to work in the open space.
Water mimics a state of ease.
Although for adults, water is both a comfortable but in its own way a strange environment, for young children it is a natural food.
Little ichthyands seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother’s fertile water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"It's very little about having a baby forget something," says Marina Aksenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the swim instructor for newborns.
In short - if the condition is more difficult for a newborn baby, then for women there is a more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In the state of weightlessness, there is a very rapid breakdown of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, the ability of the body to shed fruit decreases.
This can be left out if the muscle activity stimulants work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism discharges the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valery Poljakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not attracted to the earth, it cannot properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
Newborns on the circular path are not possible to dress as an adult in a special outfit with a load in which they could train.
It will simply get rid of what it needs for its development unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a person with a health condition that will be completely unsuited to the local environment," IBMP Bioethics Commissioner Igor Pestov predicts.
So the birth of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
But one day, a time will come when it will become a reality and when the earthlings will set out in their shells on a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the schwartz system has failed the fault of politicians
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controls and high-quality legislation, but it is failing in its application.
In an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala said.
"The law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right application - that's what we're missing in my opinion," Kala said.
A similar conclusion is also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nechas' approach to the so-called "schwartz system" is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be set in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither can the president of the government prevent the activities of an office that has a duty to monitor and enforce its obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, is followed by individual national legislation and then also the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "harder and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create ever more precise rules, but it is necessary to apply the law itself.
What can this project actually help you with, what’s the point of it for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to refine the laws, reduce and improve the limits, if it does not have such a positive impact.
To obtain the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price is to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal acts.
But by reducing the limit on contracts, we don’t necessarily have to do that.
Perhaps the system is bursting with such an amount of "paper" that those who want to search for holes in that system will draw from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or is it set up differently?
As far as the offices are concerned, as does the NK<0xC3><0x9A> there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in the same way as we do, also has a college, it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices are proceeding in the same way.
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these courts at the level of individual federal countries - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
The public funds that are administered by our regions and municipalities are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as the legislation in question is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is described as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don’t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider to be the model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for the domestic legislation, what did the new Public Procurement Act mean for your office, is there any evidence of its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it has not yet been shown in the control actions.
Since we are doing ex post checks, it is necessary to count on a certain delay.
We will only observe this so far in the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched our new tool "risk detection of insolvency", through which we have crossed almost 14,000 public procurements, and we have analyzed them - there will of course be changes in the form of amendments, because the types of amendments will change with the exception of
So do you think the adoption of this law is more of a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem, which can happen here, is that the rules are "tough" and will not be able to comply with them.
Already for the operation of the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a violation of the budgetary order.
Is the price of the law to be strengthened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who allow formal doubt that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDGs will not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called “black system” – and what does that mean?
Is the schwartz system prohibited or allowed?
After all, the law must be set in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither can the Prime Minister prevent the activities of an authority that is obliged to monitor and enforce its obligations.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are fairly strict rules as to what is to be formally implemented - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right application - that's what we lack in my opinion.
Roads are places that are frozen, but mostly vegetative.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
But most of the time, the trains are vehicular, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In Karlovy Vary this morning the roads were rolling, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it has to warm up slightly.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the slopes of the Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also less visible due to fog, according to data from the dispatch of the regional motorists.
The R6 motorways and first-class communications are now commuters in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is on the spot, for example, on some overhangs, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
There are also all roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads.
However, in some areas, there are still remnants of frozen and trapped snow.
Above all, in higher positions, it is necessary to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and K<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> Region
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic there is a threat of frost, in higher positions and in the mountains a layer of snow can be found on communications, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Motorists warn drivers of frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
It can be found near Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav are treated.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlick mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>na and Trutnov districts.
In the eastern Czech Republic, it is most often clear to clear with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a weak wind.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region
The roads in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are vegetative this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
This is freezing after the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below the point of frost.
After pre-snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications can be frozen.
The seats must also count on the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It is based on the information provided by the dispatcher of the regional motorists.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, with increased caution, however, recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plze<0xC5><0x88>sk and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are wet and also in this case a warning applies to frozen sections.
Drivers should be careful especially on less frequented roads in the area of <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
Olomouc Region
Today, snowshoes on the road must count drivers heading to the highest position of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spill, she remained on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle and on her way towards the Vistula Cross.
Motorists drove into the terrain at night of snowfall, in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk the roads were snowed about three centimeters, according to the administrators.
In other parts of the region, the carriages are mostly wheelchair accessible without restrictions.
"On <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk lies the rest of the snow in the highest positions.
With the snowfall on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle, drivers must count towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," said today <0xC4><0x8C>TK dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk<0xC3><0xA1> highway administration.
Their colleagues at Jesenicka also made their way into the field at night, and the roads to the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are unlimited, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk drivers should be careful in the forest areas, where the carriages remained wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> kraj, Liberec kraj
Several difficult-to-reach places are reported today after the morning of the road in the north of the Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in <0xC3><0x9A>steck is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
The operational complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of the glacier is reported by motorists especially from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for it were at night - during the day rain and pouring snow, at night clear and frost.
Unfavourable conditions are also reported from the main trains on the I/13 road on the border between <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> and Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
The fence from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by the scattered branches of trees, which were bent down to the carriage under the snow.
Simon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think the end of the world will be in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
“Together with The Tap Tap band, we’re more of a joke, and we say we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to keep the end of the world away or prevent it.
In December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to the readers?
This is a national charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before December 20 from 21 o'clock, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was probably my idea, and then we came up with everything together with our artist Honzo Augusta.
Not only do we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also sound on these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the complete conclusion, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems are also suddenly connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Thomas Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, also sings in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of charity events and concerts...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and enjoying working with us.
What will be the outcome of the concert against the end of the world?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
For students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, lecturers regularly attend and engage in activities that are fun and interesting to them.
The students themselves do not have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we try to enable them in this way.
As part of the delivery of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov Institute in the future, a separate building will be created, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We have tried to build a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinese, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xB3>, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
You can find out more at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombardment" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time in the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are already in the US, would like to link it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, for example, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric trolley, her trolleys have to travel in the luggage space, furthermore, of course we carry with us a large amount of cargo and a box with tools...
However, so far it has always managed without any problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have been well prepared for us, that I have admired myself many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, it was without problems.
With our tours abroad, you can compare how people differ in their barrier-freeness, public access to disabled people and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we were witnessing in Russia right now that everything in the east is still in its infancy.
Opposite to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric trolley to move himself in the center of the city.
There is no such thing as self-evident, as if you prefer a lift for wheelchair users.
Fortunately, there is already a civil society that is trying to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
In what, on the other hand, do we still have to reach a more advanced country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe handicaps to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life, on the contrary, we are a bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barbarism is one thing, but it is only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years back to what led you to establish it in 1998?
As a teacher, I entered the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I started an interesting musical circle with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xB0>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> tells us, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has come only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on promoting the band.
It occurred to us that a work that is not visible, in essence, as if it did not exist.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to reach it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
The show business is overcrowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is received with care and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural.
But this regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that when something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Has this success also helped that you are a strict boss, as many people have pointed out to you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the way to concerts, then the excitement is quickly gone.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The band currently has 20 members from The Tap Tap.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only L<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xAD>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, that can't be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the taste, has the door open for us.
To be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléd<0xC4><0x9B> and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by teleposting together with the song of The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDIO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free entrance tickets in pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the next few years participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (nr. 1905) kept listeners cool and after years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha prize for his entry into space science in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonauts.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of cosmonauts, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway line was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to disengage the trench or to stop it.
Information about this tressin is known only from the periodical.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery fire started to take over with rocket fire.
The research was carried out by Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Technika Uzarmenija in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustawe Mokrzyckiegi.
From the stored materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the professional press and in the following year the work of Rocket - an aerial torpedo and an aerial rocket bomb by author Leliwy-Krzywoblok.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Timely Advisory and Scientific Committee) was dedicated to all projects of military use of rocket technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended with the start of the war.
Other work on cosmonauts appeared in Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polish Astronaut Society).
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with cosmonauts.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already broken down and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn PTA has become a regular member.
And the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Racketa Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with access to 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage flight tests of the RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was already supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have access up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude of the wind.
However, in 1962, further development was halted.
As a result of the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket took place at the Institute of Aviation, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later are still to be mentioned.
Poland also participated in the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution has sparked a lively debate in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic structures, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, by no means limitless movement of private capital, together with endless financial speculation.
As a result of considerable differences in the price of labour, there is a price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state of affairs in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "underestimating" the competitor's price in order to gain a greater share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, and thus the responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is reinforced by the complete unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social social damage that he caused in the lawsuit for profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The careless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital to every person their own population, regardless of the social decline.
This is mainly reflected in changes in the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
However, this is done by a system of economic enforcement in the case of long-term unemployment, but by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with an increase in the differences between the poor and the rich.
For many years now, there have been public food outlets for the poor who cannot use their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to be paid such wages that they have to be paid to the existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Chamber.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hunger wages on the edge of society in the hope of slipping into a trap.
You have to ask yourself where it comes from.
If it’s from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or it doesn’t come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media in the frenzy claim that the state cannot participate capital in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy by controlling interventions.
Then one has to ask whether private capital does not affect, is now actually governed by politics, and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is a clear answer, yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
The situation in the SRN is such that the state ministries for the lack of financial resources mandate the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are dense in connection with the industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as Western-style constitutions proclaim it, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes it in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic during the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities have been engaged in violence.
For fees, illegal obtaining favors and with the help of stones or swords.
The subjugation and corruption of the people were without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote, but the people of character did not go to the office at all, so once as a result of this revolt was to stand for eight months without consuls.
Conclusion Just as in the past, the present society is based on the careless preference of self-interest, regardless of the interests of the whole society.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, able to understand and apply the whole social benefit.
The result is now, as it was then, the unprecedented decadence of the elites without any attempt at deeper-scale reforms.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the careless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elites completely ignore in the future the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new histories.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both the international and internal European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in a society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: A laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be any” – Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there has been a lot of reaction.
Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defense and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who is in the periodically recurring waves of guilt-killing and who the victims, at the end of the day, the people of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and didn’t experience the beginning of violence.
I am about to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at what has been used especially for 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the country of the Middle East.
Some of my reflections are supported by the available historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main hub of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomous in their steps and whether there was anyone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and its resulting power could not have happened in the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the head of the nursery (if someone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschilds.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s to stop linking its name to high-crime acts, in which they stood, and which for them always meant a consolidation of power, a multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the stakes in the central bank do not lead or prepare for wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi the central banks remained in the hands of only four Russians).
Anyone who tried to raise this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschild’s Bank of America, began to issue his own (understanding government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in the theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for triggering a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to formulate the plan of the three world wars as the zennare of the highest, 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
the first war was meant to remove the great monarchist states in Europe, the second was not meant to remove the colonial empire, especially Great Britain, and the third was meant to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are not needed for the sake of the needy), the second was not to abolish the colonial empire.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by Rothschielda is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat crises such as the one they triggered in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in killing the Habsburg successor of the R-U to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly, militarily and economically unfounded, with the surrender of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy Imperial Russia) and subsequently the break-up of Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating a presupposition for the radicalization of the rogue masses, and then they had only to subdue the rogues to the Germans.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population have begun.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, whether Hitler ran out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or all he did was plan to make it difficult to estimate, however, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created a precondition for the acceptance of the world.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany was made for World War II, a third war fire was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If the international bankers manage to launch it, the Jewish nation, as in the second, will be the victims in the front line of the fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of controversy and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s just take into account how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the crime is the result of a crime in the endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of it was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple citizens of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers emphasize the choice of the people in the elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of the fascists, the world bankers of the loyal, the politicians who are doing all they can to start a war with Iran, who, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, etc.), is a rebel.
As David Rockefeller put it in 1994, “The only thing we need is a general crisis, and people will agree with the new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new-born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
And he compels all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on the forehead of the cup, so that they may not buy or sell who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of its name.
That is to be understood: who has reason to count the numbers of that beast?
That number is a human number, and that number is sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and occupied 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Réz Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome – throwing a chess board over the deck could not be allowed, as it would significantly jeopardise the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the failure of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats’ prisons were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their legacy at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
Debakl made a significant contribution to the loss of Jimmy Carter in Iran with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Ben Affleck's film Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled from it.
After complex peripeti, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover story – they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who were visiting locations in the country for sci-fi big film.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendez, an expert on "exfiltration", also required cooperation from Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, a press conference was held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a shock - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates the moods - on the one hand, the documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no major differences in that).
On the other side of the easy passage from Hollywood, lined with irony and a slight overabundance.
And then there's scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits are discussing the situation at the conference tables, at the office halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck’s career was re-started in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor he became a respected director and also his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which is not played in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director’s older films had elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when it is cleaned up somewhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (fake staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story doesn’t actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He works quite successfully with it, sometimes he thinks of reality - everything doesn't come out so elegantly there (the scene in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone in America and the chase after the ranch seems to be quite drawn to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the disparity resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in this film.
Affleck’s film is so slightly losing its dramatic twist, it is a shot that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thriller of the 1970s.
But it's hard to beat.
As a reminder of one so far in a certain way of living history and proof of how exaggerated are the ideas of omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually announces the most absurd banking fee survey, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop”.
"It has led us to the last event where the EU plans to accept a 40% quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said law organizer Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of rates of insurance for men and women.
So far, women in life insurance prices have been favoured, as they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
A controversial EU regulation may also include mandatory inclusion of bio-components in propellants, which, as a result, harms the nature, further prohibiting the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, high levels of mercury, or high levels of mercury.
Criticism had previously also faced a de facto ban on the use of the term ointment oil or the removal of classic bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a certain state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now, even with the threat of veto, is enforcing the demands of its banks).
The lobby’s interest was also due to the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach a length of at least 14 cm and were not allowed to exhibit “anomalous curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only the previously non-uniform national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU’s standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened through the resistance of some countries, indicating that the existing Directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the poll victory may also be the EU regulation last year, according to which it must be mandatory for sold inflatable balloons to be warned that children under the age of 8 may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to U.S. research that balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocate.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when snorkeling into tow trucks.
Curious ideas are also born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, and must speak for it about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece.
Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire to the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, including the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the Member State.
The EU set the maximum volumes of food supplies that could have been found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants on request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said Jaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, full stocks had to be made, which he had to export.
Because the Czech Republic has further access to the ports, according to the Palace, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out of the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, to cancel the application for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the regulations easily become the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States in the course of budgetary negotiations.
Emotions between the Czech Republic are also aroused by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this fight.
The Czechs, after a six-year battle with the Germans and Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anas, sought the designation of Olomouc forms, but the domestic rum, the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed as a domestic rum.
The naming of rum can only carry products from starch distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-renowned cheeses of Feta and Gorgonzola, marzipan from L<0xC3><0xBC>beck, Germany, or Parmesan hams, for example, have been found in Karlovy Vary, Pohoric and Trebo<0xC5><0x88>ské capers and Jatice hops.
The EU trademark can also boast a pardubian pen and a bitter tube.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how does one think he wants to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can’t see how the country has been ripping apart over the last 20 years, how thieves are running around, people are raising taxes and the age of retirement.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you've gone to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the castle as a result of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My goal, however, is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can achieve my vision.
Therefore, I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that we, as a nation, give in to the pub and the television, but that we will spoil anyone who wants to try to change.
To this is added the media, which dethrones a man and which weaves freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I may have been told that I was a paid journalist or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubk.
Let's get to your vision.
In the battle for the castle you have come up with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property confessions over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, was lobbying for guidance to be a free-spirited activity, I was able to put it into practice.
The problem is politicization - when someone comes up with a good left or right proposal, the approval will be rejected, and the citizens will refrain from doing so.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without the party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are rather left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong thinker.
You'll be disappointed if someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or they were talked about by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have passwords left.
You won’t get enough of that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce criminal and material liability, for example?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to get us through it.
If I had been elected president, it would not be a problem to arrange a television live broadcast, where I would ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell her why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality that will name the villains, it can be pushed into the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a merit of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, so if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been going around a lot of famous people, whether or not they're going to run for Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who was covering up frauds with light hot oils.
I've been running for a position where people are really unhappy, but now I'm on a roll.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls and those who went mostly elected the representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have called for the Senate to make the changes difficult.
Still, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of caregivers or heitmans.
Are you thinking of setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the clean past of every potential sidekick, and I don’t have any money for that either.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, I have only 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about property recognition, what is yours?
I estimate private property to be around 60 million.
In Prague I have an estate for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million and then I have a few million on account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream – I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time was fighting against evil and evil.
You're driving Aston Martin, you've got a fortune of 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Is that what I owe you?
I've already killed 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors proves that I don’t have that much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign basically covers how much I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're going to cancel these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I’ve partially cancelled my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How often have you been an entrepreneur on a monthly basis?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'm taking on.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.
You can find the whole interview in the Saturday edition of the Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain Books - 2 pictures
"This building looks fun to me, it looks futuristic, and it's finally something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder what we still need in the library for today.
They all have the internet, iPads and e-books.
Nobody goes to any of these old-style libraries today voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a seat close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this silly situation, a few years ago, the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not at all inconceivable.
And so the city councillors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely bold column graphs and the maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with ordinary calm and at a competitive meeting in 2003 appeared on the floor with five benches and benches on the floor.
And while the commission was still looking around and scratching its shoulders, the brave Maas made his gifts to himself according to size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small-town gray, which could not yet offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer with a bit of modern architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: reader's eldorado under the cover of cheese.
By means of a massive mountain, the lift is driven, but you will discover the real spatial and reader's passion until you walk through the topography.
From all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning chandelier and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have built a classic spatial configuration on top of our feet, and we have moved the space for the readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain Books is beautifully used: on Wednesday there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a central home technique.
Special delight are the black shelves for books, which are once a covering of walls, once a parapet and sometimes a railing of stairs.
Appearance, structure and smell act strangely.
Over the unknown building material, it will even involve architects and construction engineers with its heads.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, at the request of Standard magazine.
And so, one day, in a farm in Friesland, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre round of synthetic material has been used as a substrate under the roots.
It is cheap and time-effective.
Thin textile will last one, two seasons and then mature to be thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the rouno - for the first time in such a quantity - was carved on boards of four centimeters in thickness.
With the effect of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters of long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figurines in flower beds.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house, despite many glass surfaces, is a demonstration project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with earth heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines only briefly inside, even in sunny days.
Wide glued wooden hinges, which stand a corner to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest, he will be able to handle fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to open several weeks ago to dedicate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, for the first time, the optical gaps in the not fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 pieces, were to be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The police are fully booked.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This enabled the MVRDV to succeed in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
Whatever it is, young and uneducated.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Berlin is balancing diplomacy on a tight border.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This is where NATO came into being.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is currently changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the policy, which was supposedly controlled by the United States, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settling down in their role, but they're on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows the readiness to engage in cases of national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests have an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
For the first time, Germany has a large outpost in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I wouldn’t want to add too much importance to it, it’s not a one-sided relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations anyway.
Has Germany’s relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not think it was such a dramatic break as in the question of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain a certain amount of respect.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, made a clear statement for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is probably hiding a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But as a result of this political situation, this position cannot, of course, stand in public.
I don’t think the differences in opinions are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to state its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot, therefore, be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take on the leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play an independent role.
Do Germany see itself as a significant international player? Do they want to take on the lead role at all?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, then every time Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and will make it much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
This is behind the label, which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as it is not complained by the actual owners of the brand.
Even then, it is not clear whether the rights are being respected.
“For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in violating protection rights in the Far East.
Every week there's a new case on my desk.
A few more letters are enough for counterfeiters to be able to sign up for their brands.
The Gucci brand, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they let themselves register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied.
The patent opens the organizer with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company left to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that parasitizes even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey business houses, where fakes are almost exclusively sold.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: he opposes the commissioning of his mandaters to give Chinese companies the official right to use the mark, which is already protected elsewhere, from the trademark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
These are the women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The mark will dissolve, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is immense."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to the CLSA market research firm, China, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market.
However, it is difficult to get rid of questionable records in the trademark register and something is worth it.
Driving can last up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch recounts cases where the court rejected the lawsuit, as the denominated name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
When the plaintiff has a bad side, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German pump manufacturer for the Putzmeister concrete mix.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, the company that bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO’s trade mark office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too small numbers of employees and space.
But last year, it was alleged that “the course of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to normal.”
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending in the office.
Something against it is expensive to do.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is behind a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was chosen on the fees.
Simply put, this means that each login on average costs 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To begin with, the dispute is worth several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, achieved that his illegal production of imitated car parts was cancelled.
However, the counterfeiter has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand and continues to do so.
We would have forgotten this ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances Freudenberg did win the rights, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that this will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “Drive is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company’s archive, they even had to look at a hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered "a high six-point sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
“You can see what that means for us,” says Wentzler.
The threat from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that's in case the impersonators get unprotected marks there.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to apply for the Freudenberg mark for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business activity has long since given up, yet it has managed to block registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch’s lawyer advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, and foreigners would rather have "everything that is worth protecting in any way, to apply in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the label in the last episode of his drama, then he will probably have to pay licensing fees on the contrary for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Sucking, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is being tested - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who have died of AIDS are happy to do so.
The story of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there’s the ass: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies’ boat and men’s moccasins looking for tact on the parquet and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - rush, mother and argue with each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he combines his voices with his train-like wild gestures.
It is Monday evening. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is testing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from human genetics researcher to housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - the zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
Unaids, a United Nations programme for the eradication of AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive accounts for more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Estijeni found a society called Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, the patronymic can be taken over.
It guarantees a child's school uniform, school uniform and one warm meal a day in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language "the narrator of stories" or also "the one who praises".
No one in this room can speak with a gas bantu<0xC5><0xA1>tina, only sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes also bringing them back to where they originally came from: to South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, the village of Estijeni is located in the northeast of the Swaziland, which is dependent on the strength of the votes of the German congregation.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of them still in simple clay or straws, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been exposed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjen there is a small picture of what the whole of Swaziland is like: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity in themselves. There is no rarity that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. However, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they no longer have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was also a private placement of individuals, which allowed for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, a group of "Voices for Africa" was founded, which since then has cared for orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Bones and ulcers belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is one of the most affected groups?
Syphilis and capillary occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual intercourse between men.
In heterosexual adults they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (plunge), capsicum and human papillomavirus.
HIV is relatively limited among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of newly infected people are in this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What Are the Symptoms of Sexual Illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore remain unattended.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The risk of infections can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurity and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent exchanges of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable gifts and, last but not least, to the fees that the choir will earn by singing all over Germany, some money will be raised.
“We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estijeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can bet.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example, in some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu language refers to old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children were delivered every day in school uniforms on time.
Children who no longer have one go to the hut to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid for by the society as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa founded a sewing school, built two stalls and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to take the HIV test.
Although the disease is so obvious across the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has something to do with sexuality.”
In fact, quite strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immense lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different – unprotected contact.”
To at least encourage a little bit of cultural exchange, the Imbongi band travels once every two, three years together across South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the blacks, many of whom are known in the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Estijena, where the singers visit the children, over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than well known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Estijeni, there is light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers from here by air, to the snorkeling singers in the Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e rehearsal room, you see that light is shining here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury led
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the closest to the Sun is located, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published on Thursday by the expert magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even 20 meters strong.
This water came from comets, or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not give the ice found in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the lead scientist working on the Messenger spacecraft, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots such as Phoenix, the unobservable aliens, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images come out to Earth, a small window into endless dungeons.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.

Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not, according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union, a "planet."
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, more identifiable are pink-colored "new-greens" in the star's birth hall.
This region where the stars are formed—the scientists call it the W5—discovered Spitzer’s telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing glow of dying stars was captured by Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The hollow ring consists of a material that the star has wiped out during the process of dying.
In the huge Trifid nebula, which is 5,400 light-years from Earth, a new star emerges from gas and dust.
Photographs of the galactic "cradle" were taken by Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better.
The fog Helix may appear to the observer on this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to the Earth's crust has led to this fog of naming North America.

One of the largest and brightest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: The Creature Galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real art pieces.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light-years away the Trifid nebula in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this star-forming constellation into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the warning of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, two merging galaxies collide with each other and must inevitably collide.
The birth of this star was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don’t like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Windmill.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a cut-out of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains, which are ten times to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's cosmic telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is known as the UGC 1810.
In this star cluster is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way galaxy.
The star cluster makes it possible to create ever-new additions.
Also, this starry cloud, associated with the Rosette nebula, gives birth to ever-new young stars. They are 5000 light-years away from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it originated only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe stars a year before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasing – and the views they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
There is a large binocular telescope in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, it has an average of about 11 meters.
Disadvantages of cheap construction method: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, this equates to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) – the search for extraterrestrial intelligence – can help any computer owner who makes its computing power available.

There's a Very Large Telescope standing here -- and it's doing an honor to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to be 42 meters full and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the pictures can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered to be the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer at once two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea a new giant telescope is to be created - with a three-inch mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe convey to us the Hubble Space Telescope.
Photographs of distant worlds have been given to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 – especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected from the beginning of the mission.
The picture shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will first be launched into space in 2018 aboard the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits around this planet much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink the butter every day and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will experience the biblical age.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will experience the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
You can call it a wild romantic ride in the mountains.
The microbus crawls along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, rugged rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Taly<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x97>s lives, which is not very well known, except that he speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and experiences a very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town is adorned with too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too easy.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku celebrated the Grand Prix of Eurovision in May – and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year,” says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only museum in the world.
Here is documented the lives of almost eight dozen Taly<0xC5><0xA1>ians from the area, who are over a hundred years old.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the disputed star of this museum is the shepherd sheep of Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>m, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, the age of the Muslim seems to be extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he reportedly still had a daughter.
Hasn’t Shirali Muslim been mistaken for a few decades at his age?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the people flying in Central Asia.
“Likewise, many seniors live in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “and in Sardinia, too, there are extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the missing evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik experience the biblical age strikingly often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many people live in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyshes.
The director of the Fatulyev Museum, on the other hand, believes that it is based on nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of the Taly<0xC5><0xA1>, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem exactly plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, the home of Rubaba Mirzayev.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzayev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a hammer, which he tirelessly sticks.
Under one roof there are eight people, including one of Mirzayev's sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical swirling glasses "armada".
Mirzayev's white teeth form a perfect line and under his hat he hides a long dark blond copy, which his son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzayev says.
Retirement for a month is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven’t even bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But things got better when Gejdar Aliyev's "beloved father" took over.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no limits.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the widow of his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the ratio of benefits from which you can get a good living.
And perhaps he is right, even a long time ago, Mirzayev’s son: “Old people are very serious in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, baked and happy.
If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of “human rights” in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The deplorable demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep disintegration.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, is under discussion.
The Egyptian president did not cure the disease.
We have to make a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, in front of people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire nation, but above all for Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular figures.
All of them, so far hopelessly disillusioned in a confused opposition, are afraid.
The fear of the “state of God” on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized for temporarily restricting the constitutional court’s jurisdiction and extending his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the U.S. University of Southern California, really wants to save, is that neither the Egyptians nor the world are clear about it.
Should the judiciary be stripped of its power?
The 234 paragraphs, which were quickly approved by the Constituent Assembly, with the predominance of Islamists, in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are in part a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and is an interpretation, and one can fear that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the legal space associated with it for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least this is reflected in the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia law, it is necessary to consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would bring the judiciary to a de facto abolition of the rule of law.
In the draft of the Constitution there are many interpretations
The problem is also that the civil power of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used for Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is so vaguely worded on the legal side that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
In other words, no paragraph in writing excludes the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the Hanobit or the intercession of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what the offense is and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally doubtful that the wording that is forbidden is “insulting people”.
In this case, is it enough to caricature the president or joke on the account of legal experts?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit for signature and will, in his words, "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, the opposition has been forming against the Islamists’ excesses.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and pledged to destroy the constitution before it even began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabb<0xC3><0xA1>h<0xC3><0xAD>, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed Baradej said the draft of the constitution was “a waste of history”.
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s supporters of wanting to carry out a “fight against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition official J<0xC3><0xA1>sir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali said.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would become invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a counter-demonstration, but cautiously not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
She was attended by many veiled women and supporters of Salafists, who cried out: "People demand the application of the law of God."
They called out to Mursi, "Clean the land!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for supremacy over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably trigger a similar civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at election hours decide which direction the country should go.
For sure, the majority is considered in favor of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not exist even once."
The forced constitutional dispute, which is supposed to continue until February and integrate all social forces, is the anniversary of Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
An eight-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were behind Mubarak in jail or in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was convicted, convicted, and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution now, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
The murky expansion of power to all three power units in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous accusation against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he actually abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without the organization of civil society, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of the way.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns: “You have created a monster that you can no longer control.”
Norway's Shark: The World's Most Scented Fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the local appetite for exceptionally fragrant fish?
Take a couple of mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
So you get a paralyzing smell of crab, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, a beautiful view - and in the air the ubiquitous smell hangs.
Rakfisk is a salty trout boiled in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and it starts to get cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are starting to meet at a festival dedicated to how to say it best, the most suspicious food.
"You dream it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfish General", who is responsible for the festival.
People all around us eat small pieces of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to sharks," says Havard.
The drink can overcome the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that has been on the long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, in the autumn the fish were soaked in airtight vessels with water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well pampered, they pulled out and ate - the senses undoubtedly drowned with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large amount of work, high profits, and an extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway recently, flow into the country for work.
The shellfish is considered to be something important, indispensable, even though it is a relatively stifling part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive foods on the market.
Even though expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global news - and it seems that most of the population does.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22nd incident.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth is the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re doing so well,” says Anna, who’s a prototype of Nordic well-being with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes.
We're, as you're called, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely beautiful.
We don't pretend, we don't like showing up.
Norway is handling its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had cords firmly stretched on their castle.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat shellfish," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat - I've had enough of the reef.
Such a slice of burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where you can have a box for dinner and where guests choose the best or rather the most demanding fish for their taste.
They have a connection to a live television broadcast, in which a moderator with a butterfly is surrounded by plates with a shellfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and laughter.
There's a man in the chair, maybe with an aquavit.
Or maybe some steam from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In the city, which is connected even in the best times, steel bans were erected, closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent the commuters from getting to work, but to prevent the Protestants from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive a presidential swab and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
At the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, Mexico was doing well economically, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a huge commitment to reducing violence against the Mexican people," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking his hand with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
The citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new motorways that Pena Nieto has built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the winding and winding roads that used to be here.
Plates with its name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for President Pena Nieta, Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected inside the party from Enrique Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of the opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very direct person, very passionate about the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Nestled beneath the highway junctions in many ways, it resembles the suburbs of Mexico’s capital city itself.
And the problems in the self-governing village are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called on to help cope with drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women in particular was particularly reprehensible.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been looted in the empty spaces next to a huge landfill.
At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico State, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieta say that he failed to act in office when dealing adequately with the problem of the murder of women.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for a spoiled neighborhood, Irina Buendia shows me a photograph of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," Buendia recalls.
There were marks on it after the blows, and the postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, where there is a single word: "Justice".
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old scoundrel, a troubleshooter, and a janitor.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and I'll forget," he says.
The scarf that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised that during his tenure in office, it will be his priority.
“I hope he’ll be the same president as he was the governor,” says Pri Olvera, a member of the Valle del Bravo delegation.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain about misbehavior, says military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding the rough treatment of the prisoner.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in the town of Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Voj<0xC3><0xAD>n is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The U.S. military prosecutor is trying to prove that Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
May's military prosecutor Ashden Fein at a cross-examination of Manning's army at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with officers of the unit during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing of the defense’s proposal to reject the case against Manning because of the gross treatment at the time of the bond, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning’s testimony about the fact that
An army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At a hearing on Friday, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed a form that officers filled out after meeting Manning at a detention facility in Quantic, where he was held under heightened alert from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked by Fein on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and that the overall treatment at the facility was "very professional".
The forms do not indicate any complaints of misbehavior, even though Manning officers directly asked how they were treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that concerns about the various problems had been expressed orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not report these problems.
"They asked for 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 during a meeting with a committee assessing the suicidal idea he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injuries prevention" regime.
The Army stated that this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime for the cause of suicide) had used it for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it here," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and he fainted because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very discouraging.
"My world has only crumbled at the base of Arifj<0xC3><0xA1>n, at the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattress, a cover, earphones, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning’s legal representative filed a formal complaint against Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the charges he made in a Thursday statement that after being forced to sleep one night in his Quantic cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellow prisoners in the morning count.
Manning said he was not allowed to cover himself with his cover when counting.
During a Friday hearing, Judge Manning stated that, on the orders of his guards, he decided that he had a cover that he could cover, to put off, but admitted that no one had given him the order to put her off.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he was trying to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his earbuds to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that night his underwear, his eyelashes and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans Manning to plead guilty to lower criminal charges and that he will fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend binding terms as warranted.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with the regulations regarding all detainees held in custody with maximum caution.
Among the charges brought against Manning include the assistance of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If charged at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to insufficient opportunities that are there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico’s capital, I barely got through the crowd and arrived at the immigration agenda room where I encountered the problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cities").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life I was called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to be able to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in front of the Aliens.
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House this week.
The program had common issues that are being discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of arms to rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, the memories are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the U.S. representative says something just a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite a complaint about how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the Montezuma children will walk on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, that real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who the country offers opportunities, and others who don’t.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or an ancestor, who in Mexico was denied the opportunity to get married.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And yet we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans of the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and look upon us as a sub-race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families hadn't moved to Mexico, they wouldn't have left her.
And we would not now be trapped behind a silk cloth, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don’t like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of a single one.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in one.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “temporary ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and push for political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Oh, no.
Then it won't happen.
There are too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States of America for their dealings with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disliked for the way they treated their family in the past.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
The Old Battles, the New Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an insurmountable basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such mishap is futile.
Among the usual useless deals about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the Israeli metropolis.
But even though it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians have been trapped in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to believe that it can disrupt their deadly path situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are not many reasons for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21 persisted, this week’s fighting would strengthen the squabbles on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another part of Palestine that is currently under the control of its fierce rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists all over the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a re-emerging regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The jihadists from Hamas say that an Islamic half-month is being held around Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s party/militaries rule, across Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to Islamism, can sit in front of Bashar al-Assad, as far as Jordan is concerned.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, he changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab country, equilibrium in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the Brotherhood of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be ruled out either by Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was stored back in the box.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unstoppable as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
And above all - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the president of the government, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been a relative calm in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall, which intervenes in the West Bank, the main part of what may once be the Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements from being overcrowded and overcrowded.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22nd election, is in a good position.
Why smear the pro-Arab Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles like their Gazans did?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and dust them when they shake their heads.
Perhaps the defenders of the hard line will win, but the Arab spring can change their estimates.
Although Islamists, who gain power in Egypt and other countries, do not love Israel too much, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than the spending of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi has cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it is creating a denial of Palestinians’ right to self-determination of the Palestinian courts with gunpowder, which must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, repressions are weakening in the Jewish state of democracy, and demographics are making this situation even worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks on Gaza, which take place every few years, in order to suppress Hamas, will increasingly be subject to a diplomatic tax.
Both sides are in need of outside incentives.
The answer is what sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers are reporting: the two states where Israel will move the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from abroad at least a little greater influence on the implementation of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must rely on stopping arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967 border-based Jewish state with the exchange of parts of the country and the sharing of Jerusha.
The Arabs on the outside must also push for an agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make for the creation of a Palestinian state more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally brazen in his entry into the process.
That's unfortunately short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Law on Harmful Cigarette Packaging came into force.
On the invisible green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are displayed a warning for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and the logos and colors of the brands replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting images of sick parts of the body and the depiction of infants and newborns.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes of brand names that are printed with the same small letter is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to keep young people away from smoking by removing this habit from its attractiveness.
It’s based on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking by age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them along with their product,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a mouse-to-mouse logo.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase black market trading, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover nasty boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan's smelting tobacco from the most smelting smelter
Ha said that Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and is expecting new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible backstop, the experts state the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring the majority of sellers to hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is for you an insurmountable place to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health research fellow at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by “average Honzo”.
We have to ask ourselves, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave himself the job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations – countries within the World Trade Organization (WTO) declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are significantly out of business.
The SOO decision is expected to be adopted in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now it has expanded to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"Just pull out your cigarette and stick the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason I stopped smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack traffic in central Sydney, claims that thanks to uniform boxes it is harder for him to level them into shelves.
"It took me an hour to put in the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
“The government should just ban them completely, then we’d say, ‘OK, that’s it, let’s close the store,’” he said and decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored.
The last day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don’t have a chance to get bored.
Should we, then, support boredom?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Actually, it has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century of our year.
And then there’s the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would please me, but I was not able to."
The boredom differs from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is “the disruption of the attention process associated with a bad mood and the feeling of slowly passing time.”
Fatigue can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, bored people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television show in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn’t hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show quietly reported greater boredom than the other two groups — they had difficulty concentrating, but they weren’t sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, dispersing music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that spinning and scratching, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom fight and keep people physically more alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Fenske said.
We’ve all experienced boredom at times – a delay in my flight, a squeezing speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom in the 80s of the last century, scientists have developed a "Stairway to Addiction to boredom" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The steps include questions like, "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these degrees, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimuli.
Teenagers are generally insecure.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that "singing is a peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “Is boredom good for you?”
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nude is a way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will make you happy only for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is being transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant vibration of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
“We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,” he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off."
In Colorado, there is no guide to the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces charges of criminal offences for something that will soon be legal across the state – for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was riding with several friends in Lamar, on a plane near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After a police officer found him in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was issued a drug arrest warrant and drug use equipment — petty offenses that cost him $100 per fine — and was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the unprecedented weeks after the Colorado vote on legalizing a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the location rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana-holding violations have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount, which will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, and continue to accuse people of being held.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver are voting to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads are drab and regulators in Washington state.
And they're looking for a guide on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first in front of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it’ll be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State alcohol licensing board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There’s no real precedent that we can follow,” he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal stance.
And there are frantic mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance the state’s directive on a “relevant approach” to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade up to 330 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds, and children’s playgrounds.
“There will be nowhere more difficult to place a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently founded research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the city's prosecutor will no longer prosecute offences for holding a small amount of marijuana in each of the citizens of Aurora's "old age groups" and that the police "shall pay the fines" for each citizen of the 21-year-old population.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the Weld district of northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a closer look.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to press users to seek treatment.
Currently, he faces charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana to 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is under an obligation to prosecute criminal charges that were criminal offences at the time they were committed," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer accuse adults of holding a small amount.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to refuse all pending cases of detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And counter-reactions across the state have revealed, in view of this great state green experiment, a deep divide between local officials.
For district attorneys, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants in possession of marijuana, and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to build on a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national drug legalization test cases.
Prosecutors and state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sale, and at the same time are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will be misled.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients who use it, which attracted attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana business in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are likely not to knock out the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will oppose allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana businesses authorized by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former district administrator.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana deals, although it will take about a year for any deal to open.
Last week the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and it is likely that next week it will enter into force.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we license someone and then we're going to have a big federal affair," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our town voted against this addendum.
We're looking at what the town voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative.”
Today’s college students are not the only ones who are being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern-day accused Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 80s of the 20th century, two weeks after attending Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases, and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave it up because I had objections against loving students in the next room.
Writer A.N.Wilson boldly declared that I had left because I had been forced to drink from sealed jars.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that the new generation of students to the right from the center are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students were committed to the same protections of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Young Men’s Association (JCR) claim that because of their political views they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome.”
They call for the creation of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary series, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about a student political event that the Conservatives portrayed as odd and neo-Nazis.
The series featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver headboard.
At other colleges, conservative students say that they are treated as "victims" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence on universities is growing.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting with us.”
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant", while nineteen-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of JCR members towards people from the center-right.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and in a humiliating way shy.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was the most reprehensible.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to grant the honorary degree of a former student Margaret Thatcher because of a shortage of funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be worried.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students connect with each other and with professors, I got to taste the straw that was to come.
I found that not only do the professors quietly approve of the ascent of the conservative students, but with taste he also participates.
The policy of mining strike, privatisation and government resistance to anti-apartheid sanctions in the Republic of South Africa has been brought into the wood-covered auditoriums.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please postpone the first paragraph."
I've had enough of it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very gallbladdery.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students nodded.
Tears fell in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, that is, if you are not too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I came back to my room in shock.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Most of the conservative novices pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be a coward.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A student of the first-year branch of philosophy, politics, and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took note of him.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They talk to each other, don't they?
I felt like they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similar thinking people only after dark?
Should I change into a labourer and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me developed as a cleansing of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who sat at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for its provincialism and pettyness, and for its inclination to Marxist-deterministic views of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to travel from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unaccompanied metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of a dream mood.
Even my communist friends have always had the perfect way to do it.
His sneezing eyes narrowed.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional endurance deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, put pressure on me and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in complete seriousness declared that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was red in the cold inside, I admitted that my parents "washed my brains out" and called them "old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career has been smothered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I jumped inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and intoxication in the educational institution.
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers came, but which also to this day hides behind the undeserving reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentine is more elegant than fame.”
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascalova, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszo and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host the exhibition of Valentin Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until March 3, intersperses private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the simple ridge from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian smithereens".
Having a royal family is not a bad thing.
"They at least don't stick a handful of cigarettes in a great carpet, as some great pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszova.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy plenty of elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.”
Valeria Mazzova presents Valentina
The designer’s charisma is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazzo.
“It’s been many years since we went to him for dinner after a tour of Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he radiated and was to feel his spirit.
Everyone who was invited by him could feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It will never come out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Overview of the birth
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been rebuilt on a special seventy-meter long passage that offers a change of roles: the visitor changes to the model and walks through the passages to observe the "visitor" of dreams, which he has to wear Valentino's masterpieces as a dress, which he has chosen in his dress to dress up Jackie
In the audience, the mannequins appear names such as Sibilla Lucembursk<0xC3><0xA1>, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norsk<0xC3><0xA1>, Rosario Bulharsk<0xC3><0xA1> or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "can't forget about it."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
"I give him a preference over others for his femininity and great love for women because he underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria said.
“I like the colors they use, they brighten up a lot and give a ‘spark’ face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to dress in one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived at the end of the 90s.
“I bought my first Valentine’s Day dress for the occasion at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had dresses with bells, embroidered waist and tops without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not only a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have inside."
The "King" of Fashion
The golden ridge of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Pavel Grecky in 1995.
To create these silk dresses ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter-long towel, it took four months of work and 25 "holes" (as the designer calls his shawl).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the largest authority of specialized printing, these dresses represent the top fashion line of the late 20th century, the "return of clients from a high society".
Valentino’s elitist “savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre” over the years is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour collect as much honor as any of its client's husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, his calm, his adjusted, and his perfect appearance," says Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was wonderful, time left no trace on him.”
When the princess says that...
The Hardest Craft in the World: The Sulphur Carriers in the Area of the Kawah Ijen Volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano gamble with their lives and health when they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living by conquering the sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, each day must be drilled to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and when contact with the air passes into a solid state.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kg, he carries them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which stretches 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for worn-out bearers to step up the turtles, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall apart.
They know that any mishap could cost them a life, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rock of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they make.
When they are up, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been making money since 1960, has never paid more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of raw materials to its employees.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the whitening of sugar.
“Because it normally carries 70 kilograms, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes three hours and is eventually destroyed, but can thus earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this appears to be an negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day is paid and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a carpenter.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as the sire: "I was married to a young woman, and I was married to an old woman, and I was married to a young man.
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases
At 27 years of age, Anto risks his life three times a day in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to collect his tax, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes poorly, still coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than a permanent English language.
This friendly and intelligent young man, who is destined to be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in the hotel, could do the carrier’s job instead.
She shares a dirty wooden tent with other wearers and wakes up every day at two o’clock in the morning, because the sulfur at night keeps pouring out and its characteristic yellow color changes into blue and bright darkness.
Despite the darkness, Anto ventures into the crater and illuminates the path with a small light bulb, which he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry on the shoulder basket with a sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high revenues, the mining of raw materials has not mechanized due to cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to the self-employed, and with such efforts.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography fee, which together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are chosen by the keepers of the natural park from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for livestock, not people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old state-run carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will continue to work “as long as possible” because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here 'cause the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and sticks in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and melts the miners in dense effluents emanating from the volcano, the miners are so assertive that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious that the sneezings from their sneezings
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can weigh as little as 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues pump out 15 tons of sulfur, which three trucks then take a steep road between the bushes to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, while opening a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five sons, he is the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns by downing the cheese.
Time is running out, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Ilyen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans argue that they do not have children, in their careers, stress and cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Let's do our civic duty and make a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but yet — or perhaps precisely because of that — the video was mass-spreading on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local cues like "let's put a buck in the oven" as a joke about the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to point out the problem in a funny way with this ad.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency’s artistic director, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill “their civic duty.”
“It’s just about the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a topic that we have to touch.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing we can do, like rap composition, to solve this problem.”
1.2 children
The one who does not weigh too much is the Singaporean government.
Every year, $1,300 will be spent to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and the family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population distribution is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time it exceeded the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family department of the National Population Office, said it was because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People thus have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While the immigration policy has seen efforts to dramatically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the population, it has caused dissatisfaction among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, there is undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year’s Singapore government party recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenue, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate business.
The city development office began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can support the youth lifestyle and reflect developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of developer company EL Developers, claims that their “bot boxes” are sold far faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, and they’re sold in days up to weeks faster than homes with a bigger reason.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, they admit that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Too stressed out.
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a big effect.
“People are still under stress, homes are expensive, as well as education, so a lot of people put it off,” says a young official.
“Let others have children.
But for me, it’s important to rely on your own money and time,” says another, about a 20-year-old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and living costs and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, it’s the Singaporeans who have the last word on setting up a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privately.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or "area of private life, which every person has the right to protect himself from any violation".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet matters that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Journalists from elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be “somewhat personal” and “username and password” in the case of a social network.
“I wouldn’t disclose my biggest secret,” says 10-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret, my mom might know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
“On FB I give nice photos or photos of how we play.
I also talk to my friends there.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude photos or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I have set up a Twitter account so that I can express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just give them there," he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicating with friends,” she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he doesn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and at the last mentioned network he admits he doesn’t know 20 people from his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them pointed him at anything, nor did he want his address or phone number.
“If they insist on me or demand it from me, I’ll simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These guys aren’t strangers to what’s now called cyberbullying.
"They blackmailed a friend on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
According to Jose, the victim did not report from the account.
"You just activated a private mode."
It then explains a series of steps on how to set up an account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish pictures of his acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course, I would do it if someone was cheating on me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
The Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in the field of Education and Education, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented in social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks emerged, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academician Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to learn them, and yet we are only learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, “because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature.”
Also, to be – as far as the environment is concerned – thoughtful, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences.”
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is, is to ask questions that force them to think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also mentions some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you did to a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag people in the photos from the party, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: Do you constantly need to know what you’re doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the internet environment just like outside of it.
These are the same rules.
“A person outside the internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be on social media,” he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand the pros and cons of each, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences that setting up an account on the Internet can have.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
The Guardian is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
The Summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Peru today ended without the issuance of a Declaration from Lima, which was notified and allegedly signed by seven current presidents.
The EFE agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur, but representatives of the foreign ministry and the presidential offices, who initially determined that the document will be published at the end of the summit, will be posted at a later date.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantay Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "confidential sitting, the transmission of sound is prohibited".
A small amount of information that the journalists had at their disposal was provided by the press of some of the governments that were present, but not by the Peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of the presidents, which prompted the disapproval of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
The Peruvian presidential office later e-mailed a "final statement" from the summit, but it was only President Humala's statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, although the press was urgently required.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that broadcasts were provided to all journalists, but they completely prevented the supply of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with Chile and Peru agreeing to a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which settles the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru’s President Olanta Humala and Chilean President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin Monday by hearing the defense talks of both sides to discuss the dispute that has begun with Sanguli.
“We will examine and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are debating today at this international court,” President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice will be subject to the decision was published after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its subjugation to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled that the Marines, the Marines, and the Marines, had been ordered to surrender.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the appeal of then-President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning talks and closing the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, UNASUR member countries will take “significant steps towards the goal in the form of South American citizenship, for which the residence agreements are extended.”
He said that action is being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, “the economic consolidation [of Latin America] does not have to be a winning substance, but it is to serve to expand our productivity and show our people a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," he said in a statement.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the cross-sections of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concern a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none of them are excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I can tell President Ortega that we are conducting the negotiations in the most civilized and comprehensive way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the then president Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>i Nieta.
As part of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn to integrate from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the UNASUR member countries support.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community must be achieved, however, there are still backward regions that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
Among other things, the President of Ecuador said he agreed with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states would be reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights would be questioned.
“Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States," Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said in a reference to political asylum provided by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time “there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be released to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judge, who asked him to undergo a hearing in Swedish territory because of the alleged sexual offence, while "his own Swedish legislation allows him to conduct the hearings with a videoconference speech, which could be echoed in the grand jury.
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since our embassy, but the embassy has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
“But he’s in danger of worsening his physical and mental state because he’s locked in a small space with no chance of moving in the fresh air.
It would mark the health of everyone," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of the authorization that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European Courts, and highlighted by the emphasis that
“We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n leads a series of proceedings at various European courts,” he said.
He said that "if the UK will issue a pass tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, how smoothly the legislation there allows and how it has been implemented in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be brought to an end."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he definitely does not tolerate "subordinateness, wrong intentions, and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
“We are not the greatest enemies of free press, we are the ones who will betray and overthrow politicians, we are the bad journalists in the services of profit, pressure and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither the journalists, nor the bankers, nor the hegemony of the country, nor the bourgeoisie, are in control of Ecuador, and suggested that if re-elected, he would "continue with the changes led by the right way and by the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain Paraguay's veto on membership of the Unasur union at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and puchism entrenched in legality".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he considers it "quite appropriate" to wish his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the time after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Niguys.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
“It’s a problem between South and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be widely assessed in order to be overcome and there was an opportunity to move forward."
He also expressed hope in settling the maritime border dispute, which he is dealing with at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international tribunal if both countries commit to take a verdict, whatever the circumstances may be."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
“I have never been much interested in power, but such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same for me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says President Chavez went on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the state of the president’s health,” he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian state attended today the sixth summit of the head of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a flash of lightning hit me," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "relief a little bit", but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness to his own thighs and began to inform himself of it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little chance of treatment, and more stigma.
At the time, neither the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) said goodbye, “because he had a severe wound.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused damage to the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the onset of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, the disease "means a great success that the length of life of the patient, who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate way, is not the same as in healthy people, the disease is the same as in the disease, the disease is the same as in the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease, the disease
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of CD deficiency of patients with leprosy, lymph nodes, lymph nodes, lymph nodes, lymph nodes, and lymph nodes.
Simply put, this means that the person diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems for up to 75 years while adhering to treatment," the doctor explained in an interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth noting that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the year of the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that patients have been diagnosed with AIDS since the discovery of AIDS.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by May of this year, 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
- Why do people continue to die from the consequences of the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted supplies of the drug. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, i.e. in the late stage of the disease."
Adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when there is already an associated infection. The only thing to do in order to be able to more affect the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease early, and therefore it is necessary to avoid a large scale on a person
In his proposal, the specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco agree, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests in a private laboratory just because he did it with his friend, and despite his low-grade cough, he was able to do so.
“Everything will change if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather get settled three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercising, taking medication.”
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who took the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to celebrate the World Day of the Dead.
"Let them take tests. If they risk, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who investigates information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we were given one or two before, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists, and health care professionals who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested changing this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not only be behind the counters, but the hundred, let it be in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“This is not a support for promiscuousness.
Nor is it a matter of “paying beer and motel,” as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
There is no such thing as sexuality. The best thing is to make condoms available to those who are already leading a sexual life," he said.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This is Mexico’s fourth-highest number in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th place in HIV-related cases.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% is perinatal, and 2% is perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease in one recorded case.
The judgment passed by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt set by the competition in Mexico, sets a clear precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, it appears that the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of a judgment issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hal at the North Texas Competition Court leaves in practice a Mexican company without defending against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court, the main Mexican glass producer, with an appeal against three inconsistencies.
First of all, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the insolvency law of the United States, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceedings determine the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law, which arbitrarily determines the organization of the American Law Institute, was created.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the vote of the branches of the internal business structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Competition Institute was responsible.
In addition, it is true that even after the votes were counted, the creditors – who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the “supplement” funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool Limited – would not have reached a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This statement of appeal does not appear before the Court of First Instance.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sady is appealing for a new assessment directly at the referring court, so that the assessment is conducted for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If it fails here, it will require a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States, as a remedy.
In the case, it is serious that the court has omitted the document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae, in which the procedure of Vitro is described in detail under the Competition Act and in which it is pointed out that the company has eased itself by resorting to conciliation agreements.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall Ratings
Without noticing, the criminal notice of the Mexican Aviation Departments against the former owner of Gaston Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rrag Andradem, who was charged with fraudulent conduct, was on the table for several months, and according to the pilots’ organization, the vessel has already passed.
The proceeding, led by Carlos Diaz Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit with the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by the entrepreneur, in which he selected 198 million pesos from the bank IXE of the fideicomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most likely directed towards the purchase of shares in the Professional Management of Hotels (Administrator Profesional de Hoteles).
As we know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met at the Universidad de Caribe on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from a “land with a big wall” focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies in the lower part.
Previously, the Canacintra (C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to stand against a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the affair with the ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the Government did not consider in question, and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known as the ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Institute of Industrial Property)
As is well known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debt and not affect those short-term, Homex puts 500 million pesos of investment certificates on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest payments every 28 days.
He was born competitive.
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet resulted in an association called Competitive, whose goal will be the software services market in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, a world-class basketball player, has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has been processing the entire world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was before he was linked to a brain dead body in 2008 on a wheelchair, burned into the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of the junior categories, player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, president of the national basketball team.
"I've stayed in a lot of roles throughout my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled, recalling 50 years of visiting reporters at the Bayer newspaper.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, prove it.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest movement of all the guards, those that remind of his performance in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he simultaneously celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed it the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as an owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At the time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, telling me, ‘I have a grown two-meter player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to play Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory in the championship, then Gauss will contribute to the next.”
The championship, when Gauss enjoyed playing for the Los Vaqueros team, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already serving as president of the basketball federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifying Olympic Games in Mexico in 1989,” he said.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final innings," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup men's team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we smashed the United States squad, which was quite similar to the one that blew the bronze at the World Cup.
The men had not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramona Rivase, Fica L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and Picul<0xC3><0xAD>na (Ortiz), but also the youths (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers of Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in a race in 1990.
The men’s team, which may not have had the perfect composition but has managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the men’s Olympic qualifier in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the record such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded due to a tie at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers from the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such a level of results as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Not to mention his performance in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best goalkeeper coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
When I was young, I loved the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your biggest success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national men's team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league had up to 17 men's in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
These were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the guys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
That's what I'm looking forward to.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandkids and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, famously starred as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a man who acted recklessly and was intimidating and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died on Friday afternoon of complications associated with cancer, according to an official announcement from the family that the Associated Press provided to the Dallas-based production company Warner Bros..
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved the most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day.
“Linda Gray, who was his wife’s representative in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in a Dallas hospital,” said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life fully,” said Linda Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman starred on television as a decent guy in the lighthearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (gian) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His acting in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it wasn’t until Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to the star-studded peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to trigger expectations regarding the work of full emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations around the world, but also the risking of millions of dollars in bribery offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in follow-up.
The November 1980 episode, in which the response was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment series in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which watched 50 million viewers.
His brother-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) was shot on J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an impassioned comedian with a charismatic smile: a greedy businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a treatment room.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone who was "great on and off the court".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second series have already been completed and the sixth has just been turned," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or the TNT station on how the series would continue.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York City, and then in 1952 to 1956 served in the Air Force in England.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't give anything there that I knew could hurt or hurt someone," he told the Press Association.
After liver transplantation, he began to devote himself to the promotion of organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital, where he helped combat patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a bit uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the “end of the world”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the “long number” of May’s calendar, which is due to come on December 21, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a budget failure that some call the "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict Israel is engulfed in, a place where Christians say they are theorizing the world.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When one considers what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember that bad means bad for apocalyptic thinking good.
And that’s not the only professor who offers courses on “the end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, a professional assistant Barry Vacker holds a course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
“We’re discussing why these ideas expand over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,” says Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional assistant in the history of art and anthropology, came together to arrange a course called End of the World.
“We don’t connect to ‘2012’ because we always count on the ability to re-organise the course in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "threat of destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work “until the eve of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It's been extended to two hours," Restall said of his course for students with a high average of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester we received an e-mail asking if there was still room.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour before when it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no educated student, namely the professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prediction and in a way we’re going to reverse it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that dates back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations has been caused by the Internet.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
This is the case in most of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew of any course on “the end of the world,” he answered quickly.
"The Philippines will not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, pointing to the exception at the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period.
Dates are taken on a light weight by students and professors.
Several of them said they intend to go to the “end of the world” celebration.
“I think I’ll call a couple of friends to laugh together,” said a 20-year-old communications student named Samira Ford.
