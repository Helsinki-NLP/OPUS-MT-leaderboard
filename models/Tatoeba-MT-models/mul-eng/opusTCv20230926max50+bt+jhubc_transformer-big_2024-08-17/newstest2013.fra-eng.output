A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-Election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has grown since the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election, and withdraw citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
That's a lot more.
Students, who are considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011 Republican lawmakers sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have reduced the voter turnout rate in 2010 by 17 per cent compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of state voters.
The same goes for Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on and they see it as a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant?
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, that European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting rather, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are accurately determined.
I still recommend that you take the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should go through it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many of them are also completely unexplainable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very detrimental to people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer," they added.
L'alimentation
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs boson decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole emotion, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it’s still not entirely certain that it’s a Higgs thing.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let's suppose it's the Higgs anyway, since the odds of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's all about.
In this lower world, there is a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it has, too, a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consists in a large way.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the boson in Higgs would appear.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, aren't all beasts as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific location, somewhat like a rock launched into a pond.
From this "derangement" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, to this difference near that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a little like a frozen pond whose only very large rock could ride the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN’s – the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometer ring! – to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon, hold) don’t.
Now, what can they “bring in” all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any gap between MS observations and predictions.
In fact, there are many who wish to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and close some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-oops!).
But no such differences have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impact of these researches on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Keep in mind: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They were looking for scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, though not at all its original intention, now serves as a "look" at all the digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Devotion tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The cancer of the prostate that was gnawing at him had left him a two-year respite.
“They had given me five years to live, I’ve been seven years,” he said, half-witted half-rain, lying in bed at Victor-Gadbois’ palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the night before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Trapped in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to the strangers who deal with him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
“During our lives, we learn that a man is standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept regression, he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “conscious and suffocated”.
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she added.
“I have no more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that she is put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the coming days, for a final visit from her son who came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are provided with body care and food aid.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Upon death, we will agree to provide oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, upon request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help our loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Along with a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the court, quietly in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” Dr Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec’s health care that scares several doctors specializing in palliative care into adopting a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed with palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists sneeze on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard’s expectations of survival were already low when she gave up on trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me that I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal-based palliative care company, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors then often resort to palliative sedation, which goes back to sleeping the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unsatisfactory patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the malfeasances related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to retreats.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party funding and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” some refractively reiterating their instincts to touch a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he added, hoping that it can "demonstrate the strata behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers from the “Marteau squad” who, since 2009, have led Montreal’s “cartel des <0xC3><0x89>outs” to put the soft pedal on the inflatable contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly packed wine jars in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineering at the Montreal track and of Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who reversed the money in Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito sowed at all levels, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also claimed to have organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for sewers with which it inflates the costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, detailed it well in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and wineries totaling $736,000, in exchange for contracts he went through.
Other officials of the railroad admitted to having their foot greased by inflating the bills from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cashiers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected officials to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the borough of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of money is wasted in election campaigns
The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, says she “shoots on a wire to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrong ones.”
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would take a separate investigation unit in Montreal and a day before, so as not to see the dubious practices come back.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected to know the stratagem", when they did not plunge into the mahogany!
Estimated at 70% the share of dirty money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 but that will not change the donation, according to him: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and party financing: "One cannot go lower; going deeper things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I step by their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I don't get burned.
From my beginnings at the Clairefontaine INF pre-training centre to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced through stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Yeah, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hopping clubs.
He played alongside some great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable conversation with him.
I was out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as a leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th of the final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive during the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning this title.
Last season, we didn't go very far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us in terms of what’s been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect most.
You can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the League of Champions, we have proved that we can answer those who are present.
Look at Manchester City who haven’t managed to qualify for the 8th final in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
Looking at the sums invested, you could imagine 15 points ahead of the game!
It was to ignore our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have a smile telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking it.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
It's better to say that there's a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he sets a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of League 1.
He has shown everywhere that he’s gone that he’s a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from making fun of my playing time.
I saw things there, and I stepped out of it.
Today, I am able to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned the lessons of what has happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What are your thoughts on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had reached his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) drawn on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced a similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary, current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, after reaching a $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) peak in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around $10 (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress into a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes trade back).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and deals with exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, spread throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner of which, as a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then inextricably linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any change would change the imprint.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to one hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides opportunities for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weightlifters such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant soldiers” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a textbook on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, such as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored personnel carriers reached Kabul without being attacked, overrun by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban airstrikes on Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and with blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overrun by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into business, seizing government lands to resell them into land to build the income refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They have lost their minds; most of them have not fought on their own.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American latitudes: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the TV, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized, strong presidential power, abolishing the position of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been relaunched, no dam is in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take care of it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the immense Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
It will also take a while for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of coinciding aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, led, and carried out many works by a small French NGO of interest
These works, gourmets in local labour, were able to help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmable areas.
What will we remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local, very harsh living conditions in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency by foreign groups, what the farmers told me they wanted, a small amount of civil aid, well controlled and directly affecting them, should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution for Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its go-all.
Taking everyone to court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given two more months to this Assembly to complete its work.
It has been almost two years since Egypt relied on a provisional text, several times amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "teach his word" and "preach the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time obliging the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with U.S. weekly Time.
As much as this use of an early vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Whether you vote for my text or I keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, largely Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, considering they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added in a hurry, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Some commentators have also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day has been expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the constituent’s pendulum was misplaced.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Objections of all attention, Article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the principal source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the “establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals reply, which sees only one shot of communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular as regards the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because "people called upon to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms employed borrow from the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question might in the future be how competent the civil judges are to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No longer will the trials of civilians be banned in military courts, as demanded by human rights associations.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
Blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular, the press.
In addition, there is no longer any issue of women’s protection, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy sites, the center of the world and a sea of samurai await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has chosen five great reasons to travel to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourself indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptized backgrounds" will be touched by Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was at this precise place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers walk along the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the presbytery), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Onion and to the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words there, accompanied by prayers, which are then fulfilled.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
It is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is not possible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel-Aviv Museum of Art.
Mainly exhibited are the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moldings of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which dates back to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
Shiny stars.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21<0xC2><0xB0> while that of air can reach 23<0xC2><0xB0>.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come here to carry out treatment based on salt water, lemon, healing mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married people who have come to take photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances. The theatre is now used for the opera.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equal to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk in the high air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These felines love passing places and do not refuse to be regaled.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists went to Promise Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing over what the law will give for the mandatory language test, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to undergo a Russian examination.
At the moment, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sector.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his linguistic knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only citizens of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of education prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Profit, Negative Attitude and Protection of Rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to give?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service say, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross over dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and between 12 and 12 hours of paper.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“With them, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they don’t touch the intended salary,” said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to earn money in Russia trust that they know not only the language of the country in which they wish to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would be a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to feed their children without talking about properly dressing them and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start making money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and fainted."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language-related law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work afterwards.
Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, one can get a false record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
“They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,” Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajikistani national, told reporters.
“Make haste, do not be lazy, and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Counterfeit papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination task had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper boots".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the exam at first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the holders of civilian weapons.
Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it was the shootings carried out during the weddings or the killings organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit by passing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that amendments to the gun law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by “squeezing the screw”.
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, you can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are in the number of five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking command of weapons
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals by law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are weapons stolen from police stocks as well as those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these people have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered on purpose to hide the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, gun manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow weapons into the black market, especially in Moscow,” says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large part of the guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is local, sometimes artisanal production, a mafia has formed and is organizing the supply,” the former military said.
Where do the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found “because of the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from "extreme excavations".
A seller and consultant of an armory who asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for 900 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> per unit with two chargers," he says.
“It’s true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like in a luxury store "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a "coin" to trade.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American punches with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won’t give it to him.
Young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military veteran Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he says, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was “everything we want”.
“I believed in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I am not satisfied with buying, we go with the seller in the forest and install a target.
“I get shot and when I’m convinced that the gun is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
The search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
“It’s enough to have a precise amount of money,” it says in an advertisement on the site “Buy a gun or a combat machine gun.”
Users leave their requests there and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of fake sites and has taken away people who want to buy combat weapons.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," says the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of fake sites and has taken away people who want to buy combat weapons.
“People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia,” he said.
A Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
You will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes decreased by 7% in Russia and amounted to 22.9 miles while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8 percent.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take off or blow up quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist associations.
In parallel to the increase in the modest salaries of basic employees at Walmart and in the fast food chains, the organizers of the events want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, "Black Friday", at a time when a pouring rain of sales taking over millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggered landslides.
That day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, quit their job to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid employees at Walmart do their shopping only in their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded an increase in wages, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 an hour, it’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists at Berkley University of California show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer all the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8pm to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
His cashiers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
The company’s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the left-wing Huffington Post that in all “less than five” Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a “com’s operation among so many others” by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they’re not much appreciated, that’s why they’re not yet established) but McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but little, on average, its core employees hit New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this amount in New York.
It was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protestors of a union by bribes or layoffs.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, taking over fast food is still a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous events were taking place near several other fast-food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions!" and after they do not even give you the job you don't hurt.
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that “we all need to support fast food workers so they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, not counting that all were not fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult at the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For the time being, we can only averagely deceive the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it turns out from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by gesture.
What does the future hold for us as well?
- Although the Kinect made the physical interaction, many things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on really 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice command?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
One cannot say that it is panacea: the question of privacy arises because one does not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not large gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-carved bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that it?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen on to you?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is about the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction between man and machine.
I would really need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem.
Or improvise it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here’s what I think: the best option would be a “transitional” augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you’re the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses won’t allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible than Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
- In my courses, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the tips of the finger.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
To make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below on which it will still take a long time to get into trouble: the way to make believe someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of running mats (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs as well).
For the time being, we can only averagely deceive the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The kingdom of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The St. Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the cities that are in advance, at the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that one can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the festivals and festivity.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds, no matter where they are.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I knew it was my way.
So the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, like me, were misunderstood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pouchkinskaya-10, which before the works housed a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy-to-play songs in rolling jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, a modern-day composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did a lot of programming before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboidov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was called Painter of the Year, and it was then that my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new age with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's afraid to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory dress.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to suck him in the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary, a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Someone other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of the culture is taking place.
Before, people were shared in herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denials another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's the people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it’s less management, money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the grievor of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are dismissed, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
At present, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Asleep in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with on-board landers set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how do we continue to make our species live in distress or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that one can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg Astronomical State Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, caillet eggs were sent into space to see how a weight-bearing embryo was developing.
At the exit, a perfectly normal chick is obtained.
It is then that the problems begin.
“The problem is that the puppy has to find support, he has to get on his feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
Unable to find any support, the chicks behaved in a disorderly manner.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We closed their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin affair.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not realized for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has the most value.
Our sheep flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered that question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space officer.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnologies, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: a mandatory step in the preparation for flight.
Here, in zero flotability, cosmonauts are trained at extra-vehicular exits.
The water imitates the weight.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but still a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby moves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid in her mother’s stomach, it is easier for her to get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from its birth until its first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weightlifter is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
As a weightlifter, the muscles of the stomach, the basin atrophy very quickly, the baby's pushing capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth’s attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unfit," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute for Public Finance Control) said: "The control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the forefront of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what’s missing from us,” Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection conducted by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system approach by Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to infect entrepreneurs with controls; is this allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority in charge of inspecting the law from requiring compliance,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice proper to it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and of better quality", yet, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the implementation of the law itself.
In what can this project help you in concrete terms and what does it result for you?
A common control of this type should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those looking for flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof works there which is organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a degree of nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has courses of this type at the level of the different L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to our state resources.
The public funds managed by our regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the public procurement law, as an institution, meant for you, has its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do back-to-back checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument to "detect the risks of mismanagement" with which we have been exposed to nearly 14,000 public procurements - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of procedures have been changed.
Do you, therefore, consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was forcing the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look at where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG was not going to infect entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing was going to happen.
The market law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be performed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is missing from us.
The roads are in freezing places, but most remain viable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by freezing and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 <0xC2><0xB0> and -10 <0xC2><0xB0> C but they should rise slightly in the day.
The snowfalls stopped in the region and there remains only a thin layer of snow in the plains.
The crests of the Metallic Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service show that, due to the fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 motorway and the national roads of the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains on, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
It still remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remains and in places filled by traffic.
Especially in areas located at altitudes, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of verglas and that snow layers sprinkled with traffic can be found on roads in mountainous areas and located at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risks of glass formation in the Pardubice area at altitudes.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on the departmental and third class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow covered by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with possible cloudy periods.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and +1 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in some places, it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and -9 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication channels can be by freezing places.
Drivers can expect to pass through foggy areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to operate, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-category pathways are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the areas of the Olomouc region at altitudes today have to rely on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" hill and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after chemical processing operations.
The snowfall that night forced road maintenance personnel to make their way to the field; according to the services in charge of the track, it fell more than three centimeters in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district.
In other parts of the region, most of the pavements are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k must expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick and soft snow," the head of road maintenance services in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the district of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k also went to the site during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are easily accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forested areas with wet remaining pavements.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the maintenance services of the Northern Bohemian roads have reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or verglas, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and therefore snow and verglas should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowfall during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
There are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that curve under the weight of the snow until reaching the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "Together, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our The Tap Tap group, we laugh at it rather and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you are planning a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the time when the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, will end on a 12-hour time zone in advance of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I thought it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled " End of the Cancelled World " (in Czech " Konec v<0xC4><0x9B>da zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard during these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point as part of a live, entirely unique, Czech television broadcast.
The lyrics to this song were written by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on as part of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap association, and for the last six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands of music and performers perform on stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you have the choices?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it at first.
We have five members in electric chair whose equipment must travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been going pretty well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitude towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still inaccessible to people with disabilities; there is not yet a current that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet see it as evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
In what ways do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common out there that a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists.
For the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost some control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It’s true, creating connections with well-known singers and actively working on promoting the band helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can, in addition, allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it’s logical: everything that’s new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural.
But mercy is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take in mercy.
They are people who can live a life of their own and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it’s not just an advance for them but for the whole of society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A Seoul, La<0xC3><0xB0>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the Cancelled World" is sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (of CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entrance is free for children up to 12 years, pre-sale tickets are open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of agency projects.
The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The development of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major proponent of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many works devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a proponent of world-renowned astronomy, his contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
In 1925, a drizzle was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the drizzle.
The only known information about this drain is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzy.
These two projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautze).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problem, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronaut Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the international Astronaut Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-stage tests of the RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of engines was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later are still to be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities as well as national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital allied to a frenzied financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (salaries) generate a tension on prices.
The following meaning should be given to this term: a producer strives by importing low-priced goods to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a larger share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, either to buy at a low price, or to disappear; the result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no social responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the state necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known to the public that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictation of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot support their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive wages such that the state is forced to pay a surcharge in order for them to reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to invest capital in a country with wages of misery, at sea.
The following question must be asked: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, to get rid of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
One must then wonder whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not, according to its own selfish interests, direct politics and by the same means, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all states.
As a result, a desperate situation manifests itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the drafting of bills to law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills were then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
The punches of wine, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption were proliferating without limits and the people were going to the elections with already-sold votes." ... "The honest people were not looking in any way to get jobs, it resulted once the state remained a 'consultant', but it was a difficult thing to say that the situation was going on and that the
In conclusion, as in ancient times, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
This results, as in the past, in an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we witness today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international and internal European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can,” Sting says in the song entitled Fragile, whose main refrain is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of repeated killings; in short, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "behind the curtain" perspective on the one to which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first press agency (Reuters) to end the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries where they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of the Ka-fi only 4, after the overthrow of the Ka-fi regime).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central bank at the Bank of America of the Rothschilds and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (government, I mean well) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single religion, and to create only a single one of them.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid that crises such as those caused in 1907 are not repeated).
After successfully triggering the First World War by the assassination of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the crushing of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany pharaohs war reparations, thus generating the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses (it was then enough for them to put up a dowry)
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
Balfour’s above-mentioned statement laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if all he had done was planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis of acceptance.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel ignited a fire house that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people divide entrenchedly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong generates another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of everything, one finds the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we have to make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, international bankers offer people elections only to their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist world politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, who could, due to the accession of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.)
In the words of David Rockefeller in 1994, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
"Let all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves be compelled to bear a mark on the hand or forehead with the red iron, so that he may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has good sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
That number means man, and that's six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempted release of hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States aroused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated peripheries, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rock-and-roll cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team who came to make footage for the shooting of a science-fiction feature film.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines took note of this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is on the part of a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen.
The ambiences follow: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retranscripted in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has successfully restarted his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected stage director and his acting game ceased to evoke ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film not to take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a story page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Bazaar of Tehran).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered only a few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It turns out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of a crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite shot by the shooters).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it shows itself with moderate interest, appreciating the 1970s production and retro style.
He leads the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the matter.
Rules for Inflating Balls, Bananas and Circus
The www.bankovnipopaltky.com server, which conducts a public inquiry every year on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the settlement or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
“The fact that the EU has been considering, in recent times, a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision,” the survey’s organiser, Patrik Nacher, told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Up to now, however, women have been at the forefront of life insurance rates because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea so incredible of "the EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of direct or substantial quantities of mercury.
Criticisms have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "pepper butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-uniform national standards that complicated trade.
Standards on fruits and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that should include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American investigation that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of death of children by drowning.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 for the purpose of blowing in fair trumpets.
We, too, have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let's Fair" association of liberal economists, the Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organisers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have seas handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said Jaroslav Palas, Minister of Agriculture of the time (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that because of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the communes by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were to be used, in concrete terms, to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Bizarre regulations are rare".
While the regulations often cause criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as in its overall development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions in the Czech Republic.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only cane sugar alcohol-based products, and not beet sugar-based products, can bear the name rum.
Today, the official list of registered products in the EU includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, L<0xC3><0xBC>beck massepain or Parme ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary") and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xBD> and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carpes.
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice's Cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, declares Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been plundered for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, then I try to come up with a solution for it to change.
And since I'm over forty years old and I'm an independent member of no party, I have no other choice but to run in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I’ve always said that I’ll start in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate election.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected as a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we snore at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we snore at those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition to this, the press breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I sold the journalists or that I was Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek's advisor.
Let's go to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To do this, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I put pressure on tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained a cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or right with a good project, it is consciously refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of the right or of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it’s a little left or right, it’s not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that they bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have some optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about them.
But without the support of Parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then perhaps explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president with direct suffrage, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without hesitation, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I've just started out in politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work out, I'm going to stop in six years and I'm going back to the private sector.
It is as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can’t make a difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also run in the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who has revealed oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
In spite of everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if every potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate at about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but do not want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Do I have to hang myself?
I've already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program doesn’t attract much interest.
I have no obligation to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live in it, for example, paying my son’s English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run in any elections.
Are you going to continue your business in order to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities to the test?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the edition of the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va on Saturday.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
“I think this building is fun, it’s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the street’s side.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large neighboring company, tells us, “Yes, it’s really nice, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes to one of these rigged libraries at all, right?
Spijkenisse, a charming city that has nothing to do with the doors of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons back to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back on the statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV office of architects, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mind-blowing and often cynic buildings, accepted the project with his usual phragm and presented himself at the competition in 2003 with five pounds under the arm and a wink on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, puzzled and raising their shoulders, Maas, the embattled, stacked his choice books in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common dear!"
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain collapsed.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some Mitoyen buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small, tender town, which to this day had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall with a loudness, whose white fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades invite to think that they house a dairy, has enriched itself with an architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you as you browse the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the floor in Dutch bricks and elegant reverberators speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and little girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library beams are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Maas.
We have completely altered the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been neatly furnished: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black ray of the library, which are sometimes lambries, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of one millimeter thick have been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and you save time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us an amazing view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and potted figs.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is located under a glass bell, the sun only lights up the interior for a short time, even on beautiful weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sunblock, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds charge for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “finally found soul.”
A few weeks ago, in fact, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet fully furnished (today, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, a US-EU relations expert, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status from the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are on a number of fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still working to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has major openings in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention during important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will no longer be respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Are opinions different between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene in the United States.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course, the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, this is not the case.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a wider political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro area.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Is Germany playing a leading role on the international stage, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or does she still have trouble taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to compose with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if it’s unpleasant and they’re just less appreciated, it’s life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name lies a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win the case.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying themselves, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a folder containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna brand DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by owning part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: its agents charge him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of justice are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the world’s third fastest growing luxury product market.
However, it is not easy to remove dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW of the BMW logo. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have spent last year in an "emergency situation in the course of work to a found normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type were reported to have been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office had reported 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Indeed, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because family names can’t be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, president and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichois' objection.
Freudenberg certainly won a case against the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is put
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, trialing and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs; the archive service has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even unsuccessfully proposed to the opposing party a "big six-figure euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s why we see what it represents for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler added: "The vigilance is on."
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather “register also in China everything that is likely to be protected,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Tapping, Singing, Helping
Choral Imbongi repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, one taps on the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, scorpions for ladies and moccasins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they conquer, envelop and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come, from genetics in human medicine to humans at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorister has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "story teller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one can speak commonly the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometres by bird flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people with disabilities
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or earth huts and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that make Swaziland worse: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carriers of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is absolutely no perspective.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since dealt almost professionally with Esitjeni's AIDS orphans.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
The common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and gale belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups involved?
Syphilis and blennorrage often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men results in at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhage and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are seen in this group.
In young people, a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections was observed than in other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of the genitals, urinary pains, white losses, low-ventricular pain, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners to undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the choristers collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
“In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estijeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well accommodated, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, so called the old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school on a daily basis in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has a person is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, for even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that touches sexuality.”
It is rather curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned morals, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found on every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to somewhat promote cultural exchange, the Choirs of Imbongi travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the inhabitants of the tip of the Black Continent still know the art of time.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good mood and joy, but also sometimes tears away with a few hideous border guards.
The bus always takes them to Estijeni, where the choristers visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of those choristers who tap their feet in the Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e rehearsal room, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercure
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains ice water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently submerged in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the lead scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements came to life in other regions of the solar system.
Undetected by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-borns" in the universe's birth room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, named "W5", a rather unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the glowing glow of a dying star.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, also known as "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope adds more value to the colors.
In this infrared photo, the nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Verseau.
His resemblances to a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest mysteries in astronomy is the creation of Saturn’s rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three dust shards divide the shining heart of the star's birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the first of a cosmic carambola in the constellation of the Snake: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern wheel of fire".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was created from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the circle of black holes, which is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies named Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly birth always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with bright rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capability is approaching those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radio Telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the computing power of their machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world.
They planted two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A giant new telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope is to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercure’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is an eclectic romanticism.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus caots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, one would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, about which we do not know much, if it is that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
“Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world,” Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
One can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov seems more than doubtful.
“He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” Fatulayeva says.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have still conceived a daughter.
Would Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about man in the great Central Asian age.
"Surprisely elderly people also live in some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum’s director, thinks it’s a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh’s high-calorie meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cenemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor next to a deck, from which she beats the content relentlessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two young children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical glasses in the form of a belly.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are hidden long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly Retirement Is Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took command.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-eyed son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The Sharia-based draft constitution is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president is not averse to words full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and the lay people.
For all the members of the confused and hopelessly disillusioned opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily written by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tour are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists are using the vague formulation and margin of legal maneuver that stems from it to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia.
In any case, it is because of a newly introduced article that states that, with regard to all subjects related to sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the country's most important Islamic institution and its brilliance radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to judicial oversight.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts used to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also, one can read in the draft, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
In addition, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation suggesting that it is forbidden to “offend people”.
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
There are therefore many points to be interpreted in the draft which Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
“The revolution was born again.”
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord on Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabahi, who came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to throw in the trash of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to promote a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he proclaims the referendum, we go to his palace and we will overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, asserting that “the Qur’an [was] their constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and strong.
According to them, now is the time to let the people decide by the ballots of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamists will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That’s why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda laments.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: “You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control.”
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the appetite of locals for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-soaked trout and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can take up to a year.
When the dark settles and it gets cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people avalate small pieces of fish and stick to a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it’s not bad – it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in air-tight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, in the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and – no doubt with the senses softened by alcohol – eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though smelling, element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to his dismay.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in hand.
As you say, we are cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the ropes of its stock market tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and I make the tail to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of the fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
One would believe in the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
The traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, results that are owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very crowded and tentative state that encloses the capital. On its preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once paved and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We rely on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and Pena Nieto’s party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without power failure, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, it’s not always the image people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious there.
In a devastated area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that at best he failed to address the problem of killing women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this impoverished neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the cadaver stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commer, a troublemaker, a mourner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he'll be as good as he was when he was governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counteract the claims of mistreatment that Bradley Manning would have been the victim of incarceration.
The trial involves Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed numerous occasions to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered during his detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, have not revealed his complaint.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defense filed a request requiring the Manning case to be classified on the ground that the kidnapping was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified during his will.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein and Manning examined the forms that officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein spoke about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned her about her prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
“They wrote ‘no problems’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any problems,” Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the Special Committee which had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating an "injury risk".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marines' base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the brightest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also pointed out that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he was to release his cover which might have hidden his nudity, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to release her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty of the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the heads of indictment are retained, he undergoes criminal incarceration for life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He said many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing which line to turn.
I grew up in downtown California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they say “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they say “Italian.”
Then, I became "Mexican-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the land that saw my grandfather born, there was no need for special qualification or union trait.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" file.
I thought about that moment of the week when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender in writing half of their territory to the top of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for battle.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to discuss the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, poorly educated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they tease us as if we were individuals of a lower strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while living in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican-Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Besides, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that absolutely needs to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to deal with it yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrel, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is void.
While the same futile arguments persist to find out who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel-Arroyo, Jl<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>s, J<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>s, and J<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>s.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has all blown up, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly deadlock.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even though the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been running Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has wiped out a crack.
Having killed some of its leaders and repulsed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overpopulated corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over and caused Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas jubilate and say that the Islamist crescent curves around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, passing through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and as far as Jordan, where the allies lead from Hamas.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily exposed to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be ruled out even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system proved to be effective and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has thrived, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fires in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that rages over the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects it from continuing its illegal settlements.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why droll these Palestinian figurines by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they head out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will conquer it; but it is possible that the Arab spring will change it.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help the new Arab governments fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a cease-fire which is good luck -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dustbin that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, short-term and short-term, is that the cease-fire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now aim to end the arms flow to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and one Jerusalem by Jerusalem.
The Arabs of foreign countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state at the UN.
Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets that are all identical, regardless of the brand name
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents’ smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Even though Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would re-launch the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be harmful consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Fakers from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had energized their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship, and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has given up making a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in place of marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions – these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade deals with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I ignore them.
“You take a cigarette and you order the package,” Victor El Hage said as he bought a package featuring a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that’s good, we stop and put the key under the door,” he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child are praising the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The trouble goes back a long way,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of “wanting to do something, but failing to get started in a satisfying activity.”
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What’s at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a murky mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.”
Anxiety can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we get the impression that we are bored when it is actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to a person's story on tape, from behind the scenes.
Some groups heard, from the room next door, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups – they had trouble concentrating, but didn’t know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a challenging or engaging task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, “like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to get bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that when you torturing or scratching, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay in my flight, a speaker with a mono cord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Stage of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Besides the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interest centers that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quickly bullied.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today’s boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescents are a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” especially because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask myself: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets, or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Nutrition is the way the brain has found you to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the U.N.
But the brain doesn’t always know which is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self-control, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just like I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant simmering that generates activities and technology is the goal we should aim at.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but the boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyper-stimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to jump into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could serve his consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without consequence.
Police services have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative counties have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to blame the people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora’s police chief, in eastern Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a licensing system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulation on marijuana, first of all regarding use for therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
Washington’s law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within 30 km around a school, park, playground or creek.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis sale business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the police chief, Oates, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer prosecute persons aged 21 and over who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should "discharge this type of person."
Chief Oates said the police would apply new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney", Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession issues, primarily in order to put pressure on users to detoxify themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed a crime that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized crime,” Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of limited marijuana consumption.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer making adults appear for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to rank all marijuana detention cases without a follow-up.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not an easy task.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the people accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws".
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, they’re struggling to accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While state advocates and representatives envision a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting the federal government’s guidelines, which still envisions the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has primarily allowed marijuana sales businesses for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police aren’t likely to push through the doors to grab small drug bags, there’s a strong bet that they’re opposed to licensed personal marijuana sales businesses authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is given to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was banished and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A.N.Wilson said with fascination that I was gone after being forced to drink in brushed cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and was the subject of constant brawl.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the so-called knowing, I was subjected to racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students are suffering the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to be able to express their views freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to student politics, and which depicted the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who moves to Rolls-Royce, planted a silvery whole and moved with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are centre-rights.
“This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one thinking that way during my first few weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and with paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasms towards the Tory students, but that in addition, they took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on striker miners, from privatisation and government opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim involved a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustular face, easily managed.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
“I suggest you take French classes during your free time — finally, if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said in a harsh tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted on the fact that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This stratagem has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have resumed the refresher.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, didn’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started to take the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained to him why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irrefutable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's for takin' you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a workshop conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the world’s most serious, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Internally blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and treating them as “old fools.”
The rest was short-lived.
It's my father who stabbed the last nail in my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can treat me with wet, pleurisy chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoyed an unshakeable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Seam", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian seamstress.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seamstress recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Seamstress", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high seam models created for his seamstress over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with an inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "the gentleman" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret d'Aster.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the modest seamstress of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We would all love to be invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the charm of the seamstress.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
“With him, every guest felt important and appreciated,” recalls the “top model”, who began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Nobility-Line Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-educated people and with the greatest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor who chose to marry the mane, or the mane, who was wearing the dress.
Among this audience of models, we find names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino’s first clothes are like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "glilette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muse.
“I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty,” added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors it uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can not, nor can she, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
This was finally possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a fly skirt, a draped bust and a décolleté to fall off.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the tailor's evening dresses with "the utmost care, because a evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House’s exhibition is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the seamstress thus calls her seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different types of laces and a four-and-a-half-metre stripe.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Enthralled for years by the "savage" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' spouses.
“His refinement, his calmness, his carefree and perfect look have always caught my eye,” Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”

The Hardest Job in the World: The Human Mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but worn-out bearers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a turtle’s pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents euros for each kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once up there, it takes a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy carts painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little in contrabass at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serve to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what it would win in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the work was not as difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulfur: "I converted to Ja'ales for a young girl from Bali, where he is a young girl, where he is from.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Malnourished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares a measure of unhealthy wood with other wearers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to glow at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Challenging the darkness, Anto descends into the crater with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their account and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one under the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old corporal who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", as he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which, of course, in the thickets of their usual problems, they breathe
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions and extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans take responsibility for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychine in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertisement.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of Christmas, so we felt that it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves: what’s more creative about solving this problem than making a rap song out of it?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to a delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has seen its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters who wish to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give more clear instructions to the promoters, who were previously placed sticks in the wheels if they wanted to propose too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
So much so that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would appear that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it back later,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, while the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" personally and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
“These are very secret, my mother can know them, but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool out,” he says.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he added.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, quickly,” he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will also not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner to him.
The case of Jose, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, for example, music,” he said.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that are known today as cyber-harassment are not foreign to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends has been racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close her account.
"He only spent it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyber-harassment,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, it is they, the children and the young people who were born with technology.
“We, we are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them here, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criterion on whether or not to disclose, publish, or tell at an age where they don’t have the maturity to do so.”
“We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do so is useless,” she says.
Next, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“In the internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social networks,” she says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says it is essential for parents to consciously read the terms of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind the children that it is not necessary to speak to foreigners.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public.
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 delegates present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the closing of the summit, and then posted it on the Internet.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by Peru’s president, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among journalists was given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some confusion among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Country Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it had been requested by the press, it had not issued the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published in March last year.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited as much as possible the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that cuts a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has attempted against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing today before this international court,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country respectful of international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” President Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, handing a hand to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total investment of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, access to the Internet at low prices across South America", and to jointly and effectively assess the risks posed by drug trafficking.
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although it did not provide the most extensive details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that this country’s electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and in good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to revise all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will require a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will address this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were engaged during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has been in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who rebuff our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not betrayed his principles himself, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory regarding an alleged sexual offence while "its own Swedish legislation allows it to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects the health of anyone,” he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a bailout that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the judicial authorities of the European Union.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a series of procedures with different European courts,” he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain gave the bailout as soon as tomorrow, it would be over.”
And if Sweden, as fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he clarified that what he did not tolerate was “the mediocrity, the bad faith, and the lies that harm freedom of expression.”
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or wicked politicians but the bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he was pleased that it was not this kind of journalist " neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, instead of putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Paraguayan veto in Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup d'état disguised", because in reality, "it would destroy the legal system.
What’s more, the Ecuadorian president considers “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the correct resolution of the dispute regarding the maritime borders that opposes Peru and Chile within the same court and said it is "beneficial for Latin America to take over international courts if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgment".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primaries in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory but we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I will then retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a resumption of the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the test result: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his eagerness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest HIV patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG) unit, in which he recovered in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was voiceless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade ilnu, in a press release.
Infectiologists and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system allocation presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, and that patients were up to 30 years of age for non-drug use.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years,” the scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual UNAIDS report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients have been nationally diagnosed with AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don’t think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don’t know they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for that, massively, to offer screening tests to all people who request it."
The specialists and members of Jalisco’s State AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a caregiver of AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I explode three times a week,” they say, not my case.
Change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who fear her today.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, that's fine, but as a result, even today, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, we find adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teens don't want to hear, the journalist assures.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to the counters, but that they be found in public toilets distributors and in places frequented by young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuousness.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had answered when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“That’s not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood, and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment upheld by a U.S. court of appeal ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro group consented via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighboring country and having solvency problems.
It therefore appears that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country on the star flag, at the expense of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the ruling delivered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s main glass manufacturer to take over the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany voting, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts had been secured by the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures.
In addition, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in every way the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vacuum" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool, did not obtain it.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country’s costs.
At the moment, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family company will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal of insurance will claim non-prosperity and require the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it would release it from the conventions signed by the two countries to the same level as the United States.
In addition, it notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two parts: they take on Vitro and they take on the country.
General balance sheet
Complaints by the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviéteurs has already encountered.
The court, headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied that it had provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from bank F/589 on behalf of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They sit on the Dragon Mars.
Gathered over the weekend in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall country, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under its English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in the history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was seen as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex for the long term
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex real estate developer launched into the stock market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
The birth of competition
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in computing, a new consortium with a competitive social purpose has just been born, the goal of which will be the clustering software services market in Central and South America.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball globe-trotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage convicts him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and head of the national basketball team, the BSN Bay, with both the BSN and the BSN.
“I’ve worn several hats in basketball all my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he cares about most are those that remind him of his passing as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This makes many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a big manager, took the lead of the team," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a ribbed player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That’s how it started with Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another championship.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's and Mincy's duties on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we reached 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and put a crack in the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the Panamanian Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In my youth, I love the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have seen at least the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, watch basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the "Dallas" production house, Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and he will miss me a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life to the full,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis at Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in cinema, he has received critical acclaim in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to entertain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Through this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot at her.
J.R. had put her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
One should write, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as "a huge man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel reported.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman’s death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who was known for his classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires impotoyables de J.R)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist troubled patients.
“I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be fine."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the “End of the World” has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the "great countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax gulf some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of late times would think it would be.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charme told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give lessons on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the “Media, Culture and End of the World” course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas have proliferated over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t go away,” said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” said Restall about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I’m fascinated to see what people are capable of doing to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us to believe in the end date of December 21st.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old last-year student at Temple, originally from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I admit that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he said.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew there were courses here on "the end of the world".
“The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophize about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a world at the end of the seven-year period.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several told us that they were thinking of going to “end of the world” parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at them together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
