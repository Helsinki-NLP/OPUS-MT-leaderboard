What does he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the sugarcane
The new mayors of the Czech capital will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representative office.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz members of the new council from the Czech SSR "tried" as they know the notoriously introduced slang, which emerged on the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political smith during the previous era by the mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new council did not understand the familiar terms too much.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a newbie in Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> responded to the test of the "Kmotrov" dictionary for culture.
And even though he was a political veteran, the mayor of B<0xC5><0x99>ezin reacted similarly.
Maybe the term "golf pit."
"It's the only expression of what you're presenting to me that I sometimes use."
"But I don't generally admit slang."
From the dictionary, which the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published in June before the ODS election congress, she chose six examples, mainly those that are notorieally linked to the Prague magistracy.
The socialists were to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the sugar factory", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "the siege".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The Fifth Councillor Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek directly refused the test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate how the civil democrats are doing."
"I'm now deciding how we're going to understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, City Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not in the title above allegedly recognize that it is an influential entrepreneur and friend of the voicing agent Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>kov.
"Voldemort" Kaucke says nothing to him and the only term he correctly guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the White Tunnel," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> says, and immediately adds, "But I know it better from the newspaper."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
The golf hole is then deciphered as the Blanka tunnel not only by the matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the environmental council Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>i Plachém is also known for where to find this figure - he guesses the meaning of the term "go to the sugar factory".
"I mean to go to some Prague company," Plachy is close to saying that it is the headquarters of the Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k companies.
According to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from the newspaper rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequency, there is no similar curved dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've had sex with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
“We call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and abbreviations of names are used,” says Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, president of the Czech SSR, whose supporters are nicknamed Hulda.
"I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Di<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tried the name and it works.
Radn<0xC3><0xAD> Weinert is a Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned of fraud before the elections when sponsoring the party, has the nickname "Player" with some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing that the social democrats admit in the internal party speech.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> says Hulda does not like to hear, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
"Doctor of Education Law" recalls that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> earned his title of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", issued a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso to be witches have a number of common traits.
They belong to an older generation, can’t get involved in work for health reasons, are free and don’t have children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This man's fate is very rare."
“Young healthy women don’t get discouraged because they help with work and give birth to children,” says a regular nurse who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house in Burkina Faso, the capital of West Africa.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measures".
She published an information booklet that should help the witch hunt limit.
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read," the newspaper Die Standard said in a statement.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which is adjacent to Burkina Faso, twenty-seven-year-old Amy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured oil and set her on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC server.
The plaintiffs claim that this was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, oil was created on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said it was after the group wanted to "throw out the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 24-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The rations of human souls have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to calm down the witch hunt, in the Gambia, the president himself took part last year.
"Gambian President Jammi, after the death of her aunt, launched a vast hunt for a witch who was supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the president himself with the help of black magic."
"He has called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's personal protection, have forcibly deported randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, people had to drink herbal lecterns with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two incarcerations on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released from prison.
Bachelor's tenant: Tops in stones, higher rent signed
An elderly underprivileged man stepped out of the door of the client center of the RPG company Apartments "uhlobarona" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a briefcase and in it a new lease for three apartments: his, his daughter, and his son, who is in charge of the punishment.
All three deregulations have just lifted the rent.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the apartment 2+1 second category 4100 kroner from next year.
"And there is no warm water there, and the petra must be melted (the chamber of solid fuel, see ed.), " shows the man with the finger in his son's new contract, the signature of which has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angryly and half resignedly.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and uneven," advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7, when the instructions on how to proceed against them will be published.
But the man has only one hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he mutters.
Ostrava has become a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market leases in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Therefore, we decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ovsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>ek<0xC3><0xA1>rna RPG is one of four in Ostrava and it is already full on Tuesday at nine o’clock in the morning.
Right next to the door is the security guard from the security agency and the triggering device at it.
"Rental 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One touch and a paper with a number will come out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already piping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're in line in half a second.
The older married couple comes to ask for the rent after a while, but the rent in the waiting room obviously does not apply to new rentals at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new leases are being sent to the post offices in Ostrava by the tenants of the majority of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since around mid-November.
In the letters, RPG Apartments suggests an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special barrier to new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's just in the loop," the employee replied after a moment of hesitation when the client presented himself as a journalist.
Deregulations and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was greeted by the vice-president of parliament and Ostrava-born Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from the Czech SSR, and even now he is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years from now, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even replace me with a plate in the toilet," said the man in the introduction.
Most of the time, according to the employees, retirees are coming to make sure they get a discount from the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount on February’s rent will also be received by other tenants, who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov's "regulatory" barrier, however, the questions are definitely not crowded.
“From yesterday’s 360 customers, there were only about forty to fifty people here because of the rent for 2011,” the workers estimate behind the counter.
RPGs, on the web and on their boards, suggest individual contract negotiation where it will be needed.
However, if both parties do not agree to the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“It’s not about the threat, but about the information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal process,” notes the RPG on its website.
"No one will be judged here," thinks one of the employees of the apartment RPG, and the man on the street in front of the client center is partly telling the truth.
“I have a pension of 13,000 and I have five thousand left to eat, I don’t have to judge,” he says.
However, the workers will soon be gone.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek is telling them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The lease regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartments, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing tenant still does not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Apartments, that the tenant, who is just annoyed by the negligence of the owner of the housing estate, is a sub-contractor.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs on rent could invest $4 billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be $5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room, meanwhile, repeats several red highlighted information.
“The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 apartments, that’s more than 90% of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square meter and a month," it appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will rise by 38 percent.
“In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter,” notes the RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
The RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not eliminate rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, especially to thermal savings - new windows and heating.
Preferentially, they are to be received by people who will sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include the nursery, the architects understood
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, buying toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by the children of employees of Arch.Design.
The project-architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings came from, has been calculating the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the building Avriopoint.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of the babyboom, and it was important for women designers and architects to be able to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of shortened schedules, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the framework of the social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to put together a demanding job with child care.
The minischool was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of management they managed to obtain the grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is funded from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After exhausting the financial aid (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for the grant was significantly helped by the company Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, the children are taken care of by a nurse and an M.S. teacher on a daily basis, so children can go to school without age restriction, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "miniski<0xC5><0x82>ka", there can be only 5 children at the same time, but during the day there is also more variety.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the program charge in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Not only do children play here, but they are also provided with high-quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop out of stressful situations with a delayed pick-up of children from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
In this way, parents make more productive use of their working hours.
It is not surprising that here a naturally loyal relationship of the employee - the employer is created.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the bone fascinates even after 100 years. Look in the interiors from Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the staircase resembles the back of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
Such is the house Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the local house has earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, chunks of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of gravel and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s secession.
The front of the house plays out dream lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When observing in detail, you can see the geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated in such a way that the impression of the brightness of colors is reinforced even more.
Bending and twisting of shapes with the same measure also appears in the interiors.
The wood in the waves copies the window frames, handrails, decorative elements of the door, a doll and a fox.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, which stands in Eixample district on the busy shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>'s house was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house’s designs started the successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> House Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and the G<0xC3><0xBC>ell Park, in which Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s other works are included.
From the locals the house of the back after completion served thanks to its organic shapes the nickname "House of the Bone".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it a "living house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a unique central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree inclination.
At the time of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s creation, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, however, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, at the completion of the building, the city council was overthrown and requested a correction.
For example, the council was concerned that the building was jammed with pillars even in the public corridor.
The correction never occurred, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the appeal of the city district, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied for (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to the jewellers.
The entire six-storey house crosses the staircase, which can rise up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the cancellation of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time not keeping the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received non-traditional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s game is also impressive with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is covered, and lamps.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and dignified apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
During the tours, they persisted, as they found that it was a very advantageous business and in addition, the tours expanded on the common and underfloor spaces, including the roof terraces.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist visas have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of the entrance to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly comrade with one of the inhabitants of the renter and visit him directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: women have different requirements than men
Not the noble frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. mattresses and grille, give the foundation a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, it decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior, into which mattresses and grills are taken.
A typical example?
Maybe on weekend cottages, where they don't regularly drown, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
However, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don’t have a lot of vents in the core, and they’re still lying on a solid board, they retain moisture: there might be mold underneath them.
When choosing, the habit also decides.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, where a lot of high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"They needed a mattress with a softening layer of linen foam on their loose shoulders, soles and sides."
“Such ones are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misunderstand the ‘information’ from joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczikkov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in stained furniture.
For many hockey players, as well as other customers, this is why years ago, the mattress with linen foam came out.
"Today it's all right, suitable mattress needs Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to appreciate a linseed foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, at night you will not turn around like after a hard game.
You'll just sleep better.
The foam line also acts as a protection against spills.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add another length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm thus need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, therefore 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example, singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"However, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on the back, you should have your hands comfortably covered in a bow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov, a master of the characteristics of the carpenters and decorators, who deals with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture of the ceiling.
At the double bed, each one needs its own grill and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to adjust the mattress heights.
Otherwise there will be nothing else but to mount the grills to different heights, but you do not have to succeed at every frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the forming and steaming layer.
“When touching your hand or sitting on the mattress, you definitely should not feel the spring,” warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
A full-length bed, where the mattresses and the floor are like a large Siamese twin, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover can not be washed, which is already common today.
And since we usually drink 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat at night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mating, it will start to resemble a large (and clogged) net.
That’s why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime warranty.
But he has everything.
And that’s why the advice from the seller: do not give up the mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work the removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although today, the mattress covers are commonly produced with scratches all over the circuit, so after unplugging we get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) could be reminiscent of rinsing in the rinsing
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead of a hard disk?
Never!
Maximum on the bed intended for one night visits.
However, cover the board with vents (if it does not already have them) and use a mattress with a spring basket and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in the sachets (from him.Taschenfederkern) and a steaming layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a foundation.
A latex or sandwich mattress (such as a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-stick slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you will always pay for slats with a larger number of slats, 28 and more, where slats are doubled in the area of the beder and their rigidity is possible.
The positioning lamellar grooves do not belong to the mattress with spring skeleton, because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to the setting of the stiffness of the lamella, the so-called shoulder joint can also be provided.
It is a special grip of the lamellae, which allows you to push or even tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "cracked".
For men who have "arms all over their backs", it is definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by manufacturers of mattresses, who in "men's" began to use the softening zone in the area of the shoulders.
Women also remember - they are given a softer surface in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or disc grilles with so-called multi-torque piercing are designed.
The pressure is divided into several points and the voltage is reduced.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and the wrong pillow (large and "inflated"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and tips to intervene only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
As a suitable size, it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder roll or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straws filled with grasses.
In fact, their producers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least mixtures.
The trend is simply in matrices.
The raw materials of oil, from which polyurethane foam is produced, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from hops and soya.
It is the soy that is used by all well-known producers.
“Bio in matting means that the core is made from a material of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also give yourself microcapsules to let go of the fresh smell of wood or lavender.
There is also division for men and women.
While men "cool" the plant extract from the ribs, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the contrary, the covers "thumbs".
Red pepper extract boosts blood circulation, making it a weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, it is so breathable than ordinary polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
A combination of various hardness cold foam and "line" foam create multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thigh and thigh should be.
For a quality mattress, you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are gated as health aids.
He was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage of Gumotex.
Saving on the mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use the actions of producers or sellers, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Maybe the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a built-in Memory foam in the ceiling for 11,990 crowns.
The second one can already be purchased for free.
The era of linear or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" tempo of Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, as astronauts were exposed to enormous overload during the launches.
The temperature in the heat softens, in the cold it hardens.
It adapts perfectly to the heat of the human body and optimally distributes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of stretch marks, but also to increase the comfort of sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the legs, which relieve the feet and the vascular system.
For example, foreign manufacturers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
People's monitoring devices want more and more parents, so they want to care for their children
The fear of owning a child is causing more and more people to think about watching through GPS.
The system originally created to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is so far about as big as a box of cheese, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were horrified by the disappearance of Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to ask for ways to better protect their children.
And at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood that a tragedy will happen,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case there may be abuse of such devices, even if they are put in a bag to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met with such a case yet."
“Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons,” added Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" is used for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns that if the child does not want to wear anything similar, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Great expectations were raised earlier by the parents of mobile phones, which, however, can be turned off just like this tracking device,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
“When it comes to a pre-arranged kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location.”
"Now it's a phone."
“When they start expanding tracking devices, they’ll be looking for them too, because their sale will certainly be backed by massive advertising.”
"In this case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, they allow such a device to help in the event of a sudden pedophile attack.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech from RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if there is an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to regularly send the location after a certain period of time has elapsed."
"In the event of damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices also have built-in naclonometers, so even if a person just slipped and stayed in motion, the device will immediately send a warning with the location," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, they can also carry out a similar service with smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to the case size trailers from sirens or smaller mobile phones.
That's always the danger of losing them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, devices that look like regular digital watches are now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that any attacker may not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll only know her for a while, and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether they develop into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology that is used to watch cars.
It is a combination of location detection through the GPS system (which is used by ordinary car navigation) and the function of the mobile phone that reports the current position of the car.
The army has a fire line that would encircle the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech Army purchased 445 kilometers of cords to fire the rigs.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The military has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cord is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the fuel lines from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES incinerators, wrote that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of incinerators per year during training.
However, from the figures of military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES called for, it follows that then, with very intensive pyrotechnic training, all generals, army commanders, secretaries or cleaners would have to go through every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondru and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of sixty kilometers of lighters.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the stock of the army would last for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it were to be paid for the basic training of each new professional, no more than two metres of incendiary cords, as experts say, the army has provided itself with fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of female or special units - of supplies on board.
However, the troops of the fast-track brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondro that they have almost no bullets in their handguns, so there are also limited shootings due to the emergency for the money.
There is no mention of the lack of underwear.
"It's not my head that they buy so many fires from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what they're up to."
“For us, the military is a good customer that we as traders try to comply with,” says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, STV Group’s business manager.
The Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justifies the hundreds of kilometers of cords purchased even by the fact that the army will have the supply of this "municado" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of STV Group only talks about the four-year life of the incinerator and the police or military pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish a name because of criticism from the army.
After the expiration of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantitative reduction to 445 kilometers of incandescent cords.
“We were 60 percent less than last year’s supply of two hundred and forty kilometers,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities to consume this munition even before the end of life.
It has been proven for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also more flexibly obtain more modern, and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already in serious trouble today with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the twenty thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to march to the Rhine.
This Czech, according to pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES called, is waiting for the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old bulbs, which today "lacino" buys.
Today I draw from the contacts I gained thanks to the competition
The winner of the competition <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostn<0xC3><0xAD>k of the year helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>i Pytlounov to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year’s competition <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostn<0xC3><0xAD>k of the year became the eighty-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From the savings of foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan he bought a semi-detached house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a third-year high school student at the time was a great deal of courage.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation at the time didn’t give me anything to try to do about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of these was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, he received another, equally high-quality one.
“We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Island of Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties about the franchise of hotels Pytloun are reporting,” says last year’s nutritionist number one.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel with a large share of the victory in the Life of the Year competition," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People knew me on the streets, they often congratulated me on the occasion, and I have to say it was nice,” he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended for anyone who is trying something.
You don’t even have to win, every vision is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to.
"With some I've met thanks to the competition, I've started trading regularly."
The fame associated with his success, according to him, had such a little impact on every employee.
He has about 70 of them.
"I admire their greater loyalty and pride in taking part in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of a good job for all of us together."
"Only my name is thrown into the foreground," says today modestly Lukas Pytloun.
Wishing my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory quickly settled the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the targeting of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the first place in last year’s Vodafone competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, took turns in the Slovenian House.
The jury then appreciated the effort, through which he built from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Skalica a company with tens of millions of turnover.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me, but all of my colleagues and increased our confidence in the competition,” the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karl <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>'s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for communist-occupied property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he was working at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a company on plastic baths.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eighteen years later, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the unprofessional public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, he was not in Farmet merely in the sign of the euphoria of victory.
The awards were based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of mechanical goods.
The crisis has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, did not prevent us either."
“The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was a release,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit less than before the crisis.
What they didn’t do at Farmet, however, is invest in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre from the grants, strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD>d<0xC3><0xA1>arsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It all shows that the crisis is behind them.
The market is growing again and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The “Absurdity of the Year” survey is the fourth part of the entrepreneurship survey.
Some of the inconsequential regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year’s Absurdity of the Year poll became the obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper excerpt from the trade register, although an official can get it with two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it will change.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer require an extract from the commercial register during checks with the insurance payers," said Jan Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ.
Introduce yourself to all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and those unreasonable to cancel them are the purpose of the contest of the absurdity of the year.
This year, it is already the fourth part of the business slaughter organised by the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Newspapers and the public is enjoying an ever-increasing popularity.
If about three thousand voters took part in the voting, there were almost four thousand already this year.
And it’s no wonder, the most diverse legal obligations that only serve to hold back business, are still enough for us.
"Perhaps in the number of tax receipts we are in the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Food Workers of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The contest "Absurdite of the Year" was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic misunderstandings every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The contest organiser then selects seven candidates for the "anti-census" and lets the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz during October.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more than 105 rules and regulations have been applied for this year’s survey.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also by professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of highways and motorways be paid customs, or that the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets be painted every two years.
This year’s list of seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Grocers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended this event.
“Economic prosperity can’t work where the state is kicking entrepreneurs in the foot, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to break the senseless regulation do not appear empty.
In 2007, people were most affected by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the business office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand on an exhibition or a tour.
This obligation has been removed by the new Commercial Code.
The second most-voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the employment office for its foreign employee a service trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two slender weights in the office.
This was mitigated in this year's announcement by the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator was scrapped.
The New Category Appreciates Socially Responsible Companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
This year, the fifth year of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> novin competition is a category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the receiver.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Firma in 2010 registered companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities varies diametrically from one to the other, the common denominator of their efforts can be considered support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns people with disabilities and elsewhere, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, among the fourteen full-republic finalists, the software company Et Netera in Prague, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which for seventeen years has been the main contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children.
The old paper from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, which has more than 70 percent of them, has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and the Vodafone Firma of the year was ranked third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, also won, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a moderately reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers to buy from Czech producers, supports civic activities in the nearby area and saves the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have as little impact on the environment as possible,” explains Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>, an employee of the company.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region thinks again about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local department store at its corporate events.
“In addition, we support the Man in distress Foundation, which helps the local Roma community in particular,” says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of super-standard bonuses to its employees.
“We are again making contributions to food, transport, improving qualifications and recreation,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category Responsible company of the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Firma competition of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition of Vodafone Firm of the Year."
“It’s not possible to sign up for this competition alone because it’s a subcategory of the Company’s main competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days, anti-corruption police arrested.
The iron detectives installed the local entrepreneur in the media sphere and the businessman with the realities Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle the restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was acquired by a specific interested party.
He was supposed to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G. half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for breach of public order and public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Plze<0xC5><0x88> State Department, with further details regarding the ongoing investigation.
Sixty-year-old businessman police officers were released after 24 hours.
The way in which the public competition could be influenced can only be speculated in view of the minimum amount of official information.
Speaking at the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Land Fund, Prava said that police officers were actually arrested in a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition is entitled "Call for the submission of a tender for the transfer of land rights under the law on land" and takes place in the event that the offered land will be of interest to more entitled applicants.
"These persons shall, as part of the challenge, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the proposed claims, the order of the purchasers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," a spokesperson for the fund explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who signed up to the challenge, and because he himself is also a qualified person, since he collected a number of restitution claims, offered to the interested parties the land that would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's been incarcerated for that.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money in custody.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had superstandard contacts at PF in Pilsen already in the past.
He was portrayed in the case of former PF chief V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing in the replacement restitution of the land on which the decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was at that time that Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the arrivals magistrate was to be built in the industrial zone of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole.
Later, he exchanged them very favorably with the magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to approach it, because otherwise, blocking the land would endanger the building.
Households will pay hundreds per month for housing
Households will have to pay for not only all types of energy from January, but also for water and sewage, heat supplies and elsewhere will grow rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw from their wallets up to hundreds of crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity costs up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and many will also be subject to central heat supplies.
Electricity generation in homes should go a hundred times a year longer than it is now.
The price of electricity has been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in the support of energy production from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
The gas costs slightly, but at a time when people warm up the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Each year, they also have to pay hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas flow throughout the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradci Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns per month, more than 1000 crowns per year will pay the family in Liberec.
The citizens of Prague, in turn, are at risk of more than 9% of the water and sewage supply to them, in the event that the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Prague will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the whole republic comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and manure should be affected by 7.4%.
For example, they can significantly increase the rental price in 450,000 rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, intends to increase rent by up to one hundred percent since January.
Those who will not agree with the new rent, are going to bring the company to court.
Regulated rents, which pay people in approximately 300,000 apartments, could increase by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, acts slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking most often ends in the care of doctors drunk, who were not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated from monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This is due to the experience of doctors who meet with similar cases on the incomes of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beer or wine is totally unfashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
"Trendem is definitely hard alcohol," said Prau, the primary of the children's department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"If they manage to pull a bottle of Daddy out of the closet, it's about whiskey, otherwise it's dominated by fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice, and there is not so much of it to feel," the mayor explained.
And it is also true that the speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> gives it.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases it was a plum that they brought from home," Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n's primary, 13 or 14-year-olds in hospital admissions are a fairly common phenomenon.
In front of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at a pediatrician in Motole, where sanitary facilities are tied up by underprivileged schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl in our house about four times."
“She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 milligrams of blood alcohol plus in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition hall in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at a dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the mayor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about dependence in the right sense.
"The term alcoholic is understood to mean several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case in children."
“In those who consume alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a distinct unspoken family-social background,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n said.
According to Jurin’s spokesman, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the Motole pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children’s drinks, which are taken away by their parents after an outpatient treatment, may be transported home by the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases where children just sit around the school and drink a bottle of cinnamon, according to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: a witch, a New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink it out of a bad conscience, or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“However, I experienced at the witch’s house the reception of seven children’s drinkers at once,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n said.
The drinker, who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors, is paradoxically advantageous compared to the one who suffers an unpleasant itching at home the next day.
The early headache caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose will trigger an induction infusion with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
“They’re actually better at it because they have a good night’s experience after that and nothing hurts.”
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n admitted, sometimes ruining patients' pleasant mood by at least calculating the costs of their treatment.
The transportation of the ambulance and hospitalization on the emergency bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I directly calculated to the children on a visit how much their alcohol cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to win for that one party," Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n added.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies do not have access to a regressive procedure in which the costs of treatment would be borne by the parents in the case of children's drinkers.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M, flew to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been abroad for rehearsals or show years.
This is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was still operated by the Czech Army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in Aeru Vodochody and the store’s intermediary – Omnipol – took over last week.
When the aircraft physically departs from Vodochod, according to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the press department of defense is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange were separated from the long-term stored aircraft, with no further deposits and investments from the ministry's resort."
"The two-seat L-159T1 has been changed in its current state and shape," said Prava Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seat aircraft, because in May 2009 the ministry signed with Aer Vodochody a contract worth 200 million crowns for the reconstruction of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ka, EADS has committed to deploying aircraft into the arms of an allied country.
"The contract makes it clear that the L-159 aircraft are being used by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore the customer's business, in what way this business will be realized," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The economic newspaper reported a while ago that, for example, the Spanish army has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign the selection procedure and contacted EADS directly.
At the time, the defence leadership argued that in return it would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will probably also have a court play.
The European Commission complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice that it had to select the aircraft based on a pan-European tender rather than a single manufacturer’s call.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbela within fourteen days.
Longer indicator than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men under 60 years of age,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as family health burden, Eales added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
She paid for them the same probabilities of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men in their 60s, it was a decrease of even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that supports the growth of prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows about this study from time to time, but he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks lies mostly snow-covered, the motorists in many places have been driving all night long.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several freight and passenger car accidents and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was announced by the Central Automobile Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) dispatcher.
Two trucks collided on the 91st kilometre, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometre, the accident claimed injuries.
There were also a number of personal cars in the trenches.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided over there.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then drive at 182 km at K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There are a few miles of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a few centimetres of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
The car columns are created, for example, on Proseka, and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also connected.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
For example, the tram runs late on the route between Karlovy Vary and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet again.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech circuits had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to the snow.
For example, there are problems with the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already congested, but only with increased caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk there are three impenetrable side roads, in Brno there are places made up of snow languages and in Blanensk there are necessary to overcome some communications in the above places of the snow chain.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko belonged to the most affected places.
So far there are closed routes: Ros<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Freezes will need to be put into their extraction.
When they are crossed, they cannot yet be estimated.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, caution is needed in the White Carpathian region.
On the roads that are there for the protection of nature are maintained only by an inert slope, because there is up to five centimeters of snow, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, it was attacked from two to ten centimeters of snow, the most rained in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region about 15 centimeters of snow was attacked.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually falling.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New ‘Smart Gun’
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, which is known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is something like a little super-precise deed.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm shells, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive strength, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Shora is usually not protected, and when a deadly rain of steel falls on him, he can get him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically deals with it by finding a target, sending it a laser beam, which determines the distance, so he gets an accurate point of intent, according to him he adjusts the intention and pushes the hook."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you push the trigger, the gun loads and fires the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
There will be 400 jobs.
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building at Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>st<0xC3><0xA4>st<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As on Wednesday, a giant in the field specializing in computers and their maintenance, moved in July next year 400 men and women their jobs from the current administrative building at Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Frankfurt.
According to a spokesman for Fujitsu, another 100 jobs in the group, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in a timely manner.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented out.
Bernd Wagner, the competent negotiator, said: “In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region sparked yesterday's joy in the winners and disappointment in the losers.
Frankfurt’s chief economic spokesman, Markus Frank (CDU), said it had succeeded in getting a “global player”.
It's a "fantastic expression of trust in this location."
Fujitsu is said to be good for the city, settling is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was said to have been informed on time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the real estate landlord in Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now the point is to prevent a long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, which is still used by Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Little Verticale" belonged ten years ago together with the other buildings on Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> to the most discussed construction intentions of the spa town.
Between the station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city entrance, which was criticized for the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, as well as a manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which at the time was still associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 together with Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year were sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers computers and servers, for example, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the most employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, while other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the starry soil, which is twenty years old, is also home to, among other things, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting close.
Amazon’s Internet service has shut down a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for discovery, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman urged other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is set to abstain according to one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon's server."
“A free speech in a free country,” the activists said in a news release on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Amazon Internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS)’s secret diplomatic filings to help them gain access to documents.
With the help of Twitter, Wikileaks explained to the move: "Fajn - our dollars are now being spent by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senate staff member Joe Lieberman said the search was carried out, according to CNN, based on information from Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate House Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," he said.
In the meantime, Lieberman has called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, recklessly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the entire planet," the U.S. Senate said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether U.S. or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in their efforts to expand stolen material.”
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London-based newspaper The Independent, 39-year-old Australian in the UK, Scotland Yard also knows the exact location.
An internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats as well.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to the statements from North America.
In the U.S., former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee has requested that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a senior government adviser, Stephen Harper, said on television — ironically, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could use a “target plane.”
Meanwhile, there was a gap between the White House and Assange's word gun.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “funny and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently released spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Envoy was appointed deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that are necessary after the publication of messages from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger because of Wikileaks publishing.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them, if that's necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream makers are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future freezers, which takes three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where is the ice cream going?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated Czech ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooling box with a spatula, puts it in the wrapper and sells it.
To find out, you do not need to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
Anyone who wants to learn more about ice cream, however, will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines set up a ice cream university to ensure that the ice cream from its machines is in line with the high Italian ideals everywhere.
About the basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there are also a few days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some want a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice rink in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's household came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the southern and native cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's another notable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the essential ingredients of milk, skimmed milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program at 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a spoon and drains pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the teacher is asked: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on their own?
Luciano warns to let himself be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural additives", apparently also used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as a guar nut from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will have the ice cube itself.
Certain variations of the basic material are permitted.
It will be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweetness department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from a white base that turns eggs into a yellow cream and cocoa to a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now participants are allowed to take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liqueur ice creams - either with or without eggs in the base material, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Licorice ice cream doesn’t have to taste more nutty when it contains more peanuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture raises the taste of Gelato properly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra serving of sugar is needed.
Luciano removes the device that determines the sugar content in the fruit (in this way, the winemakers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the machine to automatically produce the base material.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools to a minimum temperature.
Despite all the automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will sniff himself and also his colleagues out with a fruit pie when he gets out of control by a huge mixer.
“In every course,” thinks Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Auditors in Double Light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been voiced by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech Munich, said on Wednesday.
The leading group of Efsa experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts have been in contract for several years with the Ilsi lobbying association.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in Efsa's control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
Efsa's regulations are said to be in full compliance with Ilsa's documents and thus bear a copy of the industry, which should be controlled by an authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has warned of a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Ephesus passed without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed the parties.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the personal connection of the EU Office for Control with the Industrial Lobby, which has sparked interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those in the industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they have to prove it.
Kuiper is an associate professor at the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics – except for estimating the risks of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that there are currently genetically modified plants on leave in animals without any feeding attempts, and that there is no test of the response of genetic plants to environmental impacts.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not yield reliable results.
“If they don’t look for risks, how can they be found?” he asks.
I agree with Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as is the case in the US, and now in Europe as well.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to the corporations anymore.
Most of the time, studies that are critical to society are not published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Stone's Foot
Uli Gsell also took some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he was standing outside the station in Stuttgart, the tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September, the stags came and began to shoot a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in the trenches.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43.
You've secured some of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It says, "Cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one of them cut it, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
A stone's throw from Stuttgart leads to a forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen on the former depot of French Army ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were created during the crash in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they got caught up in a crack or disappeared in a landfill,” says a wooden butcher in his office, who used to be a watchman’s house.
He says that he was betrayed and threatened when, in September, in all the newspapers, he said he bought the remains of the northern wing from the company that carried out the demolition.
But he's been talking to the S-21s all day.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything about demolition.
And when that happens, it's the most sensible thing to do if the stones are still being used.
Then took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that he will return it during the rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the woods, the rest has been sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, builders of houses.
They came from all corners and pulled what went into the suitcase and into the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been transformed into "sedges" or as the edges of herb gardens.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political stuff."
He sits in his off-road car and goes for a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
He's tying up his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the republic.
It's a brake.
In the snow lies an artificially processed sandbox.
"One belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sander from Labe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on our way up through the woods.
It shows the crowd: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once it belonged to the squares at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidency in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what a struggle, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones had previously been manually broken down and transported by simple lattice and bull carriages, he becomes completely polite.
"It would be a scandal if something like that happened."
He's not rich, he's not rich at all.
Today, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, the top of the forest was set up by stoneworkers, one sculptor, one metalworker, one glassmaker and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the rest.
He has to go to Cologne in due course.
There, too, the stones will be saved.
Fight talent for high-potentials
There's a lot of people at lunch.
16 students are pressed at breads with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with VW’s developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and only by the way, to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to succeed in the race with the smartest heads, as well as VW, and invest in cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums, even before they get to the job market and others will be interested in them.
Because universities do not issue any lists of their students’ success, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes pens, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about internship programs, student employment and points them to the way to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates more closely and think about who would fit in as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not unusual.
The good news is that he is so openly fighting for his students.
“It was a rather substantial professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from long lists of applicants.
On the contrary, it must try and try to impose a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Above all, graduates of the engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the so-called VDI forecast, the shortage of engineers is still growing.
Roman Dykta is behind KPMG’s auditing and consulting firm.
It organizes demanding recruiting events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find a way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can check out KPMG’s branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will take part.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me from many interested people fly to the USA.
In the fight against High Potentials at universities, more and more tougher laws will apply according to Dikta.
"We want our Race to be different from the others."
"A simple trip on the sailboat was too little for us."
Looks like Dykt's talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants for a similar event last year."
“Some will soon finish their studies and plan to go to work with us,” he says.
In addition to direct on-campus consultation, mainly small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“As in Intersolar, for example,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of the staff department of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
The staff knows the problem with the young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are posted on the company’s website.
"Right now it's just complicated, occupying free space."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld collaborates with various colleges, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not conduct any expensive advertising activities.
Instead, the company tries to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Big corporations often can't offer it," says the head of the staff department of the Chamber.
When looking for a job, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare, or good treatment options are other deciding factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in one study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, the employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and the work environment and they monitor the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of the staff department of St<0xC3><0xBC>be hopes that her placement will bring points for job seekers.
“I think that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this is primarily an internal measure.
“The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the placement of an employee on the market within their own employees.
"Satisfying employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, they will make an advertisement of themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a rope game," Kriegler says.
Obama to Stop New Oil Gardens
Over the next few years, no new oil drilling will occur off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thereby revoked the final validity of the earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new gardens are still prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon in April.
In the face of this disaster, which cost 11 employees’ lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled to the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new gardens in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The commission of inquiry, which Obama has commissioned, is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban, which he paid for the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted an application for new gardening plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar catastrophes by stricter controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, a major reform is being undertaken by the supervisory authority, which has warned itself of many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas corporations.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil extracted in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the gas and oil industry," reads the result of the current research in the field by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what the regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are reduced to the point of appeal - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of oil escaped have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on theft, corruption, and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't worry," calms the environmental activist: "Today you will get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy who buries around his chest with water around his thighs: this scene works in water gloss with rainbow colors almost beautifully.
The fact that under the surface of a blue brown oil spill is not visible.
There used to be enough shrimp in the vessels, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the water that flowed slowly became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil was poured into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River delta, is one of the most heavily polluted areas in the world.
Along the river with mangrove swamps with many side streams, the entire range of launch is only visible.
The engine on the boat boils instead of light water with a brown gauze and whoever dips his hand into the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like black bars of medicinal herbs, rarely do palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are desperately looking for a flock of birds, which usually occur in wet areas: As soon as the engine on the boat is quiet, it will burst into the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrible silence.
“What is happening here is the ecological leadership of the war,” says Celestine Akpobari, sadly, “we live in constant fear of health.”
The comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battleground, where for several decades it has been fighting: more than 60 years ago the first conquerors from Europe recorded here, here in the 80s formed the first counter-offensive with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here he would not have to be a producer of the company Shell zavst
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the oil field in the Ogoni area is being used daily from the whole area of the three-dimensional delta of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining yards and 7000 kilometers of running more than two million barrels of black gold, the situation is not the case for the Group.
Every few hundred meters the steel structure stems from the water like a bizarre statue: "Christmas trees", so very gently they are called the heads of the garden openings.
They are 50 years old, most to the point of being intoxicated.
At any given moment, such a head of a garden hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of oil have flowed into the ecosystem in the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea in Alaska during the crash of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago - one of the biggest disasters in the history of the environment.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the ongoing ecological disaster.
While the Shell Group identifies sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent pollution, environmentalists are talking about cracking heads of gardens and impassable pipelines as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell is demanding much smaller security regulations than is customary in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: “Only the amount of disruptions in leadership is said to be “multiply higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained workshop under a wide sky, emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partly connected by leadership, partly arbitrarily scattered across the country, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a fire chamber for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
Forward flows from the pipeline into the catchment tank of gasoline, later the cap at the end of the pipeline of kerosene and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four 300-liter courts a day: “We make about 34,000 Naira” – about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of propellants in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still overtake illegal producers: because they have the raw material free of charge.
It comes from “bunkers” who connect to the leadership everywhere in Ogoni: experts say that at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw materials will be illegally disposed of: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking army officials, into tankers and sell them on the world market.
The debate over whether they caused the disaster to the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax way of production is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered as intruders, and if they did not destroy the life of fishermen so perfectly, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell in particular is so ruined that it only seems to take into account the company’s departure: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael's gonna be all right.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscle maker.
"The soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they are not in danger of imprisonment, but of painful retribution.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"The damned thing got our land in every respect to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous building error in A380 engines.
The A380 has a major security issue.
Investigators discovered during an inspection of a machine that landed in an emergency, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers were apparently more fortunate at an emergency landing in early November than was previously known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has detected a major safety issue on the engines of some A380 engines during its investigations - and now warns of a crash.
Perhaps the problem would have serious consequences: a single oil connection could lead to wear-and-wear cracks, according to a statement released by the ATSB on Thursday.
This fact could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are the engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is Qantas’s Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November in an emergency.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British manufacturer of turbines.
She filed a plea in law with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with large aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The lack of security was considered to be important enough to keep everyone concerned informed.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s in transit on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced an A380 engine as a safety measure.
A two-seater aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National Snowfall Causes Chaos in Transport <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos, train and aircraft connections are disrupted on many roads.
At least three people died in a car accident.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow – leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is very limited transport.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it did not handle the new snow.
There was still a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a storm surge on the Baltic Sea coast in <0xC5><0xA0>lesvik-Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xA1> in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
The snow curtains in Saxony have caused considerable problems on highways and state roads.
According to bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore the highest level of yellow fever in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
From the part there was attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the curtains.
In the evening, there were several trucks and passenger cars left.
Police in Saxony-Anhalt have also reported major problems on the roads.
The wind and snow on the A2 caused slow operation and congestion.
In Durynsk there were problems due to the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German track, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Duryn and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, twisted trees on the tracks or broken top management and swings.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In the city of Saalfeld he had to stop one ICE in Munich.
165 passengers were on the train from firefighters and lifeguards, carrying wool blankets, food and drink.
The wind was blowing across the road.
In large German airports, many flights were cancelled due to the snowy winds.
According to the spokesman, flight information centres have already been reported from Munich cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, the Fraport spokesman said it had been cancelled for 40 years.
The maintenance of roads is in constant operation.
Although only a few passengers remained at the airport without a connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to the snowy road: a freight car was also caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver is dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car into a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light dust, and therefore will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the force of a thunderstorm.
But it will be a great winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could amount to up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank was just revitalizing its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were able to return to their old jobs.
But now, apparently, the financial group wants the cost of the renovation again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland reports, with a reference to the spokesman.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still looking into whether it's more sensible to own or sell a property and then rent it again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany again, after a short period of time, gives up its corporate headquarters.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them cost-effectively.
According to the data, the energy conversion amounted to about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the press release, experts estimate the value of the towers renamed to "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund’s property or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people venerated the memory of the collapsed miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions down there.
Still, the dead have not been released, because the security situation in the chessboard is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were trapped in the bottom.
In the shaft where the accident occurred, a probe was launched, but it did not reveal any trace of life.
Due to the high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not come down for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that miners no longer had any chance of survival.
He still failed to free the dead.
Now they have honored the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps and names of the miners were built to commemorate the monument of the buried miners.
There are also pictures and personal belongings, such as clothes and surfboards found here.
In the state government buildings, flags were flown on half-jerdes.
New Zealand hoped the miners would once again come out of the “deep ground” on the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was trapped down.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also captured.
Rescuers began by setting fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poison gas dissolves, it starts to cool down high temperatures inside the bottom, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warriors!
Is horror suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to re-conquer the old frontier with his fighting epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and in a big kill almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody action, because our hero is in the throes of the cross
On the other hand, the One Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters will either utter at most one or two sentences, or let themselves fall into passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and plays in Scotland’s horridly beautiful hilly landscape, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult film enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It’s good when the movie has multiple target groups, it’s just a shame when they stand out from each other.
After filming his wild and stylized trilogy of drug dealers "Pusher", Winding Refn is considered to be the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but staggers to get his works closer to either the mainstream humor or the mainstream humor.
Most of the fans of the art cinema will probably let themselves be repelled everywhere by the squirting brain and interiors.
The fans of the action films flee at the latest at the moment when the One-Eye emerges for free-explaining reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries sailing to Jerusalem and will remain silent for the rest of eternity in the wind and fog, before America seems to add to it.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into the cinema and now it was only released on DVD.
It’s a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the special facade, places up to the blood-stained, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it’s not about dialogue or precise action, it’s all about the atmosphere, the fiery dream that became a movie.
And that's not a runaway thing for the audience.
Refn does not spare him even a moment of relaxation and slowly smothers him with his freezing shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the indescribable hatred that radiates from the heart of the character.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eyed, will keep something as an innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and a transitional ally of the warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It causes damage, but maybe only for those who are damaged.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has issued a new alert to Syria’s secret nuclear program.
The country, however, is preventing expression – and will not even allow controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007.
It stands on the shores of Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reveal her name when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
According to a U.S. foreign intelligence report from the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonia – from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technique of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor might have been before the destruction, it is intended to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were also photographs that showed the building near or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, we do not know much more than then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was very certain that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a "presumable reactor", although the CIA's presentation is considered "valuable".
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how confident the reactor is that it has ahead of it, a senior UN diplomat said last summer, the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
The so-called "unused military buildings" were quickly wiped out by the Syrians and also properly leveled the ground.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 the IAEA team was able to find traces of uranium, which was produced by humans, under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial dealers from a Member State just after the attack, which should be more far-reaching than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer – perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot, therefore, confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But that was denied by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, the auditors were prohibited from carrying out a second inspection in el-Kibar and from accessing the rubble of the bombed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said at the time.
The investigation of this case thus goes unhesitatingly since June 2008 and "increases into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers the key to making progress on the matter another three devices that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
At the same time, the auditors have not yet revealed which device they are dealing with, what function they have, or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally designates Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, driven again by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite imagery complexes of buildings that are probably one of the suspicious objects.
It seems to be located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three locations.
In Vienna, it sounded that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been sent to the United States in advance to investigate the military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite imagery that material was transported here and there between these three places and the square at Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where that uranium comes from, and where it should later decompose plutonium on the bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important clues are stored in these three locations.
As hundreds of truckloads have disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have any information on where the dog got to.
Just a few kilometres from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria checked in 1998 as a suitable repository for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in contact with the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, it carried out Syria at all suspicious land-use sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn’t help to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only this effort shows how much interest the auditors are.
In the meantime, Damascus rejected this proposal.
If the Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why it is not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest checks on the vessels.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who is supposed to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "the possibility that I will be turning to in the future", but he has yet to weigh in.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA’s Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, “What happens if they don’t find anything?”
Love in the Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a still unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
We don’t know much about it yet – but it also causes discomfort.
There is persistent talk of this woman falling in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film was shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote via the UN refugee agency Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Bosnian newspapers now report - Jolie is also the UN ambassador for refugee assistance.
It is not exactly diplomatic – she offered to women already weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where she was raped, the love stories were not finished and Jolie’s attitude towards the victim reveals enough about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended to the UN to help the refugees, so that Jolie be released as an ambassador, according to the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed for smaller Hannibals in Sarajevo to shoot - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that in her film she does not follow any political intentions, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains unclear.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: lovers have known each other before the war and meet again when she is dressed like a Bosnian Muslim in a Serbian camp, where she serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie’s film really starts before the war – is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being developed on her, which "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
Now they can free her from the hucksters of Hollywood: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but away
It's good for Iry again tonight.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans are delighted by the sound of loud music, ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer bowls - and they hit each other.
Beer pong is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to fly to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and a restrained informatics, it doesn't like much together.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, reacting to the hectic question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, going to an interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Due to the poor outlook at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
Guys leaving: Like Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in due course, according to experts from the ESRI Institute of Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
By 2015, there were 200,000 migrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, the discontent is now once again widening.
The economic crisis is mainly caused by young, educated Irish people, who have so far experienced only ascension.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years of boom.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men in their 30s are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes from the hill."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, it goes away and our country loses a generation.”
"Please let the last one go."
Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish student union, sees the future black because the government says it is just lying and offers young people no prospects for the future.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy for creating new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her colleagues move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of work abroad.
“For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the ladder of a career,” says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for half a year.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan rarely gets home in the meantime, because he works in extra shifts so he can pay off a home loan.
“The situation is sometimes really a little crazy,” he says, when for the first time in a long time he crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm basically not at all."
He laughs at himself and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in the entrances parking large expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by the loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” he says.
He's afraid it doesn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, poured a hot tea, and said, "I don't have children to live with, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the cries that he hears so often now.
“No one has to starve – our situation is not even as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again, and life in Ireland went on, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let yourself have an open future and simply wait for how life will develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand too?
But there is one more thing that worries him enough these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might go to a divorce party.
“Almost no emotion,” he says, and drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds alarming."
"Let's call it the party of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support of private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated areas, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
About 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again it is the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support arose during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and were looking forward to a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luize In<0xC3><0xA1>cia Luly da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent criminal activity worsened.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of criminal activity last year, but that’s down from 38% from last year’s figure and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private businesses and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private businesses are necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the field, as noted by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, versus last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, versus 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on November 28.
But they were far worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections were filled with ballots and recurring votes, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling stations, and intimidation.
The polling room is open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, were roaming around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a handful of presumed candidates, shouted that it was a fraud and called for an election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have said cautiously that they “do not believe that these discrepancies, no matter how serious, did not necessarily cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are binding on René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce its preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, the rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is appointed to the Electoral Commission for reaching a decisive battle.
Due to the epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people still living in the states after the earthquake, there were concerns that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
About 250,000 IDs, which are necessary for the vote, remained undisclosed shortly before the election.
There's a lot to bet on.
The donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will base themselves on this.
After peaks in the center
In the weeks when she suddenly won, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the Argentine president, gains from public sympathy, where her popularity has increased from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term in the elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will give up the incomprehension of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy even after his wife became president, had a habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernandez's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and were further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after the chaotic sessions (which involved faking and accusing the government of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more room to spend according to his will.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow by up to 9%.
The official rate of inflation now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the number approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina was suffocating the economic collapse, set a priority on growing and reducing poverty, rather than on controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that had joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now put this policy to death?
She called for negotiations between private companies and professional broadcasters.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez announces that he wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government signed an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
President Fernandez is now facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which he owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be under the supervision of the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the minister of economy, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that will resemble an introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer holiday they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to quietly give up the many opinions her husband had in politics.
Half-encouraging for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of whom were eligible, voted on Nov. 27 by the city’s mayor and council in five urban districts, which may be seen as a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeo.
Mr. Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that dominate the fort and have a strong stake in business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only closely.
Although his side Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor’s offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of greater independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The elections were held like most Taiwanese elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flagged women squabbles.
There was even a secret attempt at an assassination.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, wounded him and killed the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspects fall on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the fortress itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates argued about plans for state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP has also abandoned the instigation of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact that China’s trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue in commercial payments, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in general.
It will be better to wait for it after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was the speaker and advocate of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for President, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing all it can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "confidential alternative" to Mr Ma's stupefied approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be outraged by this move.
In a statement released from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT spokesman says it is reorganizing its cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for the establishment of friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Nominated for the Grammy Award: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
At the request of the President and the people, they must take note legally.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is named one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with nominations in the category of Best New Artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with the Grammy rules, where the artist must not release more than three albums before "the identity is established in the
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and a steady hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that starred in the critically acclaimed 2003 Norah Jones.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly award the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride to the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will be competing against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a snarky New Orleans favorite and a frequent guest on the HBO series "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk has earned several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large ensembles, where the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble stood in competition and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" may have chosen as the basis of beauty.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the category of classical music
Nominees for classical music have a wide selection of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
Leading the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with a five-point lead and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a three-point lead.
Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and the Synergy Vocal
Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariah and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and The Enchan Wa by The Enchanted Wa

P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 on the L.A. Philharmonic under the Esa-Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental solo performance with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin interpreter Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle East tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, leading the Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's work.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition classics, she received the nomination of soprano Jessye Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a halt to trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of this as an American citizen."
"It means that justice will always win."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against, only loudly shout out."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The negotiations began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
"America no longer exists," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Center has also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had been congregating in Riverside County for years without incident, but wished for a larger and more convenient space than the storage space he had rented along with the manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new mosque measuring 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take place 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps even beyond.
The researchers discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand out from the main elements that have been considered and fundamental to date.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not evidence that it’s a form of really ‘extraterrestrial’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You're going to be surprised what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside of Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this paper, published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Britt<0xC3><0xA1>ry and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open Kells, University.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element for another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one after the other.
“Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.”
"The result is that organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
“However, arsenic is so different that it doesn’t work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes,” Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better at the action of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with the replacement of arsenic, there is an increased possibility that the life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example of how this reality could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used in earlier forms of life.
“This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period,” said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The rest of the dog was found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a giant pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs then Wednesday late at night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about their whereabouts.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not infected so that they could express themselves on the case.
They were very happy when they found their two akits in a hut in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Trace's actions, a three-year-old Trace dog and a 10-month-old Didi fan, were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi tribes Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate in the regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop away from almost a month’s journey for a couple after dog shows.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - the boxer's dog, the Parson Russell terrier and the Brittany heather - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs in the car had enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced the theft of the car at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to stray dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether prices would be granted.
The lion is once again ready to roar now that MGM’s restructuring gets final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so it could start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a “packaged” creditors’ plan to settle around $5 billion in debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s earnings that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. competition order, MGM does not remain any legal impediments to relaunch Spyglass Entertainment founder Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main studio leaders.
The number of employees drops to about 320 out of the original more than 400.
MGM does not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees to the planned financial resources enabling a $500 million loan to finance the new MGM operations and production.
Now it’s a connection with an investment bank that alone needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve their finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million in interest payments annually.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and a sales expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial woes and 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus finance that the creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from the competition in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which charge for their services that run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which this year has only released one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the financing of two films, the premise of which will be the book "Hobit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to settle a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your budget on the balance of gifts
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
For the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 ball swings or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget in balance for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toy can I buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law was working; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys have emerged with associated websites, two of the most well-known toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as a toy with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, for 3 years) are plush animals that sing when you press their belly.
When one presses, the animal releases a tone and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.

The best choice in combination of song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year at Elmo Live technology I borrowed a 14-inch animatronic doll that can play the game Simon Says and also can walk a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with locking wheels.
The children test Mickey's toy as a dance instructor, although their parents complain about a lack of volume control.

The introduction of a finer police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders in accord with military authority.
He wanted the female members – China’s state-sponsored urban planners, feared and reprehensible for their harsh actions and a preference for violence – to convey a certain impression on the noises of the surrounding.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what beautiful girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood in the spotlight.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as per the ruler.
The four covers of the head perfectly sit on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white stripes.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang oversightedly.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new pupils to have a college education.
The province of Guangdong changed its gray-green uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China has replaced stubborn looks with a strong weapon: in 2009 it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the cart with snacks incessantly and stared straight at the owner until the house salesman took half an hour off and took off.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as its main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough sides of the police, also a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city’s proclamation, to impose fines and other administrative measures.
But Chinese media usually captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province sentenced an uninvolved viewer to death after using his mobile phone to shoot as they began a procedure to protest the plot.
Last year there was training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. Among other things, in the manual was a description of how to effectively beat the culprit without a blood mark.
This year, a melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
A video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese police officers how they attack a street vendor.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another discussion of tactics.
There was a "really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the period announced an interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News’s lead author dealt with the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good character and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is psychologically too demanding for women over the age of 25.
“Their image is an important thing,” said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
"Candidates must first prove external qualities, which then determine the next, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then it comes to a number of nature and "inner quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district city management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that the demands on height are common in China for other jobs as well, both genders.
As well as the requirement for comparative features of the face.
Which means that the issue of good looks is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Medically impaired or frozen will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a chrome or a back man to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps an eye on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her collaborator with the valleys, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, a group of more than ten traders are standing up to run on foot or on wheels and trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bags as possible before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the merchant began to run away, and left his bicycle with a trolley full of noodles in time.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than effortless.
“Every day is basically the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts in order to be able to entertain the sellers of the goods.
They can only threaten to report a given fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after fake news spread that police had killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only rarely.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were watching that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle that had been repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store as required by law.
The owner of the car could cry as he wished.
15 minutes away in front of the policeman, facing anger, with anti-vehicle arches and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in image maintenance and smoothing.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said factually.
"For the most part, it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with the former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which followed almost a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action in the Senate's ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that he is not planning to bring any further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, after her death.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton hired them to lobby for them, so much to mention documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had recently been an assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in opposition to the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was published "it turned out that it was a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are being investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry is careful about the political complaints, after a large number of accidents, the decision-making was made, including the decision-making
Federal prosecutors “clearly concealed their weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the matter.
“It basically shows that the laws don’t apply to high-ranking government officials,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s attorney general, said in an interview that he was called Monday by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then the next day, and told him that the Ministry had not seen any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is cooperating with the plaintiffs in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in Wednesday's statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had submitted to the State Representatives.
"It's not nice for me to copy the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint, in which the ethics group charges that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents to the $ 96,000 federal election bill.
The Electoral Commission said it had not enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major non-profit company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email showed that after Mr. Hampton started working as a lobbyist in the company, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had “broken” into the Ministry of the Interior regarding the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after I hired Mr. Hampton for a lobbying job.
When the report of the affair first came out last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to run for the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the criminal offence, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes that the ethics committee will quickly follow up with the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevadan people," she said.
Cheshire’s appeal is on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the ranks of the courtroom.
A minute later, they sent messages of terrible testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says more than 140,000 tweets were about raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was sentenced to death, and was scheduled to be officially terminated with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court is likely to employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process – including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters – created a “circular atmosphere” and this extensive, immediate penetration of information with incisive details then introduced the jury in the decision to make a decision.
This claim could force the judge to deal with the question of whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom are also required.
“As I have experienced with this translation, I think there is a real danger that incorporating new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Advocate for Mr. Hayese.
Jon C. Blue, a judge at the state’s Supreme Court, briefly rejected the statement regarding last week’s earnings and that the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted in subversive ways.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the court has recognized that notoriety of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the Cleveland Chiropractic conviction, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when, in his decision, he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, he was "indicated on the grounds of a media scandal".
Some are convinced that this criminal act was the inspiration for the TV show and film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes’s judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be needed to determine how to communicate from the courthouses, which was not the case in Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in highly investigated cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out voluntarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtrooms can make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes’ many lawyers who would be able to argue for years to stop the execution of the verdict.
Prosecutors also say that in the case of Mr. Hayese, there may be a preconceived case when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential judges by showing them a criminal photograph of a threatening character when selecting a jury.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by the photos of the victim, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Prosecutors say they will also reject the constitution of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a judge who was critical of state representatives and that by his decision incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to reconsider on the weekend.
The reporters were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in a statement against the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly smothering the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily stream of media, cameras and reporters in front of the court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter’s impact is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting of the reports was more intimidating than the later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the scope of further proceedings.
But some lawyers have called for appeals from the courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling on Dr. Sheppard’s ruling on the broad scope of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can kindness overcome a failure?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of courtesy emerged this week in Washington.
Is this the first wave of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
President Obama’s Tuesday meeting with parliamentary leaders has not brought any substantive findings on key topics that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party confusion.
The president’s deficit committee’s Wednesday public meeting was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close co-operation for several months has built up mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that members are still dividing.
And it's pretty hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period – they probe each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday hearing and its subsequent evaluation of the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too broad and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the relations that have prevailed here over the last two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections upset the party's emotions, and then they calmed down.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cut at the end of the year has expired, and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, it is only because Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction in taxes on property, while the unemployed refuse to support unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new start-up agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
“After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism – which is to a large extent widespread – that politeness will lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of the tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders are now faced with the danger of exacerbation, know that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal a new health care law.
These outlines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes, the increase in retirement age and the reduction in expenditure.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure on the deficit issues to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the court, who propose that, in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, small foundations or wills for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans call on Obama to address budget, tax and healthcare, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What will cause the shift?
Public opinion.
There’s a lot of evidence that despite the party’s recent election bias, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If it could go to the bottom, as it did in 1995, then both sides will closely monitor the public’s reactions.
Anyone who threatens to reduce the vote will likely change the course and look for a compromise.
It can be an optimistic view of things.
The bias and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a greater ideological gap has been created between Obama and the Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground in issues that still divide them.
A U.S. document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's governance is in the hands of a "kleptocratic" and it continues part of the fees and protection fees that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical office” – will take its toll as the money begins to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, for many years repeatedly denied the allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for wrongful charges for such a claim.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was questioned on a proven witness of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
It is unusual, however, to encounter such details expressed in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The Moscow city government and its links with criminal gangs have led some to call it ‘disfunctioning,’ and confirm that the government acts more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the report said.
“Criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (the term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means ‘surface’ or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the office of the State Representative, as well as inside Moscow.
"Analysts have identified and three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second stage."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill vacancies in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow are aware that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer so in the course of."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself can already have difficulties; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who don’t pay fast enough, their stores are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report talks about the men’s suitcases, probably rigged with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgia Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem, in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of the political class because there are no longer any political classes in Russia.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia’s corruption costs more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked from the least corrupt to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening hours certainly did not arouse enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Moscow’s shortcomings can be blamed for Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin’s ability to argue on the issue of saying.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks published could have been fake and reacted angrily to a statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth about the whole issue is that it’s about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In the controversy, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves The Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "cutter" for his rawness during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, he remains the commander of this remote state of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former vassals still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, a long-standing loyalty is also entrenched in Anlong Vengu.
In April, the victims at the Forum of Truth and Reconciliation were allowed to confront in public the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian court jointly set up the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentencing of a former leader, notoriously known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the 35th Duke.
With each such advance, there has been increased unrest among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage with Cambodian society.
“Among the former Khmer Rouge is fear and terror, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, the life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were killed or starved to death for disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated climbers in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began transitioning to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chean and Khieu in the year.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former fighters of the Khmer Rouge have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
“These people had only minimal benefit from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, who runs a public forum across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of the realisation of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"That Mok enjoyed them all."
"But now life is hard because we have to make sure everything is on our own."
The ongoing court of the Khmer Rouge also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leading perpetrators and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
There was very little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to his wooden cottage on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and the shadows appeared across the scorched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are any further criminal charges, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the documentation center said.
"Silence in Khmer relations means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, it has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four parties on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, also young people in Anlong Vengu knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will sue."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks, and courts are beginning to influence, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the mountains of the Dangrek Mountains, the road is paved with gravel and smothered with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle made of black ash, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was burned at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and was planning to visit Pol Pot’s resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus Agrees to Appear to Have Stockpiles of Uranium-Based Weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergey Martynov.
Over the years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it appears they hit the rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, a couple of covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for a Wednesday deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama’s 47th National Summit on Nuclear Security in April, at which Belarus was designated.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.”
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world for up to four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone either."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was light-emitting, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and liquidation facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on supplying the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bienawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used to make weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to remove its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual suffocation.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that more consistent adherence to democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for the improvement of mutual relations and this is necessary for the progress of the country and its neighbours," he said.
The Spanish government has not made CIA gems with the years
The Spanish government has not made any concessions regarding the CIA’s flights of captured Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo via Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is according to documents provided by the Wikileaks server El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is also written that the then First Representative of the Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vegov<0xC3><0xA1> requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may thus show that he has proper oversight over the area".
In June 2006, following the Council of Europe communication, in which dozens of countries, including Spain, were accused of co-infringing human rights, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The representative of the prime minister said that the Council of Europe's message "deleted Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegov<0xC3><0xA1> stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
“They simply want to be informed” so that they are not “incarcerated unprepared,” Aguirre said in one of the documents.
Also, then Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos told the U.S. Ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter as low as possible, but by having it in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited options."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that if it concerns him, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the secrecy of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or any sensitive information," the embassy said after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns rather because of "the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than because of the secrecy of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the luncheon of the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they will consider to be a good excuse", he ordered
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the negotiations of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Lidov<0xC3><0xA1> strata - czech) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the People's Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. action that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and that may even be a violation of human rights.
Admitted mother-murderer complained online about mother's "age"
A young woman spoke about the child when he was already dead, and had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
To be able to understand them, it is necessary to know a woman’s emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They went together for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their co-existence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week.
However, from the content of her communication, it is evident that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, Menorca herself wrote, "Alberto is kind of upset that I left for work."
"When I told him it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with the kid all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send your baby.”
He complains, “If he doesn’t like me to leave my little one with my mother, I’ll take him when I get back,” he says.
In May he spoke of his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to hold on until the 19th, because I have to go to work for the 20th, so I don't miss the place."
He explains that if all goes well, take your son with you.
"He's going to be with who he's going to be with, me, and never again in my life will it happen that I'm going to leave him with someone other than my mother", a dubious intention due to her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When he pulls out this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and likely was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other.
“He’s on one side with me and he likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day.”
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'm gonna save some money for the babysitter."
Seventeenth Greeting and Complaint.
"The big mouth of Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what videos he sent you on the e-mail, see how he likes it, he'll meet me, sex is needed."
The thirty-second report: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a message about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Monica's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manse.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she let herself be called "Muki ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (Motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Yesterday, M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial pulpit in Palmyra, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "she was not supposed to hurt the little one in any way".
Before that, however, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor request a psychiatric examination.
The people would get 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of 28 November, the PP could have the main word on the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - prof.) already has a given idea of the general elections, whether there will be an increase in votes or not, its electoral results are more positive
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this trend of increase is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and by the loyalists of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could win 12 MPs in the House.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party) parties.
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC party (the left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia) would have lost one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (the Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one more mandate, or they would have been
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona's 6th administrative district (District of Barcelona is dell'), ahead of the Barcelona's 6th administration.
Both the nationalists and the people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose the town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a majority and would not even be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the debacle of Republicans, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative office – since at least 5% of the votes must be obtained.
The PP party has increased the number of votes won in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnout in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP won only by 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy – during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also gained on other important towns such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell has provided Al-Qaida with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, another three were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by the agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda, among which were the "Ty<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC4><0x87>", also known as "Ty<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC4><0x87>"
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure by means of "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaida at the international level and " thereby limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, it could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then faked and then delivered to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida to continue their "fight-free" quests.
This broken cell was not the only active cell that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were involved in these investigations, in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the next few days Bartenders would not be present in other European countries, as they were in minefields.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another development was developed in Thailand, under which they were killed by Mujahededdin Att.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, stole travel passports, in particular, from tourists who met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, must have been valid for several years and be without a visa.
The investigation documents underscore that, to date, no facts are known that would link those detained from Catalonia to the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should have been one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and Spain.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the attack, about a thousand dollars were sent from the Catalan transfer agency, which were “insulated” to buy cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the “command” that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) calls for Mass to stop the fiscal deal
The President of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camachov<0xC3><0xA1> had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arturo Masa her own conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are in line with the priorities and priorities proposed by the President of the Generalitat.
The President of the Catalan People's Party has arrived at a meeting with Arthur Mass with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in the elections of last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining favor, so the candidate of the CiU needs to be able to attend at least one of the constituencies.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the Senate would like to keep until the general elections are held, but so far the talks that are being held in these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for the President of the PP, in order to gain its support for its entry into office, "he will have to end all the sovereign and libertarian manifestations", as well as the economic agreement - similar to that of Baskick - that the leader of the CiU even wanted to let vote on in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to tear down the entrenched political apparatus of self-government and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the appointment of Mass will be dealt with by the PP parties Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today he meets with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivero (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporto (Solidaritat Catalana).
The head of the geriatric facility assures that there was no death as a result of "lack of action"
The Olot Center’s performance does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The head of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric center gave a press conference yesterday to explain the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vilya Dilmé, a caretaker who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors, who had been killed in the attack.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, accompanied by a lawyer at the facility, Joana Canada, announced that "the desire of La Caritat's home would be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the murder, but "the legality and responsibility of the prosecution will be borne by us.
In addition to the damage to a good name that these institutions may suffer because they did not reveal the criminal activities of the caretaker in time, a major threat to La Caritat's home is now the material compensation requirements that are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the deceased.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was committed in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients from home for seniors with the suspicion that in many cases he did not examine the deceased any doctor in person, but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything was settled by phone.
La Caritat, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "lack of action could not in any case be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s legal representative added that “there is no indication in the case that, apart from the defendant himself, any third party would be allowed to doubt.”
A man now dubbed the "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 deaths yesterday and clarified that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later killed the second old man.
in this case, death caused by giving too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when using a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control the access of personnel to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six cases out of the nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, it is only the analysis that is now going on in the laboratory that should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for his first victims to die less cruelly or, on the contrary, he killed them by giving a lie, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in a medical claim, nor do they rule out that the number of dead may be higher than what he confessed to, and justify their behavior in the various versions given by Vila to the court with the knowledge that he must change his actions when it turns out that he killed him.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to the judiciary, so that the whole scope of the matter is clarified.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The marginal differentials closed by force and the shares of the European bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank’s ability to make a mistake – the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, despite the decline, is recovering – but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take an investor some time before he loses his anxiety.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for an end to the plan to buy back state debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to maintain unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity rate forecasts "at least until March" and will comply with a three-month unlimited access bid by the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue to buy bonds in their program and that they will even announce its intensification.
If it does not meet the created expectations, it will re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if they continue blindly to the extent of liquidity, God is with us!
The same was the case at a rally in May, where they claimed they didn’t even think about buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets – tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, it was announced by the stock market on Monday, and on Wednesday it announced that it had already purchased many of them, prompting further market collapse.
Yesterday's bid for a one-year exchange in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood in the market, which occurred after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures were published, representing the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10 billion on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable as part of the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the approval of a new budget by parliament and still lack enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to release the tension in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, which calls for a political compromise that would show that we are united and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to pleasure.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, measures to revive employment – to the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Year Period since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, twice as many as other European stock markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank has been quick and convincing - we are apparently benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year debt tender, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a great demand for it, which will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don’t need – in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March – further high rates and market access would be closed to us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Cesar's strategy of women - "to not only be like this, but also seem like this."
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen group will attack Vega Sicilia’s negotiations requested by his children
Storms in the open conflict in the family of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, will not be silenced.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, will attack after he branded him as “totally insignificant”, El Enebro’s legal action planned for the 16th of this month and demanded five of his seven descendants, on which the company should try to force their majority to help him out.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are handing over the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company does not seem willing to settle his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed as assignees during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year, were registered on its board of directors and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was called by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has once again restored the thunder in the lion of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
An appeal against a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the commission’s appeal until the dispute is resolved.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's Mezquiriz is considered by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial authority and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the proceedings of 18 January".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "completely irrelevant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to call the court in June’s hearing.
El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a right of use of 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when translating the question of a judicial attack into a hearing. The date of this translation has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes to improve in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull's entry into the 2004 Formula 1 series, his history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the chances of this new coming team too seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into the hands of a sledgehammer such as the Red Bull.
In fact, this is a powerful motion-simulating software that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or to simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the head of Siemens’ industry division, explains that the use of this software device enabled the Red Bull team to perform “in a matter of hours, in near real time” modifications and enhancements that are otherwise detected during the downturn.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements over one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine that Renault is fully responsible for.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capability is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology race about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visitors - especially to journalists.
Everything that is happening here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants of this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is without a doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
Behind the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation in the racing circuits, however, there are other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and no one knows it.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, said five years ago that it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and that the rest was due to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by a computer because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
In two years, HP will establish 20 of its own stores in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday officially opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Spanish Vice President Helena Herrer has set an example of a newly renovated store on Barcelona’s Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has adopted a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s personal systems, has ensured that the business opening philosophy will remain the same – using local distributors who have industry experience and knowledge.
Here, the North American company advises with exclusive design equipment sales (with products that can be tested interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of retail staff.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be franchising, stressing that the exclusive network of stores is aimed at “improving customer service, services to small and medium-sized businesses when buying, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging.”
The store in Barcelona is part of a world-class pioneering pilot program aimed at solving any problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So we will be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which can take up to two days otherwise.”
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service,” Helena Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on “stealing” one million customers in three years from its competitors
More optimistic than other CEOs, Banco Sabadell Board Delegate Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is expected to reduce interest rates, which will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects him to gain a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public assistance at FROB, to gain market share by signing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if the ones who leave the bank - because up to the present day and the institution, the drugstores were rather small and small.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% when it comes to private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or one can also say austerity, in order to reduce the costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it will present the results for the period.
Many banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world’s banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension to the next period.
Clients who leave the savings account will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
Indeed, it is believed that the road from the crisis in Spain will be "longer".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that passive war – which reduces margins – is slowing down, the price of mortgages for the risk that banks and savers pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, thereby compensating for the reduction of margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.”
“We haven’t closed the hatch yet, but the differentials are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already issued his networks on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as from November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not free to say that in Spain "they will demand a larger size".
"There will be no stone left on the rock next year," he said.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "decently reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter between the red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can supplant fund-raising on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term financing by means of repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes further wave of merger saver
The CEO of CECA yesterday denied that another wave of mergers should arise, and again insisted on the speed at which the reorganization of the sector is carried out.
When he started the process of uniting Spanish savers, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase would not take part and were waiting for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederacy, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most mergers have already been made, Cajasolu's incorporation into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most of it is completely done; it is possible that we will go to 13 or 14, instead of 17 institutions, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," he said.
In his statements at the meeting of ADEA (Association of the leading and executive officials of Aragon) Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it turns out in the <0xC5><0xA0>ko<0xC5><0x82>y
“To move from 45 shareholders with an average assets volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62%, so that they are larger and therefore fall in line with the Treaty of Basel,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unlucky views on the slow pace of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is a reminder that we must be on time before the end of the year".
José Antonio Olavarrieta, CEO of CECA, said yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and “probably” in the world, and those who doubt it have “lack of knowledge”.
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savers as well as the system, which has managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking industry came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets led to a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without a fee, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and airports).
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgadov<0xC3><0xA1>, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the critics at the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It has already been said that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be like, which points to the idea of adhering to the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to March – although now it may seem like a sci-fi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is the reworking of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary tightness, penalties for guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and the extension of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no space for the races now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission initiated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of its sleeves of constitutional reform to prevent them since 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the fiscal austerity and stability plans of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
Second, this Central European country was shown when Merkel painfully challenged the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear view when she called for the reform of the European Union's conventions to allow the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, for private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This view was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat tempered, has been approved, and in the coming months we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow these measures since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures with which he seems to disagree too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone in which countries breaking the rules will be heavily sanctioned and may be forced to report deferrals, and the private sector will also have to bear some costs.
Germany suggests to us that we must take a firm path to growth by increasing the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which the governments in the years of Spain’s growth boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could happen to be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will bring more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that they give us in the spring of 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after a meeting with big companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel's address, the path to the thinker is open to the thinker that
However, the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it does not seem that she wants to move with it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of overly serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The finty, as presented by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax, show the cleverness of not intending to escape punishment.
The alleged disqualification of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergia Ramose) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused an inkling of whether or not this was a non-sporting behaviour and whether UEFA would be able to shoot both.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the named players one by one deliberately wasted time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre – with Real Madrid finishing in their group in the lead – and will be able, deprived of cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, the disciplinary commission awarded the UEFA coach José Mourinho a penalty for two games and the guilty players received a fine.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten but are being followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was the team of Real Madrid (who in his anthem boastes of nobility and honor, and who has already repented for similar acts of his player), and also seems to be due to the dramatization of his next epic, led by Mourinho, who joins in this way.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of negotiation, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts violate the law; indeed, it is an action that respects the rules of sport, whose mind
It is decided what kind of damage such an act affects the sports spirit.
One of the attributes of sports behavior is the physical inviolability of the players, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. did not result in violent play.
Another of these attributes that characterize a clean game is to avoid allowing players to have an advantage over the opponent’s team thanks to their offense – which also did not happen here.
So the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a ladder or violation of the law did not occur in a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as visible as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and were happy to receive the punishment.
The next question, however, is what advantage the perpetrators will have from their intentional offence.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match he does not achieve any benefit, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this action, players will be penalized, and they will pass to the second round of cards, in which to exclude the first one in a penalty.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether it is an advantage.
In short, and well, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of making a strategic decision that will allow you to get the maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players were not supposed to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather they chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between the duplicity and the circumvention of the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a duplicity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions were transferred to trigger them from the leadership.
Damage to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
The fight of offers on the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar focuses on the avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a fast-growing celebration played by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December comes again the pre-Christmas party, which still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, have resulted in the struggle to get customers by lowering prices: almost all of them have gone down from the euro.
To complete the number complication, this year’s calendar (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated applications for the week from December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations for the days at the top (16th and 17th), while the previous week did not expire.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that cancelled collective parties for budget reasons.
In order not to abandon the traditions, many employees pay their expenses at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of tolerance, says the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restaurac<0xC3><0xAD>o de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities does not at this time dare to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think about it before they make a reservation."
“They want to get out, but when it comes to pricing, they’re cautious,” he adds.
Shops will go well with those who "provide quality and good service at a favorable price", he says and recalls that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down the stairs and most customers now want to spend about 25 euros.
A survey in various facilities shows that the biggest increase in booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group announces a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most demands being on spending up to 30 euros, which was adapted to the menu offered, the total prices of which are from 25 to 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year’s calendar to more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, which should be chosen by everyone, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after having seen an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have a relatively solid outlook on Christmas markets.
The company’s sources emphasize that December 18th will also be a busy day, as there will be a pre-Christmas celebration among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more, as they recorded a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - more than).
They also noted that companies are already emerging, which again call their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings "survived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
He did not give up this impression even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused a great deal of unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published on the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary turmoil that is fueling the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and important details they offer about the content of the communication and the ideas of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, as far as nuclear security is concerned, does not arise from the "state of the Union", rather than from the "state of the Union".
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after works to ease their destruction in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for Washington’s vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of the then national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban control, the alleged diversion of nuclear and nuclear weapons."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with the program of guided missiles is no longer observed only in the United States, but also in Russia, as a spreading and constitutive reason to be on the watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or U.S.-led missile programs," the U.S. foreign ministry said in a statement.
The biggest new documentation released by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
Depe<0xC5><0xA1>e, published by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected."
Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, said in a statement: “Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also called on Washington to "explain very well" during a visit by Chief of Army General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani army must end with silent support for terrorist groups."
Hon to Chief WikiLeaks
Obama has appointed a high-ranking official responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new information leaks.
Interpol issues a “red challenge” to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary challenge", the so-called "order of news", to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks legal representative Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on 20 November, when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
According to Interpol, 188 countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “in order to impose a temporary link on him and issue him.”
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by the red challenge, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to be the enabling arrest - this must be ensured from the national police component - in particular, the arrests are made in the case of the arrests, the arrests, the arrests, etc.
Assenge’s move has been aggravated by lawyers who published a letter yesterday declaring that the nine-year-old founder of WikiLeaks has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities through videoconference.
They also recall that Asseng requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of their case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Berijo, Stalin’s head of security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal chase," the letter said.
As the whole world searches for him – and his mother defends her son’s innocence from Australia – Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine – in this interview, he demanded the resignation of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations and thus violate international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who called the demand for demis “funny and absurd.”
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual running the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorism official, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding Assange to the spotlight contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of the congress, who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations, "to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would financially contribute to them".
Tom Flanagan, the adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying that Assange should be "killed", which he then had to appeal.
"Obama should write him a reward or use a drone or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in government, who is responsible for leaking information, has been betrayed, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace of mind in ERC by "defeating" the suburb of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its persistence.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s apparently found a recipe to fight the already several internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia), unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to supporters of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as its leader himself, and that the old man cannot do it for him.
That’s why the leader of the Left will try to gain new criticism by smearing it, which will help him turn to the general election.
First, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak secretly about his stay in office.
With the help of ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the supporters of Caroda want to pass the criminal vote on to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of defensive measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting up and subjugating his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself to be confirmed with half a vote and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at the rallies.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce the demi- tion, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in return for promising to move Congress in the fall of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that “multipleness” is damaging to stability, and that its goal is for the organization to once and for all be able to wash its dirty clothes behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a remarkable article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’s ideologist, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed “in exchange for several goals.”
And he appointed five of them, two of whom stand out.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces from the sector favoured by Caroda.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should end the meeting completely as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by voting.
The conclusion of the meeting system model, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has been fighting in this direction already at the last two rallies.
However, the 2008 Knesset Assembly decided that the meeting must be judged at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party reflected in the resolution of the issue.
Now, without emerging critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 killed in 2010
According to the journal MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decline of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the previous month of the year, there were a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of corpses in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, further a wound from grace to the head and had her hands and feet tied with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n colony, in Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, participants discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the area of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight gunshots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, a body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, and a 25-caliber gun shell was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescuers did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
The residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported finding the body with their hands tied behind their backs and their head wrapped in a Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza district was reported, and reports of death were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony of Los Reyes La Paz.
in a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
The 17th was found two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found a dead man wrapped in a yellow-blue vest, who was previously reported to be a killer,
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no life-marks was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement.
On the skin of the woman was discovered a tattoo of the holy figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - trans.) and also necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had a head covered with a belt were found in the town of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victim, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, in which it read: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found bearing marks after torture and had bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony's Centre of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl districts.
The first was found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a belt and had a message left behind; the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Together with him, they found agents and a note with a message.
China is committed to its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country had developed an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, and said it would take 40 to 45 percent of its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent in 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference, said.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had developed an immense effort to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million over the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this issue with the international community.
He reported that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including last year’s approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Further, he said, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as he said, a program for the efficient use of energy, which has been introduced over the past five years, and which has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, the project on the exchange of bulbs for energy-saving bulbs and the project on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert climate change adviser, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Legal Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former president of this party is entitled to apply to the National Organizing Committee for his rights.
The National President of the PAN party, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legitimate, and that the former president of that party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his rights.
In an interview, which was taken before the objection was raised by the Governor of the State, Gabin Cué Monteagud, said that the exclusion of Espina is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
“Mr Espino has the right to appeal, in his case, by means of a complaint to the National Council’s Committee on the Rules of Procedure in order to deal with a decision made by the competent authority,” he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she has never been at the negotiating table about the alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez has expressed his conviction that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held next December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (the 2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was intended for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue is behind him, and therefore "we do not tolerate internal competition, on the contrary we profit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said the committee could elect without debate the best president or president the PAN deserves for the next three years, so it would hand over the staff to "who the committee decides".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, and I'm proud to hand over the office of the president of the party to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise that the party has seen in the last elections in July will be reflected in future clans, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will be the flag and will be the object of observation throughout the country, because "there are many expectations and demands placed on them" and I am sure that Gabino will expect you to do so.
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) for his speeches within four years, César Nava called on the members of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) to think about the consequences of the election.
“If they think that the governments of Zedilla and Salinase were better than the governments of Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n, let them start defending them, let them come out of their fold,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the speech in the National Auditorium, as there is no use of bribery or censorship in this country.
Obama on Twitter promotes law to support undocumented students
“If you think that the Dream Act approval is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass the law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents by making a contribution to his personal Twitter account.
“If you think that the Dream Act approval is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass the law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a larger document that calls on the public to immediately connect with senators, as the vote on this law is approaching.
“Because it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion sound,” he says.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless it was approved to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and fund the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new nuclear-weapons treaty with Russia, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a "concluding vote" on the Dream Act, so that a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is true.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the U.S. Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, have lived in the country for the past five years and have been admitted to a higher education institution or an army.
However, supporters need to approve the bill by 60 votes, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of his supporters carry out intense agitation to ensure the passage of this law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators with whom the incumbents negotiate the most are the senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mela Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but told them he would no longer support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet made a statement.
Although the House of Representatives is sticking to a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature insert the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put the finger into the wound" is a period of the Czech "to bite the nail on the head - c.
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... Finger in the wound? What is waiting for me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuelov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and her nickname is the same.
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrow", said the Argentinian writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the round table of Mayra and Marisol, Moder.
Luisa Valenzuelov<0xC3><0xA1> read a text dedicated to Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Celori, and which Schultz later described as a great story in which Luisa first appeared as a protagonist, who in her quest for knowledge of what the "wound" is, walks from the doctor to the doctor, from whom she does not eat.
He goes on to say, “Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound.”
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: "the wound represents it really exposed and thus symbolically it is a scar."
The protagonist took a slight breath and concluded that "in the morning she managed to learn only so much that she was really exposed to it and that it did not exist", but she gained the conviction that the pleasures and fears in the language had to go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also performed with a delightful story, which he called Praise the Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at one point it appears.
with the elements of magical realism he tells of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back the people who went far, or corrected the honor lost by one virgin, this story, who then turned away to speak of America, the great novelist did not write them off, in which
“Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the fictitious testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but otherwise he never managed to tell the story of America with such a sculpturality that he even missed studying.”
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and precisely where reality and lies merge, where one no longer knows what from the story belongs to one group and what to the other, the fictitious literature reaches its peak.
This is known as the "Cervant tradition".
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monterov<0xC3><0xA1> emphasized and commended the variety of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her speech Finger to the Wound.
A Cuban-Portuguese writer pointed her finger at a major social violence wound that goes through her country – and is shared by Latin America – and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
“I think that good literature, good poetry, and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which of course is not intended,” she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader.
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero concluded, whose performance was also emphasized "on this finger to the wound of the writer committed by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits, and in the control of consciousness, which overwhelms dogmatism, he forgets that “there is little no hiding behind every touch, and there is little yes behind every denial.”
"In order to be masters of our thoughts and realities, we must color: and coloring means repeatedly putting a finger in the wound and disturbing those who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, black-and-white, that they color, that they color, and that they prefer to color, that they color, without coloring,
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
in the duel Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles featuring their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has gone with the undefeated, and that is why this opportunity is so special for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed a step behind the winner, and played curiously with the same team in the next final.
As a coach, he reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he had the burden of the Morelia club, with which he fell 4-2 against Toluca in total; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again went on to a decisive duel and also lost it 3–0 to Ra<0xC5><0xBE>y<0xC3><0xBD> <0xC5><0xA0>ko<0xC5><0xBE>
Already with the Santos Laguna club in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluca, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzen<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - to the last 2 minutes)
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most institutionalist for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important one," he said, referring to the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in living memory has a previous finale, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we took the lesson that until the referee does not write the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because he has played with two penalty points, we have already agreed, we have agreed to the two penalties, we have already agreed
but it doesn't bother him that this series could be decided by the penalty shoot-out, it believes in the penalty shoot-out, and it's in the penalty shoot-out: "You're never trying to get to the penalty shoot-out, you're trying to end up in normal time, but sometimes there's no other option, and we're just trying to be in the penalty shoot-out.
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and taste the glory that titles bring for the first time.
The United States changes the rules for granting visas
People will have to contact the Visa Application Centres before the interview at the Consular Office; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
From January 10, 2011, the visa negotiation process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Visa Application Service Centre (ASC) even before the interview at the Consular Office.
The ASC staff will retrieve the applicant’s biometric information and they will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages, including the following:
The total cost of obtaining a visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay the fee for the appointment, the second for the processing of the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will only pay a single fee that covers all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of visa applications (including a temporary worker visa) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and will be taken fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for a service of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for alien life.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 hours of experts in astrobiology, science, dealing with the study of the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington.
When asked by reporters, NASA said it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for alien life", sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that, apart from us, there are other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could imagine the possibility of becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in them improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been considered too toxic to any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, another form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the real scope of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even begun yet, when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tica, Czech "The Party of the Democratic Revolution" - czech), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "The Party of Labour" - czech.
Before the start of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanares Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo “behaved” against the constitutional reform, as it is excluded.
This reform, they repeated, begins “baptism” because now it will be two people from the same number of parties that will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Britim from the PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech "National Action Party" - c.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute a political marginality from the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He said that over the next few days, they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjugated by these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When [the opposition coalitions] come here, I look at it because we are cut out of any decision, they don’t even want to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and will therefore form a pluralistic group.
It is not possible to allow Congress to be "common" after what was monopolistic.
The aspiration to reform the law is not to have endless bipartisanism in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, added Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that at the moment Congress has become a "benefit" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"Before it was controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected, so that he could be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five of us, who are probably going to be nine, but right now they are seeing us in five, we have not left behind because of the golden agreements, each of us in a different faction, we have come together to find a place at the negotiating table, and we have come up with a problem, because the reform is
An additional 200 thousand pesos is issued for "supplier"
The Town Hall in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n will pay another check discussed by the owner of the company supplying electrical equipment.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos was sent to the town hall by Lorena Guadalupe Camachova Palazuelos.
In this way, the amount paid in this second half of the year by the owner of the company supplying the electrical equipment amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Town Hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued at a rate of 200,144.56 pesos and as its subject matter was stated "equilibrium of unreserved payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which has been monitored by the State Audit Office because of the sale at high prices, additional fees.
What has not been said is the total turnover that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will be sent in favor of the Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, only what we owe her, as well as the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that the service provider did not renew it to the service provider.
in the preceding period, after 25 July, the newspaper Noroeste published a revision of the cheques issued by the Town Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that during the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of the mayor of Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-C<0xC3><0xA1>nchez,
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be maintained.
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada estate in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of foreign tourists into the depths of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada basin, the tourism sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraz Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zona Dorada region, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad things that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who walk around and see the disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea of the trades they avoid, otherwise they wouldn’t have solved these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to be dedicated to preventive maintenance, not just to fix existing problems," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as residents we deserve a clean living space, the town hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city."
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, a statue of deer).
"Today, in order to welcome tourists, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city flooded with cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where continuous maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need to pay attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
Speaking about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the mayor, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, the undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will be necessary to put these places in order first, so that we can make them attractive and put them on the list we have to promote this destination.”
IP Demands Results After Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of the CCE, would like to see Members take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
The parliamentary period of full dignified work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is plunged into convulsions and faces major problems.
The 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, includes a total of 40 national councils.
The waiting list for new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on great responsibility and set an example on the path to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their rights, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become the carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlaps that would move the ruling forward in line with the order.
“We want them to do decent work and to be primarily committed to society and sectors because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in past elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the strength in order to achieve the country’s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support the creation of jobs.”
As far as travel is concerned, he asked that new lawmakers give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate given that it is an important economic activity, a currency-carrying and an investment that is also directly opposed to agriculture."
In addition to issuing funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and help with an alcohol law that has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for three kings.
Dolls, strollers and bicycles are on the wish list for children in the Coronad Valenzuel family, along with other toys.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the upcoming holiday of the Three Kings to fulfill their ideas, as their household counts exactly 12 people and one dragon.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions because the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband isn’t lucky, but we’re selling mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I’m going out on the street with the ‘babies’ to sell,” said Cayetana Valenzuelova Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetano would have wanted clothes the size of a year.
“He said to me, ‘I’d like this monster car,’ but I told him, ‘We’ll see my son,’ because it was very expensive.”
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal clothes and shoes.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is 12, ten-year-old Isaiah is 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis, so he would like a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronad Valenzuela family, you can take part in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and bring a gift or money in cash at the reception of the journal Noroeste.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Who Were Arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Istria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
“Around 750 Indian hemp sheds, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to manufacture were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were suspected by the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to go to the courthouse in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian hemp, keeping it for the purpose of trading with it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were subsequently carried out after a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
“It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests,” Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Service of the City of Estrie of Quebec State Police, Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships being loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overrun, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"To a considerable extent, I rely on the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that has built the bile under your feet," said Liberals chief Michael Ignatieff, a surrounded MP after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, a law that would allow the detention of any person from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her side not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The non-Democrats agree to take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the bearer of another bill, C-35," Ms. Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it puts the blame on refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition.
"Canadians are massing to inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to the men's side and treat it like some kind of pathologist."
“They expect Canada to take consistent action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every member opposed would be held accountable for his or her position in front of his or her constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, is trying not to forget this idea: Quebec, with the Department of Investigation from New York, is planning to consult on this issue as early as January next year.
The Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised not one of us.
It should be noted that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil himself.
More than that, public safety critics, PQ side Stéphane Bergeron, rated the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "amateur solutions embedded in the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in a public hearing.
“In addition, Mr. Charest is determined not to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something,” he explains.
“The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and politics at the Institute for the Education of Senior State Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners that allow them to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Government of Charest.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to amend the Penal Code so that it could be better adapted for this type of criminal activity.
This request would be based on an officer for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), informed by the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow Justices, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments to the document.
During Operation Jaro 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Penal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
The rivers are under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have been under strict control due to heavy rainfall, which has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a drought of soil.
Two houses were pre-evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road has been abandoned.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions of heavy rainfall hit, i.e., from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
It could fall a total of up to 100 millimeters.
If we count these collisions with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a warning against the flood risk for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers to the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in les Laurentides, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, became the subject of river emergency and continuous control.
In the area of Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re, severe rainfall caused the dispersal of some lakes, in Sainte-Julien, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was built as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be pre-evacuated.
In Outaouais, the discharge of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency services have an emergency and are monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a warning on Wednesday against strong floods for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as gossip about noise.
The Radio and Television Council ruled that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM group had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative outcry from the Haitians", not snarling loud noises.
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Board has received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcast, which were broadcasted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made on the basis of a complaint by the Quebec Joint Front of Social Assistance Recipients.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
“The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of the ‘Dupont noon news’ hit the sensitive topic in an impartial and appropriate manner.”
There was no charge against him.
The latest dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then went into the media shootout, which caused many reactions.
The moderator of CHOI said that he did not send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that they will get the money they need.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates a disproportionate negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already made up my three-day delay on that thing."
"My record has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use crude expression in broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated "over the scope of their duties".
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences shall be minimal.
King of kung fu in Montreal.
The inhabitants of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, have an extremely special time.
An athlete who excels in “sand” (kung-fu “full contact”), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters tatami and rings all over the world looking for new challenges.
“I started with martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.”
“In my case, I’m looking for matches everywhere, because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that appears at martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a guard and an assistant for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing category full contact and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for China at the World Cup in San Shou."
"They were invited competitors who finished in the top four at the last World Cup in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won bronze."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be at this pace for the first time this year or so!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where strokes of the fist and foot, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches take place traditionally on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, originating from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
As long as Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in kung-fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a friendly guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category compete to be crowned as the only champion, King Kung Fu."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> $450 million without public competition
Hydro-Québec has agreed to a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche is the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which obtained the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project in the total amount of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, named <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec’s selection to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" obtained a lucrative contract without any announcement of public competition.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies in front of us poses a serious ethical problem that risks exclusion from competition and triggers price increases.
“It’s a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition.”
"This means that people, no longer party agreements, are doing them openly today," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard posed this question to the National Assembly, because he says it is hard to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, this afternoon, strongly denied that this was a collusion contract.
"I have my own way," she murmured, claiming that the PQ was "unfair" and "lacking accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that the PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice around the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that will allow two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call to bid on a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the scope of work.
The building is already under construction and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the possibility of competition being negotiated; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly at the speed of the business register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
Eastmain’s main boss, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that forces us to shake our head over the fact that the project management agreement was concluded after a mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few contestants offering an offer, your bid prices may be higher."
“You have two choices: that you pick people who figure in that contract as contestants, and that you say, ‘Let’s make a deal that’s satisfactory and at a good price.’
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, of which Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Energy management".
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that the PQ is also linked to companies that “finance” it, before clarifying that it is rather about its management staff.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not encourage confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "impartial" brands and environmental certification, to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in a media universe that urges us and encourages more socially responsible consumption, this media universe is calling for a lack of reliable information, a failure to meet its obligations, a failure to even qualify as a brake for its own sake, a failure to keep it from being a burden.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still do not trust them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don’t believe in the promises of environmental companies, simply because green advertising by companies, finds a measuring tool that was developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certificates placed on so-called fair products, but also about the reliability of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, says Barometer.
In the same way, the policy debate on this topic is accepted as serious by just 14.6% of Quebec’s population.
However, responsible consumption information appears to be the top priority for stimulating this page of consumption, which currently accounts for almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of the information would dilute the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake to be identified by Barometer, at a higher price for these products.
By the way, a third of Quebecers are untrustworthy about the stated data on the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus reacting to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with traders from their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is pleased to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives for as little impact on the environment as possible by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological consciousness apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Barometer says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in a crowd of interest.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive survey of behaviors who used this cliché.
State loan to buy back the kin complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees at the same time, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le", which sought a $7 million gift from the Minister of Culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not achieve what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would otherwise be lower, some were original expectations, which could lay the foundation for viable solutions under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and 12.8 million requests have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have already been revised for a reduction.
The proposal and action plan was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who runs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec was built against the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, suggesting that the Minister of Culture should not fund a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinema halls.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas within ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the change by the state's financial council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crippling in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, led by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, believing it will cost $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, the only of three film companies, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to promote the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir, and so he is ignored, he and his group think about the suggestions for reductions that are made to him.
Raised tires in Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources announced through WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be a complex minority of Canadians against the Americans, but by the same blow they express their sense of superiority over the last-named against Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canada-U.S. relations when he goes to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, exposed to a public outcry yesterday, also provide sensitive details to get each other “under the skin.”
The Communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
To the great admiration of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian minority complex, almost perfect, may be presuming political leaders to talk about internal betting, rather than realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
“The United States, therefore,” he concluded, “is a proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening, to talk about them.”
The Ambassador understands this "listening silence" less about the fact that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or an even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa's chargé d'affaires, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure that the government remains in the vote of confidence at the beginning of February, regarding the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits to its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," he said.
Nowhere is there a mention that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties conditional their survival on the quality of the proposed reconstruction plan.
Another January 2008 report, and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington’s attention to a further negative image that casts dramatic series broadcast on CBC on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned by the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too fancy references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report mentions that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it is written here, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a secretary of state."
"The Secret has accepted the fact that he's reviewing the file."
Finally, let’s note that the people involved with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
This was reported and was heard by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to restore home lighting, trade lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n in order to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) limit, which corresponds to almost a third of the next limit to be reached in 2020 for climate stabilisation.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of difficult to implement commitments to reduce on the part of industrially developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the flared bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, replace the bulbs with fluorescent or, even better, the bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential quantities of the bulbs will be emitted from 1 billion tons.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the world’s car park emissions.
In Kodani last year, a large country with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, took part in voluntary reduction plans that would allow global GHG emissions to drop from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance another 5 Gt to achieve by 2020 climate stabilisation at 2 degrees Celsius so that it can be ruled out that it will not get out of control.
In heated bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissolved in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%,is a product of light.
With fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluorocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, which were introduced this week to Philips - this company is said to have participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives us the idea of a 100-year-old bulb with a possible wear and tear.
All of these new bulbs can also work with refractory and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers set up a collection.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a flu-compact bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant, which discharges many of the mercury needed to produce the electricity consumed in ignited bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants produce 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would receive from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast is looking forward to the results of the elections.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to immediately announce preliminary results," a U.N. spokesman said.
"It calls on all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission has allowed the earliest date - Wednesday midnight - to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's curfew.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on television confirmed that the commission "continues to work" to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, challenges have multiplied around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alass Ouattar.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the repeal of the Constitutional Council for "underwater" voting in the north, which has been administered by the former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters practiced by the United Nations (New Army) in the north of the country have deterred supporters of President Ivory Coast from going to the polls.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the election commission from sending the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was seen as coronating the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political group that it could be held responsible for any possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassana Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of the year in France.
The rate of unemployment in France in terms of words according to the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with correction of seasonal deviations from the (CVS) thresholds.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In a broader picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of the current young people in the labour market was further marked by a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the International Labour Office (ILO).
As for seniors, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is 482,000 people aged 50 and older and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, however, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after a 9.9% rate in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and jailed
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne Administrative Council, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into the public procurement case.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of abusing the company's property, abusing public funds and public property, concealing, providing fees, accepting fees for the purpose of influencing the office and holding the gun, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that he intends to ask him, and not any delusions."
“It’s easy to prosecute him for many criminal reasons, but it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent a short message to the judges before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Luciana Simona, his client never did anything but ensure the functioning of the warehouses he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to awarding contracts or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew about such a thing, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was accused Wednesday of abusing public funds and conspiracy, and left on the loose, under judicial supervision, to contact the protagonists of the whole affair.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation of all the facts that are presented to him."
"The investigating judge will look into it and leave it free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more people have been charged and released on Tuesday night, with being under judicial supervision for two of them, state prosecutor Michel Raffin said in a statement.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is charged with accepting fees for the purpose of influencing the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the abduction and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "the conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "hiding the misuse of the company's assets".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged with a concurrent case of fraudulent public contracts relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to steal money from a large-scale gangster.
The investigation is carried out in several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the context of the closure of public procurement, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the La Ciotat landfill, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysian Palace oversteps Syria mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the work of Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spying", unified opinions in France, brought diplomacy to combat readiness and stressed the importance of the relationship.
All this has been carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
The U.S. documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young Frenchman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the U.S. program for the fraudulent trade in ivory.
Finally, they expose to sharp light the way the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram, written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has the title: "Iran: French Comments on the Way of Solution in Case of Imprisonment".
The adviser to the Elysee Palace for Strategic Affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomacy of Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend that Americans do just as much for him to be transported back to his own country by the violence detained in Iran.
"Do the noise", they say, "keep saying "in the media the words "basic rights of man", "innocent", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring to the table the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it the more they will ask you to stop doing it.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "silently nothing will solve", the Iranians are "masters of avoidable maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French embassy will provide her with asylum) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (a sum of 230,000 euros).
And it will announce that the Elysian Palace anticipates cases of hostages, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
“In the future, Iranians could arrest about 1,800 more French people living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days but is still being held in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to acquire material intended for the nuclear program, the spread of Majida Khakavanda is bad news.
Is France entering into a contract?
Iran's Liberation for the Liberation of Young French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrine, September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, he says, was not only "shocked by the judge's decision," but was looking for a way to counteract it.
“There have been talks between the presidential office and the minister of justice” (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the court’s decision,” he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under “limited” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysian Palace adviser dials the phone number, suspends the telephone headphone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Parisian buildings run by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian Palace is developing efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "uniques" in the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influenced" role of a "mediate".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that manipulation bears its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blessed" of French officials.
On what is the basis of such a measure of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is being asked.
“Despite their statement full of praise, French officials privately admit that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did,” he said.
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication “directs the validation of President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up Syria,” he said.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices both in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserving."
By “overtaking Syria’s role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate what praise it can get from playing a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also “to sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, no matter what."
"But we still thanked them."
“This should at least cause confusion and confusion between the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysee Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriots".
End online games after midnight for young korean
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival" that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior official in the ministry who has a draft law in charge, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit their daily access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible employee added.
It also provides free programs for people who request it, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "disabled" countries and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, which faces 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA is setting up host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicion of corruption is set up by FIFA’s executive committee in Thursday’s host country of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a choice supremely politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk exceeding technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal FIFA competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional backbone of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 World Cup will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping it will be able to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to occupy the United States or the Far East (South Africa).
The list of persons participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create a political economy.
Negotiations in the back are facing the risk that they will take up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA review report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee in an hour to vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of their country, the dwarf who has so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
The BBC set the crown on Monday when it sent a document that “infected” three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and bring the English leading actor with David Cameron into trouble in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move that succeeded his predecessors in the role of Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win for the London Organization of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be enough for England to add a new gloss to its name to the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the two Spain-Portugal do not lack the trumps of the already prepared stadiums, his welcome (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloud economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Any countermeasures against the British and doubts about the payment capabilities of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the championship will not be moved to Curich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal appeals only barely advanced to accuse the English press of members of the EC (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, they seem to be the logical favorite of the United States with their considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest-performing economy, the headquarters of Fifa’s main sponsors, seems to have a big push ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have drawn up a beautiful project.
But these candidatures appear to be premature for both countries, who jointly passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: China’s 2026 World Cup, which Fifa desperately wants, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out of the glove a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new landscaping, but these two countries pose more risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could puke for the flat-rate TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Observation (Security)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up the feeling that he was weighing.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But apparently it is not in good agreement with the participation in the secrecy associated with the presidential function.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts are constantly persisting.
In one sense and in the other.
In 2006, without a doubt, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that his third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious expression, assured that "it will be decided sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysium Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has been in a rather dire state.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 reduced the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement from him, not a statement.
This isn’t the first time he’s remembered the humorous tone of the presidential election.
“In the worst case, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His earlier statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the way to the candidacy for PS, on page one.
But this is not the entrance to the vault of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>n Royal, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to confess.
On the contrary, his 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat formations rather prematurely than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Fillon over the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and we don’t discuss it with the UMP,” they responded immediately and alerted people from the nearest vicinity of the prime minister.
"If he believes in possible defeats, he will not run," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
“He’ll still believe he can win,” says Alain Juppé, who is apparently on the same page.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in the year should have been an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, a notice of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of the overriding European demand obliges, and the institution for issuing securities will certainly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already so tense in the European securities markets today.
In this case, the price would be higher.
On the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up an active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of resolving the European state debt crisis.
She didn’t want to say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I welcome my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit as to his intentions, and satisfied with the fact that the programme was
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from the treasury by the European Central Bank has doubled to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion over the past week.
And thanks to the misunderstanding of the market participants, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt amongst the buyers on the market of anticipation of the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the price.
If the loan operation for more than three months has already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, the latter shall approach the unrestricted provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine it would change my program in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering short-term new tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the public debt market, “the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to revive the blue market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the exposure of European banks to euro area sovereign debt markets, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of paid performance of the states that are among the most fragile," a major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government has a bitter back
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation slowed down a bit, yesterday with the return of bond interest rates for 10 years.
Back to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "indissoluble" and that she was expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which was then demented by the participants.
In any case, on Tuesday, a deviation from long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points, causing some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he was "too busy" with the "stormy development of markets" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, her problem is the lack of growth and unexplainable fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is expected to be 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public finances deficit will represent another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (versus 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From here, the new list of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
“If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken,” said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not even short-term or long-term, because, through its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product of 2011, the NDLR), the effort to stabilize the demand in Italy is less than the effort required by the other countries of the European Union.
There is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the motion for a vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and could then start holding the elections, which are due to take place at the end of March.
Such a period would begin, which would be unsuitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
The Europeans are thinking about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, are obviously very supportive of their determination, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion concerning interest on European government bonds has brought water to the mill governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can’t talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Notation Authority Standard & Poor’s has announced that it could degrade the debt record of Portugal, a target that is most likely to be the focus of various speculations.
“Because in May, the real policy is not sufficiently transparent and clear, based mainly on banking systems,” says economist Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is running slower than market time.”
Aware of this disconnected link and the danger it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and to a wider extent with their counterparts from the G20, are developing very well.
This is due to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank will be held today.
The programme contains the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries focusing on markets (see above).
As for the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday left Singapore for Asia, in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this path is not to increase the funds, the land manager is thus preparing to achieve this goal.
The first issue of the FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries concerned, first and foremost, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join a strict measure with a rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid were different than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance even before they apply their own budget corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their long-term trust.
Finally, the capital participants in the European funds talk about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of markets with sovereign bonds.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not dare to re-enter the stockpile of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the very first plan of a trade in European sovereign debt, believe that a supplement of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "rather" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, complemented by EUR 60 billion to this day.
The Council, which has every chance of being tried in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and snowfall: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snowfall is still causing transport problems, especially on the roads of other classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have since now an orange emergency because of the risk of snow and snowfall.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have a declared orange alert, 18 already from Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls are causing problems in the north of La Gironde and les Charentes and poor snow in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected areas and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowfalls are big enough to cause transport problems and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy cargo - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the roads of other classes in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and the police recommend to leave with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned for Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are envisaged to restrict the carriage of goods by road.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adjust the driving nature of the vehicle".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10 percent at Orly on Thursday due to the expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services be contacted with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We remember in particular 23 billion of the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be launched, the State announced a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In theory, it is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual-source financing for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which examines the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing the tax from the Ile-de-France office.
First, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The output of this interest rate is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office, which already exists, "to be modernized to increase the revenue from it and to have this increase affected the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Overwhelming.
This is not listed in the text.
We're four billion miles away.
“It is clarified that these fiscal resources are joining the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital grants that will be mobilised by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion,” he explains.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will be added to the 2014 budget by 2013 alone.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion of the promised billion are still non-subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat turbulent parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on December 7.
Revengeful Hackers and Reasonable Investigators
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future of controlled regression.
But let's follow the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is by confirming the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (of any nation) consists solely of print scraps.
The "Extreme Discovery" of the American people about the way Berlusconi's sexual life is announced by what everyone could have read in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi's own) for months, and the caricature profile of Kad<0xC3><0xA1>lu<0xC3><0xAD>'s character has been enough for her.
The rule that secret documents may consist of only known messages is essential in the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to the bookshop that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, Templars or Zedn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>ch) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited-spirited) head of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be the editor of the Libération newspaper), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same that Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, has so much practice been made around the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the time when heads of state can call or fly on a plane at a joint dinner, have lost their form of reluctance with their reluctance and reluctance.
Any viewer watching investigative films very well knows that only out of hypocrisy is seemingly ignored. . . .
However, the fact that this is repeated in public, undermines the obligation of cover-up and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not an unforgettable one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor."
But let's move on from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, it was possible to conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the used highway and so on, became a citizen of the total victim of the deed of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now, that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but any citizen, or at least a hacker – chosen as the citizen’s guardian – can know all the secrets of power.
How can one maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an infinite secret (and an infinite secret will never be able to be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel would indeed be a mysterious infinite secret, because it is a mystery of the universe.
WikiLeaks didn’t make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of the saved power so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be similar to its publication on a poster painted on the corner of the street.
But it’s also quite clear that with current technologies, there’s no need to hope that you can keep your messages hidden by phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was traveling by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to be kept in private and sensitive messages in the future?
I know that for now my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who are transporting discreetly filling formalities along unchecked routes and carrying only those messages that they know to remember or rather hide hidden inside.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-sealed drawers: Overall, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving side-by-side, that is, backwards.
A century after a wireless telegraph marked a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wire-based telegraph (telephone).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed movie lovers to take the film step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CDs (digitals) allow only to jump through chapters, i.e. macros.
By means of speedboats we will reach from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication techniques to return to the carriages of horse-drawn carriages.
The last note.
Once upon a time, the press tried to understand the secret of the embassy.
Now it is the embassy that is requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Hacked Its Financing Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test compliance with promises for fast-locked financing (spoken fast-start or premature financing), implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been revealed
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (that is 420 million per year).
At the start of the COP16 the EU has drawn a great deal of attention to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: the developed countries and civil society would like all the developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading it to the right path to deliver on its promise of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without the detriment of the Public Development Assistance (ODA).
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what is meant by “new and additional”.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be the reference year: international funding has been maintained and it adds another 150 million to the three-year fast-start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France believes that funding for “all new projects” in 2010 is “new and additional”.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of the Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the overall level of France's support for developing countries may remain unchanged (or even be reduced) and must comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional" countries.
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of a loan can be proven for some investments that are profitable (often related to projects related to the reduction of emissions, based on more effective technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get, as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not hesitate to pay them
But France can only give the following justification: it "maintains" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% is a gift (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan to this extent.
Germany has claimed 46% of the proceeds, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) have fulfilled their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the absolute majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
It's a beautiful piece of ice cream!
To sum up, in its financing of "fast start" France operates with two hedges: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Despite spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, he is able to convince that he is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and negotiate on the basis of developing countries
The early funding chapter is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and fairness and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing contributions (the other key chapters currently being discussed): we will not avoid the question of "additionality" or how to charge for loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
The hope is therefore that everyone will be joining the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizetova, who will come to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international trust needed to be able to move forward in the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children will hate.
A 10-year-old child will one day be exposed to 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value considering the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in a superlative dish in a bowl of four tablespoons of flour.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sugarcane, have been analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and more.
The balance of the plate is staggering: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are listed among carcinogenic, possible or probable substances, and five substances belong to clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as a disruptive to the glands of the bladder.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we can see well that reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is infectious," he said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk themselves contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, presented in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same is true for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, where the study found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, steaks from ground meat, tuna in a can, and even mushrooms and chewing gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogen and chloroform was detected in the water from the tap of the analysis.
The steak from salmon to dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this “coke of contaminants” is likely to be underestimated,” the study says.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed to "face an emergency situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "increased civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
