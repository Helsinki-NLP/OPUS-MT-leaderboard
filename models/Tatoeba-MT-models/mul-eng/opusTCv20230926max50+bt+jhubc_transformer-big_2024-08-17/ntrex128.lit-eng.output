Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that “looks like dolls”
Some Members of the Assembly have decided on a proposal to change their name to MWP (Lit. Welsh Member of Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to laughter at the political level.
A member of the Labour assembly said his group was concerned that it was “going to deal with Twp and Pwp.”
Not for Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "crazy" and "pwp" means "what".
A member of the Plaid assembly said the entire group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his faction was "open" about the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
Mat valu<0xC5><0xB3> letter w is said to be similar to the English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the business of the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that received strong support for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP received the highest support during the public consultations.
Members of the Assembly are obviously offering alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may become a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on the reform of the scope and other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the plan for disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the system of the committee.
During the debate on legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on how they should be called.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to the territory of Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's intentions to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite over the name change, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said the vote would not be fair.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price that just needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During the difficulties of Harlem, the bells of St. Martin and other churches died
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, a bar and a church could be found on every corner,” Adams said.
“You don’t have one or the other today.”
He said he understood why the bar was gone.
“These days, people communicate differently,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
When it comes to churches, he worries that the money he gets from selling property will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multi-rooms with cooperative apartments, where people who would not help with the remaining shrines would live.
“Most of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these multi-storey houses will be white,” he said, “and therefore will speed up the moment when the churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved into these cooperative apartments will be white.”
Both churches were built in 1870 by the White Congregations, before Harlem became the black metropolis – the metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The first congregation of white Methodists emerged in the 4th century.
In the vicinity of the prayer, the black congregation took the name of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a minority boycott on 125th Street, the main Harlem store where blacks were refused employment or assigned to higher positions.
The building was heavily destroyed by fire in 1939, but as the parishioners of Johnson's spiritual father planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of the spiritual father Johnson and heir to the church of St. Martin, hailing the procession as the wings of the poor.
Experts, who have won a carillon in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linda. 18 years ago, he began playing a larger carillon at Riversaid Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not change his other musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complex history involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the Church’s laymen, others by the Bishopric of the Episcopal Church.
Zakristia – the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, in July expressed to the Bishops the concern that the diocese would “try to cut costs” for Zakristia, although it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain that the diocese lacks transparency.
In California, a 13-year-old was injured by a shark
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he was shot dead in California on the opening day of the Omar capture season.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinita near the Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammelis San Diego KSWB-TV said on Saturday morning that he had been chatting with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy call for help, and then returned with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “I’m pissed!
I'm intoxicated!"
Hammelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keys had been stolen.
“I started calling everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark floating in the water!’” added Hammelis.
The boy was flown to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was attacked by a boy.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Deepes added that the victim had suffered a bone-in trauma to the upper part.
Officials closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Svamio for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Deepes noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty departments of the universal store style, where specialists will work as consultants.
With the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion market in beauty, which continues to grow, and sales of fashion and household goods are falling, more beauty departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and if they get more sun in the future.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves, once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also gain more space in brand zones, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The mall is also re-publishing its range of Boutique make-up, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance Shop will try out discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croidone, South London, and the second of which will open later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
As a result of shopping online and the desire to buy small quantities every day from local essential goods stores, shopping malls have to strive more to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said that business outlets are increasingly looking like universal stores, as shopping mall networks are trying to fight off selling goods cheaper than Aldi and Lidl stores and are no longer selling goods at retail stores.
Sainsbury’s has included Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also installed a number of Habitat stores, as two years ago it bought both networks, which are said to have strengthened the sale of food products and their acquisitions.
A previous attempt by the mall to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical department ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 1st decade of this century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended the dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from the pharmacies located in the malls.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury’s sold the business to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network Celesio three years ago, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds’s contribution to this plan has been said to be adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Business Director, said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and convenient places, we are now an attractive beauty site that challenges the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones Is ‘Careful’ About Holly Willoughby Ceases 11 Million Pounds Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been “caught up” after TV host Holly Willoughby cut off a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for their home and accessories brand “Truly”.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old head of this morning’s channel, Instagram, said in a statement.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, upset the Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "engaged" when a gold TV girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Bakehamshire) said he was "disappointed" by the new deal, reaching up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, and that he would no longer have to pay for it.
The business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was assumed that it had to double the assets of H. Willoughby for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his summer clubs.
The source said “Truly” has been one of Holly’s most important priorities so far.
It should have been her long-term future, lasting the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave was a surprise to all.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
Marlou's headquarters is full of ready-to-sell warehouses."
Experts believe that The Morning, one of the UK’s most financially successful stars, the company’s exit could cost millions due to large investments in products, starting with pillows and candles and ending with clothes and home decorations.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
In 2016, Willoughby and Cappu formed Truly, and Jones joined the 52-year-old fight as president.
The couple are on holiday together, and Mr. Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company's shares.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace ITV’s I’m A Celebrity host, Antha McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: “We will not comment on his business.”
We talked hard and “we fell in love”
He joked about the media criticism he received about the comment, which some might consider "non-presidential", as well as about how he reacted positively to North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a short voice, the “newsman” said:
“I didn’t refuse anything.”
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was followed by a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, he said.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, are ongoing.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not receiving a "responsible response" from the United States to Shia.
He noted that the U.S. is instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
In his short speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We’re in a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: it ended missile tests, aided by liberating hostages and returning the remains of American troops home.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquake have devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, this has not been declared a national disaster – a necessary condition for the provision of international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that international aid is not needed, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
A spokesman for the national disaster agency Sutopo said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to find out if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly not prepared for the natural disaster.
Although the additions from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens, Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to have increased the number of lost lives.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Due to the natural disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
A hospital ship dislocated in Lombok, where the victims of the earthquake are being treated, sail to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
After President Joko Widodo’s collapse, he chose to restore Indonesia’s infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, spending money generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace to Joko’s administration, as he will be participating in the elections again next year.
Nothing is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslim-majority members hold a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands driven out of their homes, as the Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, rifles, and other simple weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge is immersing himself in a far-off draw in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League game after a 89th-minute knockout at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
With a score of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri transferred the ball to the former Sturridge about 30 metres from Chelsea Gate.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit the far corner.
High above the penalty area, the ball flies to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually crossed over the protruding Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get into a situation where I got the ball, and players like Shaqas are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to stay as long as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw a running Kante, I hit the ball with one shot and, without thinking too much, I just got drunk.”
After a 25-minute run by Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea finished 1-0 in the first innings.
During that attack, a blue striker in the middle of the square returned the ball to Mateo Kovacici and rushed to the Liverpool side.
In the middle of the square, the wall quickly collapsed.
He then sent a ball between his opponents to the invading Hazard in the penalty area.
Hazard wrapped the defenders and, through Liverpool player Alisson Becker, he pointed the ball to the net at the far corner with a left leg.
The Liverpool team will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday 15:00.
Chelsea will meet Videoton at UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
As the country’s disaster agency reported earlier Sunday, the death toll in Indonesia from earthquakes and tsunamis rose to 832.
A spokesman for the agency said at a press conference in Sutopo Purwo Nugroh that many people had been trapped in buildings that were destroyed by a 7.5-point earthquake on Friday that caused a 6-metre wave.
The city, home to more than 380,000 people, was devastated by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was fatally stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began this morning after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhede (Mercedes).
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. near Greison Miuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on anyone who has seen or heard people in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation stage is still early, but I would like to address all those who were near John Street in Berkenhede and saw or heard something suspicious that they would contact us.
I would also like to appeal to all, especially taxi drivers who could have recorded something as a video recorder, and to contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of the Berkenheda area and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, my friends, who were my acquaintances, came to the place of the event to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, as police have said they are informing the victims' closest relatives.
Greison Miuse, a taxi driver, has just tried to return to his apartment, but police say no one can enter and exit the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard how a police officer explained to one person that the entire territory is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, the woman appeared intoxicated.
She kept saying, “That’s so bad.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were standing in front of the fence on the inside, and another van on the outside.
Many officers stood on the inside of the fence and watched the multi-room quarter.
Anyone with information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statuettes strike the final blow to the "rewriting of history" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, which is responsible for the fanatical followers of the Cromwell Puritans.
However, Cromwell's company described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “At the time of the current discussions about the transfer of the statue of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace, it was inevitable that it would become a target.
Cromwell did not order and did not carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps it is not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Tom in the past century.
Created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, Cromwell's stunning image is a reflection of the 19th century's approach and a part of historiography of the figure that many still have time to admire.
Goldsmith’s The Sunday Telegraph said: “Many people, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, Cromwell was considered a defender of parliament from external pressure, and this, of course, was a monarchy.
Whether this is accurately illustrated, historians argue so far.
One thing is clear that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed a later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one side of this meeting.
His achievements, as the Lord has defended, are also worth mentioning and honoring.”
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer was killed.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwestern Chinese market.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found. He was covered in blood from the damaged arteries and lay next to pigs in Liupanshuya Market in Guizhou Province (South China).
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining (Changhai Province, China) was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs.
He said on Wednesday that he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province are planning to travel to markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin discovered the deceased and found an open door to the neighboring pig.
He said that there was a large hole in the pig whose mouth was filled with blood.
According to the report, the court’s expert confirmed that the 250-kilogram-weighted pig had caught the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and injured,” said the brother, who gave his name to Wu, in a statement.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the markets at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to slaughter his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his half-brother.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up so that it would no longer attack other people and held until police collect evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the market government are negotiating compensation for death.
Although few, but cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pressed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed until the animal was taken away by his wife.
After the 2012 pig hunts Oregon farmer, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig is usually not aggressive, but aggressiveness can lead to a blood taste.
“They’re just playful.
They like to sing, they're very curious... and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rose's 'Rich' Brings Heavy Rain to U.S. Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves through the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring plenty of rain to all of northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenia Bay (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the side of the Pacific Ocean begins to form a protruding low-pressure area and moves east, towards the US west coast. As Rose approaches the California peninsula on Monday as a storm of heat, she will begin to carry a large amount of heat into the US, in the heatwaves of the next year.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then, the humidity of the hot springs, interacting with the approaching low-pressure area, will bring in the coming days a vast amount of precipitation to the southwest.
In place of 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rain will cause a dangerous sudden flood, a stream of debris and a possible landslide in the desert.
Due to the high humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, it will drop from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour of precipitation.
Rainfall of 5 to 8 centimetres is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in much of Arizona.
Due to the positive nature of the warm rains, sudden flooding and rapidly worsening conditions are possible.
With the threat of heat storms, a particularly bad idea would be to drag into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain canyons can turn into scary rivers, and overcrowding would result in wind and dusty dogs.
The upcoming high-pressure area will bring a bit of local heavy rain to the southern coast of California.
It is likely to receive more than 1 centimeter of precipitation, which can cause a small flow of debris, and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first wet season in the region.
Some of the warm-up lions will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, and later rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
After heavy rains, the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah will deploy on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the United States, as the Arctic cools, but the heat zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this results in large temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday was a perfect example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from that of St. Louis and Di Moin (Ajova).
Over the next few days, keeping the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the North Eastern Zones, a warm October will occur with a high temperature of 27 degrees.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday should rise to 27 degrees, which would be around 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October will be higher than the average perennial temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the talk-shows of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the accusations of sexual violence by woman Christine Blasey Ford in the 1990s.
However, the political deadlock continued after broadcasters were interrupted by regular programs over Friday’s last-minute change: The Arizona senator drafted an agreement to conduct a week-long investigation into the city’s allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was attending a high school party, kidnapped her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh angrily testified that he was absolutely sure that it was not.
Nielsen said on Friday that more than 20.4 million people had watched the broadcast, possibly the same thing.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people watching television in the office.
To explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as would happen during recreational football matches or the Oscars.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose executives firmly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the first of all networks when the number of viewers during the day-long court hearing reached an average of 5.69 million.
ABC, which received 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, CNN – 2.52 million viewers.
There was also a great deal of interest after the court hearing.
The main character of Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him trying to lift him to a court committee meeting.
CNN filmed it directly with the naked eye when people were streaming it.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at the court committee meeting.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Courts Committee voted for Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said it would only do so knowing that the FTB would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which the Democratic minority called for the investigation.
Flake, speaking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation into the FTB over suspicions against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to leave the European Union of criticising people “playing politics” with Britain’s future and seeking to harm national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson went on to attack her so-called "Brexit" "Shakespeare" plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs", and said it was "absurd" that he was "deciding that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs".
Wayde's Sims Shooting Police Arrest Suspect Dytheon Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a person suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims dead.
Baton Rose Police Department said Dytheon Simpson, a 20-year-old man, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and police said that during the clashes, Sims had lost his glasses.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde.
The lawyer informs that the guarantee for his release is $350,000.
The Eastern Baton Rouge parish experts’ office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot to the head, pointing to the neck.
The department's merits are assigned to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area who helped during the investigation, after which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district's lawmakers for "cruelty and the enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-high boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5.6 points during the game and scored 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
“We think about it all the time,” Wade said.
Ugnikalnis splattered ash in Mexico City
Ash from Popokatepetli volcano erupted, which reached the southern outskirts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when the crater was caught in action and the gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center observed a number of collapses and tremors.
The photos on social media show a thin layer of ash covered with car windshields in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Cho<0xC4><0x8D>imilke.
Geophysicists observed that the activity of a volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital increased when a 7.1-point earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police clashed with the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with riot police for independence and thousands of people joined the protests to commemorate the first years of the Catalan opposition vote on the separation.
A group of masked separatists stopping the riot police was surrounded by eggs and powder paints. This caused a dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police took advantage of the traps to stop the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, the group for independence chanting "Unforgettable, unforgivable" met with Unionist protesters who shouted: "Spain is alive!"
The local press reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but which Catalan separatists are endorsing, the tension in the independence region remains high.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but the majority of those who boycotted the vote, who did not want to secede, had little voter activity.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured in the clashes last year when police tried to stop voting in electoral districts across the region.
The independence group set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police force from taking place.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer certain about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
“Last year, we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cheering for those who could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that last December in the regional elections a vital victory was ousted and difficult to achieve, the independence parties of Catalonia were struggling to keep up the pace this year, when many of their most famous leaders withdrew to volunteer or volunteer.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old police mechanic who filmed the protest on her phone, said the conflict was fuelled by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Orioles Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been serving time in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repressions demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry. Arrested men entering the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car re-entered their home in London.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car could also be fired with a barrel.
The men's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first win guaranteed victory
Livingston, who moved to the top level, surprised Rangers by forcing Ibrox's manager, Steven Gerrard, to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s strike proved to be very important as Gary Holt’s team instantly matched up with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated this season in the Premier League, and will meet with the leaders of the Hearts next Sunday, from which they will score eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers European League matches at home will be played with Vienna Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended his unbeaten series of unbeaten games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of defeat, as Kenny Miller replaced only last month.
Livingston's chances of a draw in matches with static guests
Even before the capture of Holt's team due to its persistence, causing Rangers various problems, it had long to be ahead.
At first, Scott Robinson broke through the gate and struck across the gate, then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halkett's head of the ball and he fell down next to the gate.
The hosts, allowing the Rangers to play in front, were not worried, because they knew that they could cause trouble for the guests by creating standard situations.
That’s exactly what was called a decisive blow.
The Rangers missed a free-kick and Livingston took a turn forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave the ball to Menga in a joint effort, and the one who stopped him earned a kick from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers for a longer period of time, but the hosts' defenses were insurmountable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly's job was almost non-existent.
Such a cowardly game continued in the second innings, though Kelly had to work to scare Alfredo Morelos into the gates.
Scott Pittman's Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor dropped his leg, and the ball sent by the Lithgow hit after the next Livingston standard position.
The passing ball was constantly bumping into Livingston in the penalty area, but each time it was exonerated, and two demands were imposed on the penalty – one on Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran into the field after the change, and the other on his way to the ball.
Analysis of Livingston's phenomenal performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
All in all, they were great and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff have hardly changed since returning to the top level, but it is worth it to give Holt a great deal of credit, as he set the team on fire on arrival.
There were a lot of heroes talking to him.
Captain Halkett played brilliantly, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall for not losing alertness.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
While under Gerrard, they play well, but this time they are much short of reaching their level.
They had little to do with decisive blows, and only once did they break through the defense of the hosts. A certain alarming call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Kelne has been accepted in various ways
Saturday (September 29th) was a sky of smiles and blue when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany that was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders fought over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Kelna to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have banned the gathering of 25,000 people from rallying in front of the mosque for security, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in their country.
Different protests show the dispersal of visitors: some Germans consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. When a cyclist died in a car crash
In London, a cyclist died when he was hit by a car.
The accident occurred near Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The driver of the car stopped, paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after Childers died on the street of another cyclist, a disgruntled offender, who then fled. This accident occurred about a mile (1.6 km) from Saturday’s accident.
The city’s police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed, and bus routes change, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officers were injured during the shootout
The prison ministry said six prison officials had been injured during a high-security crackdown on men in the prison.
The shooting took place at HMP Long Lartin prison in Vuster<0xC5><0xA1>yre on Sunday at 09.30 BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officers have been summoned to command this surrogate, which is attended by eight prisoners and is held in a single wing of the prison.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the scene of the incident.
A prison official said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were invited to attend.
Six staff members were treated for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that those responsible will be turned over to the police and, if possible, spend more time behind bars."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, are being held in HMP Long Lartin Prison.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot-fighting officers were deployed to the prison to control a serious riot, during which some workers were surrounded by billiard balls.
Hurricane Roza threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Solt Leik Sic (for dry areas it may be beneficial)
It’s not uncommon for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa, with her remaining energy, crashes through the desert southwest and causes a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already announced to observe a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, stretching to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that on Monday is getting closer with the rain, on Tuesday Rosa will be pulling straight to Phoenix.
According to the National Weather Service of Finland, “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depressions no more than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
With the latest National Hurricane Center models, it is predicted that April will fall 5–10 centimeters, and in some areas of Arizona, Mogolon Rim will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert's southwest, including the central Uolini Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach from 2.5 to 5 centimeters, and some may fall up to 10 centimeters.
For people who are not at risk of sudden floods, the rain of Roses can be a blessing, as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, for some these falls can be beneficial, as the afternoons are currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second-highest category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the entire peninsula of California, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is 619 kilometers south of the Euclid (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected to reach the Mexican coast with a heat storm force Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls that occur in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high flood risk.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest, Sonora is expected to reach 8–15 centimeters, but the possible thing is – up to 25 centimeters of precipitation,” Weather.com said in a statement.
Then Rosa will pull north through Mexico like a heat storm, later on Tuesday morning, reach the Arizona border already like a heat depression, and Tuesday night late night through Arizona will pull south towards Juta.
“The main danger expected from the Rose or its remnants is a very high amount of rain in the California peninsula, in the northwest Sonora, and in the southwest of the U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is believed that these rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods, a stream of debris in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsamer Norton. Arrested four people suspected of trying to kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Midsamer Norton area of the Excelsior terrace, around 04.00 a.m. according to the BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Eivo and Somerset police said they had arrested a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man in Radstogo district.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any material filmed on a mobile phone about what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “injured by the Democrats’ hatred, anger.”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his speech in Vilinge, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh during his candidacy process had "experienced the hatred, anger of the Democratic Party."
Kavanaugh on Thursday testified to Congress strictly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the court hearing about his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day how beautiful Kavanaugh was, how proud and brave he was.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a trusted reputation in the field of public services,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly recalled Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of the Republican midterm in the election.
“The most important election in our lives is five weeks.
“I’m not really involved, but I’m really involved,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats were trying to “oppose and hinder.”
A senior GOP chief aide to CNN said the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims continues to grow.
Authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, many of whom had been blown away by huge waves that swept into the beach when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the Palu Beach Festival, when a six-meter-high wave of collisions on the coast began to erupt. Many of them fatally detonated and destroyed everything that had been hoped for along the way.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
“When a tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster reduction agency, told reporters in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t drive alone, he pulled cars, cranes, houses, he hit everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the open sea ran at 800 km/h.
He said that some people stuck in trees to avoid the tsunami and so survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Photos from the air show that a number of buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridge was torn down and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was further hit by repeated blows.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said that the energy released on Friday during the particularly strong earthquake was about 200 times higher than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It was reported that the cunami could have strengthened due to the geographical position of the city, as it lay at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of the buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from the Dongal.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are moving to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that “it can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized without reporting that it had hit Palu with a wedge, although officials said the waves had been raised after a warning was issued.
In the shared social media favorite material you can hear a man standing on the upper floor of the building, who, after standing, shouts about the approaching tsunami for people standing down in the street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall breaks down on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the material being filmed.
As a result of the earthquake and the tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted, so communications networks around Palu were cut off, and authorities had difficulty in coordinating the provision of aid.
Authorities said the military in Jakarta and other cities had begun to send cargo planes with aid supplies, but the evacuated people still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseb<0xC3><0xA1> reported that when World Vision staff from Dongala travelled safely to the city of Palu, where workers were smothering themselves in the brezen tents built in the office yard, images were accompanying them along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take complex actions to provide assistance in the disaster, some people complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience had been banned from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, provision and staff employed from abroad can only be of assistance when the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still an accident at the provincial level,” Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said in a statement.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and the Pau tsunami, friends and loved ones of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the grim history of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days in the rubble near her mother’s body.
Indonesia's national paratroopers coach Gendon Subandon has learned the two missing Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia, the paratroopers.
Some of the prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandalay, were his disciples.
“As I am older in the field of paragliding sports, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon explained in detail how within a few hours, after announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this message traveled through the affluent sports community. He reluctantly sent messages using the WhatsApp app, to the contestants, who gave
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue specks.
"I think that means that messages have not been received," he said.
Newport on the Levee has stolen $26,750 from a ATM at the Newport on the Levee.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car was a beautician ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, the other man "runs away from the back of the Brink's employee" and steals to supplement the money bag.
According to the press release, witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the police of Niuport by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing changes to his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "Assume, formerly officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been called Ye for some time and named it the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, "Yandhi".
He has to replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name – Mr. West has said before that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘there’,” West said earlier this year, referring to the album’s name with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means unique, and just became Ye, which means our good, evil, confusion, reflection of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many well-known rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he made it a priority for the names Love and Brotherhood of Love.
Former West co-worker JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a snippet and large letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO for short) promises not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country’s 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never to use military forces to deter the Mexican population."
On October 2, 1968, at a time when left-wing student movements began throughout Latin America, representatives of the military on the square fired at a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has solemnly promised to support young Mexicans every month by subsidising students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
“As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government agencies released reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. is not a formal artificial intelligence strategy at all.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year, aiming to lead the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and are expected to make another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview this week with CNBC.
Lee, who has published his book “The State of Industrial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” this month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, investing in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence.
In the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s “Robotic Challenge,” and asked when the next one would be to help find more insight.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired bright universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think that for PhD students working in the field of artificial intelligence, green cards should be offered automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, China’s National Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocates money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Special Artificial Intelligence Committee would be established.
Earlier this month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced an investment of about US$2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia – an act that would solve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked its ambitions to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province in Macedonia, says its northern neighbor’s name means claims to Greek territory and has urged Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists say the name change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to take effect.
A referendum question was put on the ballot: “Are you for NATO and EU membership in the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying a price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said that they will respect the results of the vote and will make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonia’s Parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum on the name change in Macedonia to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled the chairs in front of the tents, which were built by boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads, not to enter through the door of the service,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can drill into others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the integration of Eurasia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO’s membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate reaches more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be behind, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said in a statement.
He said the result “yes” would be “a guarantee of our future.”
According to the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, the results of a poll published on Monday, the referendum should involve 30-43% of voters – less than the required voter activity.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, 57 percent of the respondents are ready to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent of voters plus one vote.
If the referendum did not succeed, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-war government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats Brighton's entire defense and profit margins
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, scored a 2-0 win.
The 65th minute of Aguero’s innings seemed incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before diving into the open field, he flew between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green t-shirted players.
He ran through one defender, before he surrounded several others on the edge of that Brighton penalty area.
He then transferred the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a shot from the penalty area, and this right-footed shot threw the ball to the right side of the gate network, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the head of City, told reporters.
He said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We were lucky that he won the race at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues to make the first move forward in these Premier League games.
The win was won in the 29th minute.
At the time of the attack, Aguero received the ball in the depths of Brighton Square.
On the left side of the square between the two opponents, he handed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball forward in a few spurs until Sterling turned to a further turn.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the gate just before evacuating from outside the square.
On Tuesday, 12:55 am, City will meet Hoffenheim Champions League group matches at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play friendly games with the "Rockies"
After the Nationals fell out of the open competition, there were no longer any serious reasons to lose again.
The rival Scherzers expect to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to stay in the open-air competition; in the national league West they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers at one point.
The Rockies, who defeated the Nationals in 5:2 on Friday night, have already secured a chance to get a comfortable base, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to run into the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where there will be a crowd of people and another team, will probably be at the highest level we’ll be able to reach this year.
Why don't you turn around?"
The starting line-up of the Sunday games team Nationals has not yet announced, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the standings of the match, took a shooting practice on Thursday and will take the position of the referee on the usual day of rest – Sunday.
Washington's right-wing statistics for this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 of the car.
He speaks a language in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican voter activity in the midterm elections, the president is indirectly concerned about the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we’ve achieved will be put on the scales in November.
The most important election in our lives is five weeks away.
"It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don’t care what they’ve hurt, what they’ve gone through to get power and control; that’s what they really want – power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “oppose and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, low-key, and wrong-minded people.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by mentioning Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein’s name, which caused a huge ovation from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you completed the document?
Oh, um, how.
No, um... no, I’m waiting for one — it was a really bad body language — the worst body language of all I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has lost its diversity of views.
They don’t tolerate open-minded people.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for distrust of me, I wonder if it should have been a surprise.
Finally, I am the latest of the liberal parliamentarians who have been told that I am undesirable – and that is for their opinion.
My colleague, Parliamentarian Joan Ryan, has received similar threats because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticizing me for not meeting Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want a lot of members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings will be productive."
For the most part of the eight years I was a local MP for the Labour Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of many meetings is not at all the same and the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if in general it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, and colleagues, who I thought were similar in political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees around and hold opinions that I would never agree with, whether about the EU or about the national consensus.
Whenever I speak publicly – and even about what – on social media, a plethora of abuses that promote my withdrawal are being condemned by the centre’s policy and I am told that I have no place in the Leiborist party.
And that’s not just my experience.
In fact, I was much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I commend the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure the avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most devastating things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with every procedure of "distrust" or change of the electoral system, this party is becoming less and less.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump, not to speak so loudly, and then with me “everything will be fine”.
That’s not why I came to politics.
Ever since I joined the Left Party 32 years ago as a student, the government of Thatcher’s deception, which in the true sense of the word has broken the whole class of my school, has led to better public services for those who want to see it.
I have never hidden my policies, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised in any way by my political opinions and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when a country falls into Brexit, which affects households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have for my constituents, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise that no threats of revocation or political expediency will prevent me from acting on your own convictions and convictions.

"Ayr"-"Melrose" – 38:17 Unstoppable "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two recent tests have turned out to be the final results, but there’s no doubt that Ayr has earned this triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent’s Premiership day games.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one not finished.
Finally, the victory brought them an unbeatable defense and well-spent opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We’ve put up all the tests over all the games that have taken place so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m really happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr has turned out well, the players have taken advantage of their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, which was successfully completed by Frazier Clem, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the number, and Baggot was not added.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage when, before that, in the middle of the race itself, he earned points and successfully completed the personal test, helping Ayr to unravel before the break with a score of 17:5.
However, Melrose's second innings started badly, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who ended Baggott's success, reduced the gap to five points.
The race was halted for a longer period of time, as Ruaridhas Knotts suffered a severe injury and was clearly drawn on the pitch. After the extended game, Ayr continued to roll forward when Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the player's excess, but Bruce Colvine's test was unsuccessful at the end of the fierce pressure.
The home team player returned, however, after Strunau Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Clem without the ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the penalty line for the ongoing Ayr crash site.
Cleimo successfully completed his test, as had already been done since almost the start of the game's renewal, after Kyle Rowe held David Armstrong's spear in the corner of the square and prevented the country's striker Gregor Henry from holding a fifth bathhouse.
Still Game star looks set to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be preparing to move into the housing and catering services sector, revealing that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes and plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of this league, and it seems that Kieran is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Officially, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, although sources at Scottish Sun noted that Kieran was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow’s “blissful restaurant business.”
“We belong to the sea”: Bolivia, who is imprisoned on land, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the ocean
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters of La Pase.
There is a flag of ocean blue floating on public buildings.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is decorated with a slogan: “We legally belong to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
Throughout the land in captivity in Bolivia, there are still vivid memories of the access to the ocean, which we are bleeding in the 19th century in the conflict over resources that Chile had to sacrifice – alive and long again in the Pacific.
In recent decades, the hope of prosperity has now been greatly strengthened, as after five years of consideration, Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October.
“Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to achieve positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the announcement of the TTT decision on the big screen, hoping that the Hague tribunal will make a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s state access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, an Indian awaiting a controversial election campaign for re-election, is also very interested in what will be the end of Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that it is unlikely that the court will make a favorable decision for Bolivia – even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no powers to define the territory of Chile and has indicated that no possible outcome of the negotiations will be found.
The fact that the TTT decision will be announced only six months after the last arguments were heard hardly shows that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile’s international law expert.
And even if Bolivia managed to push something, the last four years could have blocked it back.
“This issue of access to the sea was illegally raised by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s good will have been destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile have at some point extended the conversation, but after all this will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was passed unusually quickly.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and end the 139-year-long disagreements that seek mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the issue of the sea as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never be denied the right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear deterrence is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never give up nuclear weapons if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, for which the leaders of the rival countries agreed during a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, apparently, was planning to renew a stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "Utopian dream" is that by continuing sanctions and rejecting the declaration of the end of the Korean War, North Korea could be parked at some point.
Washington will refrain from agreeing to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take credible counter-offensive actions.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon an arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to complement your hat collection or fully protect from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne’s 2019 spring and summer collections showcased a wide range of eccentrically large headwear, and he simply embellished Paris Fashion Week’s viewers with his style.
These particularly impractical hats won the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentino’s distinctive work was a huge hat of body color, decorated with a broad, feather-like edge that enchanted the mannequin’s head.
Other non-standard-sized accessories have been made with gemstones topped with peacocks, magic hats and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks to Helovin at the same time.
Many of the colorful masks were tied in the lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member's costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other reminded of the melted ice rink.
And if you’re having sex with this huge-sized fashion trend, don’t ask.
Style experts suspect that these huge overcoats can get into stores.
The huge hats became popular with La Bomba’s high heels, and the two-legged hats were worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand, created by highly impractical hats that conquered all social networks, has released another huge piece on the podium – a brown beach basket, almost the same size as a swimsuit with a towel.
The red-coloured raffia basket, decorated with raffia corners and a white leather handkerchief, became an exceptional highlight of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris Fashion Week.
Music stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL: "I think the next summer the huge hats and beach bags will come to the store because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the custom-sized accessories in the pores."
John Edwards: “Payment of loans is a very important skill for the citizens of the world”
The independent schools in Scotland have improved academic achievement records unsolved in 2018 and have once again demonstrated exceptional test results, which have only been further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other communities.
With a total of more than 30,000 students studying throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to provide its students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement a planned school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and are deliberately chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you can talk to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to weave relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year’s exams, we can say that languages excel at the top of popularity and in independent schools are marked by the best grades of maintenance.
In total, 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A rating.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest grade A during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of pupils received the highest grade A, and 69 percent of pupils received the highest grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider the payment of foreign languages to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an optional subject, are now considered to be as important as the main subjects in the programmes of independent schools and elsewhere (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, it was found that, for all the reasons why employers were difficult to fill their jobs, 17 per cent had insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to be ready for their future careers.
Since the ability to work in the future will depend very much on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career a person would choose, by paying for a second language, in the future he will be much more prophetic than others if he had these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who learns a few languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and the French language was the only language in which more than 15 percent spoke.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By paying for a few languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages in which it is taught.
A lot of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while other languages are taught, which are considered to be the most important languages for the United Kingdom, considering the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in an independent school, with training staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are prepared to create an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that, in today's world business environment, languages remain vital to the country's future, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and outcomes for young people in Scotland.
This must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
There is not much left for fans to see as LeBron James kicks off the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's season-opening competition with Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
But how many minutes you play is still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Short language in West Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign this evening in Wilinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump languages next week, including in friendly-minded areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval of the Supreme Court’s suspension procedure, Trump is seeking to focus support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans have threatened to lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time will Trump speak tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump language in Wilinge, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube broadcast.
The brief is likely to touch on this week's Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as she has come under a lot of strain over suspicions of inappropriate sexual behavior when the Senate voted to suspend the candidate's filing until the week before the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain a bit of strength as they approach the November elections.
Trump’s campaign representatives therefore say that the aim of these five meetings next week, as reported by Reuters, is “to energize volunteers and supporters, trying to protect and expand the majority that Republicans have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible because the very hot campaign season is starting,” a Trump campaign spokesman said, without trying to reveal his name.
"This evening's speech at the Wesbank Arena in Willingo should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's candidate for the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is ranked low on the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to the top of the ratings,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team surrenders in the military and hopes to enter Sunday’s unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quarter-finals can be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is completely conceivable, but the players really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
Whose side is it on now?
"They've scored six points, and now they're four, so I guess we can consider it to be such a success," Jordan Spieth said, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe leads, has a four-point lead and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, according to Spietho, has faded and they do not lack it, not to mention the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each collected three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from beginning to end and inexorably first.
In order to finish the fourth match in a straight line, Thomas scored two points out of two possible points in a row.
His strike, which they won in this match in the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar blows, which seemed to say that the end of the American team is not yet over.
“We just need to focus and take care of our games,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players is left to play separately.
By the end of the year, there were 18 winners.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but charming couple from Europe have collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
“Moliwood was the only couple who needed additional strikes not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
This course of events and the reaction of the gurgling spectators only confirms that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to reach such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, having secured the last sunsets in Europe, will have the "Gulfs" on the horizon.
It would be nice to have both at the same time.
It is still too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero when he was paired with Alexa Norena.
An additional blow and two doubles additional blows during the first nine pit bull series pushed Spain and Sweden into trouble, from which they were unable to escape.
No one will be out of trouble on Sunday.
The four-ball and four-quarter matches are so interesting to watch for the interaction between the pairs, for the advice they give and do not give, and for the fact that the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team, so it came to the finals decisively in the lead, but this fourth stage also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter's spine, which some, especially in countries, have doubted.
The last day of the Ryder Cup competition Europe leads 10:6
Europe’s last day of the Ryder Cup will come with a heavy lead after Saturday’s fourth stage, leading against the United States 10:6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario, the duo continued to change the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard-fought Tiger Woods and taking the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side to save the trophy, which had been lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning quarterfinals against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a 3:1 result.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarter-finals when it won two matches but failed to overcome the points lead.
Jim Furyk’s side needs eight points from Sunday’s 12-unit matches to keep the trophies in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, when Molinari and Molliwood doubled after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches at the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they unsurprisingly shattered the confidence of Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in an even better 5:4 result.
Woods, who did not beat two Saturday matches in this way, at times showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his matches in the quarterfinals, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning quads and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the quads; they defeated 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world rankings.
With a pleasant, gentle windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe wasn’t all about butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the American cartel by winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they scored an uneasy 2–1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in the fourth match they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3, failing to score in the first two goals.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the teams managed to withdraw a four-point lead by going into individual matches, although the Furyk side would have had enough levels to keep the trophies.
Although two days were in second place, Sunday's success from them seems to have fallen.
North Korea says it will in no way stand up unilaterally without being able to trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would certainly not unilaterally give up on nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
"But we have not received a similar response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not in any way be the first to unilaterally conflict."
While Ri repeated North Korea’s already heard complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps to take it, his statement ruled out that he would completely reject the idea of a nuclear deterrent.
Ri recalled the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first meeting of the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "Korean Peninsula disarmament" and Trump promised to secure North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also refusing to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea, the report said.
“The United States demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to reach its goal by means of coercive methods, even by rejecting the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“To think that we can be parked under sanctions is the same thing as having utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have been a matter of concern."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that when Trump called Kim a “missile lord” with a suicide mission, North Korea’s missiles to the U.S. were completely inextricable.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, has urged Kim to take bold steps towards disarmament, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until the North Korean crisis comes to an end.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no timetable for it, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be resolutely continued without any concessions until the full final nuclear disarmament confirmed by the evidence is carried out."
The Security Council has voted in favour of North Korea’s sanctions since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with the U.N. General Assembly behind bars and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to blow up the ground for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has been unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that all the progress had been made to ensure that North Korea announced in a few hours that it had made “gangsteric demands.”
North Korea has pledged to dismantle its missile base and nuclear complex during a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim said that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking are security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and would shift to normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn Enough to Retire
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more, aiming to combat the growing cat culture in their studies, using caffeine and not sleeping at night.
One academic found that in the best university in the world, students often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham Scythe, a specialist in women's hospitals, prepared a course that, according to him, is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I being told about this only now, in the last year of study?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, improve the overall self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Services Department, said the university decided to offer this course when it became apparent that students were very sleep-deprived per week.
The duration of the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a picture of the common room, where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, workouts and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects the results of sports and how important walking to sleep routines.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.

“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Czeisler.
The belief culture of not sleeping at night, he says, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the growing problem of lack of sleep.
“To make sure that he slept well enough and qualitatively, there should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep switches the brain into a sleep mode, so students are constantly feeling overwhelmed.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when he attended one of his subjects last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for the entire student campus for an accessible course.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-grade students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep, just like when you’re walking, and to protect against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light-emitting diodes, as they can extinguish the glow of your bellies in the blink of an eye.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Mengos rape upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to overcome a weakened Steven Gerrard score of 1:0.
Ibrox was hoping to win their first victory in a 4–1 St Johnstone victory in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games and now the last team is eight points behind the far-flung "Hely escaped".
Menga played for the remaining seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the game Rangers did not see a chance to equalise the result.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third, and Hibernian has only one draw left.
But Rangers’ concerns don’t end there, as it’s likely that the tribular butter thing hit the side judge Calum Spencui’s head and hurt him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed Ayr to circumnavigate and led to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt was confident of the same fate that took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations brought up opponents at every step.
The Rangers dominated by controlling the ball, but with Livingston doing more.
They were able to capture the second minute when Menga passed the ball in a close-knit shot to Allan McGregor's invading Scott Pittman, but safety broke his chances by pointing the ball away from the gate.
After Keaghan Jacobs' free-kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his opponent Alan Lithgow pleaded for the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the games was just a game of hope, not a game of faith.
Alfred Morelos thought he deserved the penalty in five minutes when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson in a complaint to the Columbian rented a hand.
The Rangers managed to hit only twice in the first innings, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's blow to the head or by the gentle fall of Ovie Ejaria.
Even though the 34th minute innings may not have matched the pace of the game, no one will dispute that they have earned it just for the effort.
“Rangers” and again failed to overcome the clutches of Jacobs defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who retained his nickname and handed it over to Manga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately yielded fruit when the national guard played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive run-off hit.
Livingston brought guests to the game they liked – with the long-distance transmissions of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could eventually increase their surplus, but McGregor defended against Jacobs' strike after Lithgow's submission from the corner.
After a change to the pitch, Rangers player Glenn Middleton appealed again at the end of the game for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson did not deny it again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years and a LOT... That day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
Geiger invented the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, according to which the device was later created, is known by the name of the Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the world of science, and later a hit in popular culture, when the 1950 film Bells of Coronado featured cowboys not particularly reminiscent of scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is this behind?”
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear how the atoms work, touch the radioactive effect on the minerals.”
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look bad for cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them.
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then the cells can "see" the proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and are injected back
The vaccine tested gave many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman who was treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, died of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins typical of HER2 cancers, and then injecting them back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and rectum,” Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when the immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to adapt to cancer cells, has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West launched the Trump-supporting tirade wearing the MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL show.
Good thing it didn't end.
After a gruesome performance on Saturday Night Live, viewers of the studio embarrassed Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the record "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and voice support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, ‘How do you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism had bothered me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon fired from Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, the footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rocks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get away from West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that the back of his head covering had discomfort.
“They were staring at me behind my back.
He said not to go there with such a hat.
They were hiding from me!
They said I reached the bottom," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> My father has his superman’s hat and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love.”
His remarks were at least twice the cause of dissent in the audience, and the members of the SNL broadcast appeared to be caught up, according to Variety. One person told the media: "There was a deadly silence throughout the studio."
West was asked to urgently replace singer Arian Grande as her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West greatly admired his performance, during which he performed the song "I Love It", wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter the following message: “To one of the bravest spirits: I’m AWARE OF A RESPONSIBLE MINE.”
But the head of the conversation, Karen Hunter, posted on Twitter that West was simply “being himself, and that’s incredibly amazing.”
“But I choose NOT to be a person (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his ‘me’), whose convictions are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first developer to change his name, but went the same route as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogga was originally called Snoop Lion; the music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accusations of murder with knife in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after he was stabbed to death in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balikhamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Next Harington criticises a distorted view of manhood in the so-called "wars of the world"
Another Harington was famous as the sword-washing character John Snow on HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages, The Civil War.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a cat hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the distorted manhood problem in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently ran a 31-year-old colleague, Rose Leslie, the star of the Civil War, admitted that the topic “touches him hard.”
“I feel that this topic is now very touching to me. Where did we make a mistake in raising manhood?” he asked.
“What do we teach grown men to deal with such problems?”
Others believe that partly because of this distorted wave of manhood could be responsible for television, as it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is natural, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they have to mark this type of manhood?
I think that’s one of the important questions of our time: how do we change that?
We’ve made a mistake somewhere with young men.”
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any of the "Summer Wars" trailers or sequels when the series ends the next summer, saying that "he already has quite a lot of battlefields and horses".
Since November Next will be filming Sam Shepard's True West in a modern version. It is a film about the film's directors and his brother's robbery.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that had happened to him in the making of The Battle of Sosto, where he met his wife Rose.
“In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
The Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Fantastic Series was played by Igrit, the object of love for the character John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a family owned property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases of the disease
China has reported an increase of 14 per cent in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But so the number of people infected with HIV dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over time, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a common issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized back in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually lead a woman.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to improper protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking Republican senatorial data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed the allegations were made by the ultra-right wing experts and the website.
“A lie, a lie, and a lie again,” Waters said on his Twitter account.
It was reported that U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatcho, both from Juto, were also home addresses and phone numbers.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitoline Hill at a time when the Senate was considering allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The missing information appeared much later, when the three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
“Conservatives’ websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, have reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records related to Waters’ office and have been disclosed to Waters staff members,” the company said in a statement.
“These unfounded suspicions are absolutely false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and safety have been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions is by no means responsible for the deletion of this information.
These baseless suspicions are absolutely false and absolute lies.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, as well as from former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This negation sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-esteem to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not doubt the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischeris seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaughui, who was accused of appearing too bad at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who was part of the midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true, if not a lie," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the organisers are clear,” she continued, “that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all, without exception, to my employees.”
Review of the comedy "Johnny English Strikes Again" - a breath-taking spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for Brexit quotes in any British film. The same can be said about the revival of the action-snippets comedy franchise Johnny Inglis – Johnny Inglis – the "John Inglis" was started to show in the spring of 2003 and the autumn of 2011 in the spring of the year.
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction about how we have obviously grown into a new opportunity for national exports?
In any case, incompetent John Inglis has a second opportunity to bring the unpleasant truth to the surface with wide eyes and rubber face <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> the very name clearly shows that this comedy is intended for non-English-speaking regions of the cinematographer.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, while claiming to be a luxury, has also acquired some of the qualities of Inspector Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Byne's traits and a slender resemblance to that man, appeals to the charm of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He’s also a bit of a character-driven about a traveler and a mysterious man, sparking the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this latest John English film, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when John Inglis approached the helicopter, tossing a medieval suit and armor, and the art rotor slid into his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedy talent is obvious, but the humor itself looks breathless and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and “Mission Impossible” bravely insert elements of the comedy.
Humor is as if it were more for children than adults, and John English's unexpected adventures do not seem to me as inventive and peaceful as Atkinson's silent jokes playing Mr. Byn.
At the moment, the most common theme is that the UK was in serious trouble.
A cyber-attack has successfully infiltrated Britain’s highly secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent’s outrage – an overly insignificant role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister’s Cup, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from suffocating political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Theresa May’s character expresses everything she can, but there’s no good material in the script.
Wise counsel informs her that the identity of all her agents is revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you will have to apply to John Inglis himself, who is currently working as the principal of the school in some sort of quirky institution, but is providing illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when the Rock Academy offered a "Scho"
The Englishman is sent back to Waterloo to discuss the extraordinary situation and there he meets his common Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the submarine chief, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high school girl, seems to be underutilized.
Then Batman and Robin, able to stir up all the affairs of Her Majesty's Secret Service, takes action again and meets Olga Kurylenko, played by the fatal beauty Ofelia Bullekova.
A charismatic billionaire is dangerously turning his head at the prime minister, saying he can solve the problem of British computers, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, wreak havoc on a luxury Voltaire yacht, and English begins a complete anarchy by trying to take advantage of virtual reality headsets to get acquainted with Voltaire.
All the stops were clearly reserved for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, all this is well reminiscent of children's television.
It's pretty average.
As with other John English films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: can’t even the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies creating a plan for Britain to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the heads of companies to share in savings accumulated as a result of the artificial intelligence (DI) revolution, giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time report the same amount of pay at home.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to advance the country's development to workers in a favourable direction.
The transition to a four-day work week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Labour Party sources, The Sunday Times, said: “A review of the policy provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party has also promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day week is not a party policy and is not considered in the party.”
Six-party government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the field of economics at last week's Labour Party conference.
Mr McDonnell has said he is committed to restoring power from “invisible dictators” and “profit hunters” in communal services companies.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their shares, because, having taken a look at the debris made, the government of the Liberals may deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and to set up included equity funds so that 10 percent of private sector companies’ capital would be transferred to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the 60 Minutes question whether an FTB investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion
When the FTB conducted an investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaughui, a final vote was postponed for at least a week on whether to appoint him to the Supreme Court, so the question arises whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could have an effect on any Republican senator from this.
Scott Pelley, a 60 Minutes radio correspondent who appeared in the ether on Sunday, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FTB would find out something that would change their minds.
Apparently, Senator J. Kennedy holds a more liberal view than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
“As I said at the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations appeared, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He replied decisively, firmly, unequivocally.”
So Graham’s opinion would seem to be unchanged.
“When I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, there should be a lot of accusations,” he said.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett is categorically negative,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one can confirm what she calls it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think there will be anything new.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
New York City will host the World Citizens’ Festival on Saturday – an annual music event that showcases an impressive number of stars and aims to eliminate poverty in the world with no less impressive goals.
For the seventh year, the World Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message of the 20th anniversary.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012 and is a continuation of the Global Poverty Reduction Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people struggling with it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to carry out various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, calling a phone call, or asking for further information.
But do the citizens of the world successfully achieve this goal? 12 years remain until the expected deadline.
Will the intention to reward people with a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Perhaps this is just another example of so-called clitivism, fictitious activism – people think that will really change the situation when they sign an online petition.
According to the organisers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters, encouraging the achievement of a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced 37 billion US dollars worth of commitments and policy strategies that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group listed 390 commitments and statements that were encouraged by the group’s actions, of which at least US$10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
According to the group’s calculations, almost 649 million people worldwide have already been directly affected by the funds secured.
Among some of the key commitments could be mentioned “The Power of Nutrition” – a partnership of investors and executives operating in the United Kingdom, which aims to “help children grow up and reveal all their potential” in the field of nutrition.
“With the support of the UK governments, sponsors, governments of countries and such as you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that such social injustice as food insufficiency becomes a past,” said London’s Ambassador to Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, in a televised speech.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 calls to improve maternal and child nutrition in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the “Energy Power” project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
By answering one of the FAQs on your website, which asks “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The world’s citizens say: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the big movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performers at this year’s event in New York. The event will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. can use the navy to block Russian energy exports.
“If necessary, Washington can use the navy to mislead Russia’s energy into reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s participation in Syria, especially when it is acting on a legitimate government invitation, is a pretext used to explore new energy markets.
“I think that Russia is interfering with the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
“The United States can do that with the Navy, it can make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, it can carry out a blockade, it can make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke told the participants of the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, not a profit group called the US "energy consumer voice".
He then compared Washington’s methods with those applied in dealing with issues concerning Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a bigger or smaller balance that would replace the fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared to the Trump administration on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, offering Europe's consumers a much cheaper option.
Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from a flawed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a free man in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-worth Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the root cause of Washington’s opposition to this project is only economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received hostile reactions from Germany, it reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly disagree with the interference of a third country in our energy supply affairs,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry federation (BDI), said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president in 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During the meeting, Masa<0xC4><0x8D>usetse E. Warren confirmed the possibility of running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they have to go to the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential election.”
During a meeting at the town hall, Warren called on President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about the way Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a Twitter post on Friday that “it is imperative that an FTB study be conducted before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own state voters believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Safolk's Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's likely voters say the senator should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that more support is received by former governor Deval Patrick – 38 percent support his potential candidacy, and 48 percent speak out against it.
Others discussed the names of the Democratic Party’s nominees for the 2020 election – former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump's meeting about Track Palin's traumatic disorder
26-year-old Track Palin, who joined the war service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after a domestic violence incident, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who feel the effects of a traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers with whom they are coming back,” she told reporters at the rally.
Palin called his arrest an avoidable truth. She said that his son and other war veterans "returned a little bit changed, they returned with a firmer heart, they returned doubting whether they would get respect for what their fellow soldiers and lions are."
He was arrested Monday in Vasily, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as on charges of reporting obstacles to family violence with a gun and in the presence of a vigilante, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasily Police Department.
The Region of 18 States and Colombia supports the opposition to the new asylum-seekers policy
The 18 states and Colombia counties support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to the victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
In Washington on Friday, representatives of 18 states and the region made comments on amicus curiae to support the challenge of asylum-seekers’ policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiffs’ full name in the Grace trial against Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union initiated against federal policy, is undisclosed.
She says her partner “and his gang members” raped her, but U.S. officials on July 20 rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s state-sponsored lawyers described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum applications, as states, dealing with the problems of permanent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted the Immigration Appeals Board’s 2014 decision to allow non-documented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Carlos Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is unobserved by decades of state, federal and international laws in force.”
"Federal laws require that decisions on asylum applications be made in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and this prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae notes.
In this remark, the lawyers also say that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering the country harms the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to engage in business and “make the necessary work services”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and the victims of gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of belonging to a race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or certain political views," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The provision of asylum has never been aimed at solving all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Twice the number of victims in Palu, desperate to find the remaining survivors
The situation of the remaining survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says Risa Kusuma, 35, calming her baby son, who has been kidnapped by the Palu evacuation center.
“It’s not that fast to carry more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect contaminated items with water, try to save what can only be found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and a damaged 7.5-point earthquake hospital is in a drought.
Some of the wounded, like Dwi Haris, have suffered back and shoulder fractures, and have been discharged outside of Pal’s army hospital, where patients continue to be treated outside for severe repeated blows.
His eyes lit up with tears as he told me how in the hotel's fifth-floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, he felt a sharp earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
“It seems to me that I’ve broken through the wall,” Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope she’s healthy.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Fearing Propaganda Advertising
A week ago, when the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, boosting bilateral U.S. and Chinese trade profits, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned an appendix to the purchase of the State of Iowa’s Des Moines Register and accused China of influencing the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China accuses of.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new phase of a strengthening Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a deepening trade war, and both countries are grappling with tariffs on imports of each other's goods.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China’s response tariffs were applied to exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a longtime governor of Iowa and one of the largest exporters of agricultural production to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China was “increasingly reluctant to print propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the freedom of speech and the press in America and has ordered a paid advertising report from the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the meantime, you won’t find conflicting voices in the local Beijing press office, and you won’t create a real image that reflects the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under heavy pressure from China’s Communist Party,” he said.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers has slipped away from the proposal to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: as midterm elections near, Kavanaugh’s fiasco threatened by Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been charged with several counts of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would receive a negative response during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying that they want to carry out the vote.
Such things cannot be taken away later," Grant Reeheris, a professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Reeheris said he was doubtful whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last minute calls to launch an FTB investigation would be enough to calm down the bad voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November,” the Washington newspaper said on Friday, according to senior adviser and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “November is approaching!” during a Senate demonstration, when Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, the chip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross the border,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst at the news site.
People say that she was already so strong, and they are right.
But it could still strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, even if they don’t like the president, often just don’t vote.”
Even before Ch. B. Ford publicly making statements when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment against a candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts said that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, it could lead to outrage.
"The Republican Party has caused a lot of confusion," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but also about how Republicans handled the situation and how you treated Mr. Ford,” Guy told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the shows of B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford, although it still gets a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or most likely believe in Ch. B. Ford’s shows, and 35 percent say fully or most likely believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was indeed or probably lying when giving shows, and only 30 percent said the same about Ch. B. Ford.
The FTB is currently investigating allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, said in a statement.
Mr. B. Ford took an oath last week to show the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party they attended while studying at the University of Jeila on Dec. 9.
Web Developer Plans to Create New Internet to Oppose Google and Facebook <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The creator of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor Inrupt is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and what information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is to control the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the starter.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application, which is based on Solid technology, allows people to create their own online store of personal data (POD).
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can access.
The company calls this the authorization of the person through the data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, IBM’s purchased security platform, several programmers hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google about the changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee said in a statement on Saturday that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a consortium established by the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions about internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Internet Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel huge optimism about this new era of the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vannas – Priest awarded with the Victoria Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown, the only clergyman of the Anglican Church was honored, awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lt. Col. Pastor Bernard Vann was awarded the prize on September 29, 1918, during the attacks on Belenglis and Lucerne.
Unfortunately, after a quarter of days, the sniper was shot, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded the highest level of British Army award.
During the parade, two grandchildren opened a memorial stone in the county of Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vannas, said that the fact that the stone was uncovered just 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize was “wonderfully symbolic”.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kenten Canal "in the form of a highly-exploded smoke, with the severe spread of conditions and automatic fires."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and "especially gallantly" led the line forward, and then one himself attacked the situation and killed three group fighters.
The German sniper, Lieutenant Colonel B. Vanna, was shot dead on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vannas, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "whatever, to whom he himself will never be equal, but at the same time humility is a very inspiring thing."
After the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vannas helped the prisoner.
Micheal Vannas said it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade, adding: "A true hero's member shows the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans didn’t go to sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet “Kaulyte Pepa”
Imagine: you don’t go to bed all night to see the Bellator 206, but you don’t get to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose poster, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a fight, and after watching the UK broadcast, the film “Kiaullyt<0xC4><0x97> Pepa” was interrupted.
Some spectators, to put it mildly, were not surprised, because it was precisely because of this struggle that they did not go to sleep until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the patients called the change to the broadcast a children's animated film "somewhat sick joke."
“According to the rules set by the government, such content is inappropriate at 6 a.m. in the morning, so the program for children had to be turned on,” Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, was asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, "Damn Pepe."
Bellator's president Scott Cocker said he would try to adjust the schedules in the future, taking into account the audience in the UK.
“When I think about repetition, it seems to me that maybe we could do it,” Cocker said.
“But at that time it’s six o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to solve it until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this issue.
Trust me, when you change the broadcast, you exchange a lot of messages, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a matter of government.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of battles to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give more, but just failed.
It's an unsuccessful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Unselfish About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water climber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to pursue success.
24 The athlete claimed only at the primary school that he understood that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time in Lauren Laverne's talk show on Radio 4, Desert Island Discs, he said he took public talks about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that being a father was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent leader of this long-term charity, left work for several months because of the illness.
At the first L. Laverne wedding ceremony, which guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley said growing up feeling less than everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: “To this very day, that sense of inadequacy and inadequacy has been an incentive to give me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that it was worth it so as not to disappoint the environment when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, taking part in this year’s Commonwealth Games, took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he started talking about it publicly because he felt he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he wanted to give others that hope.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – was a surprise to him.
Daley married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but says the age difference has never caused any problems.
According to T. Delay, when so many survived being so young – in his first Olympics he was only 14, and still three years after the cancer his father died – it is difficult to agree on anything of the same age, but having experienced the same height and low.
In June, the couple became the parents of their son, Roberto Ray Blacko-Daley, and the perspective of T. Daley, according to him, changed completely.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said the most important thing is for me to win a gold medal,” he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal.”
The son's name is the same as grandfather Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto Daley, the father did not want to reconcile with death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not inviolable,” Daley said.
After a year, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that I’ve been dreaming about it my whole life – jumping into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song for the wire – Heather Small’s creation “Proud”, which relieved his feelings while preparing for the Olympics and still pleasantly caressing the skin.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 p.m. in the British summer time.
After losing form, Dr. Mickelson missed Saturday’s Ryder Cup tournament on his stomach.
American Phil Mickelson will reach the record on Sunday as he has already taken part in the Ryder Cup tournament 47 times, but in order for it not to be an unsuccessful event, he will need to improve the form very much.
Dr. Mickelson, who is already playing for the 12th time every two years in Saturday’s fourth-round on-the-scenes competition, is the captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the case in the United States, the five main winners spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest improved their technique on the pitch in order to correct the playing obstacles.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal player in the former Le Gold National squares, with a long row of rough grasses that are extremely unfavourable to unreal hits.
In addition, as if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, in the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, Dr. Mickelson plays against the highly-targeted British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, won all four of these matches on his own.
If the four-pointed Americans manage to start the approaching 12-unit match well, Dr. Mickelson’s match can become absolutely crucial.
Furykas expressed confidence in his player, but probably could not speak otherwise.
“He understood the role he played today, he leaned over my back, and with his arms around him he said he was ready to play tomorrow,” Furykas said.
He doesn’t lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most prestigious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t know he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will improve Nick Fold’s record and become the most-played athlete in the Ryder Cup.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the height of his personal records.
Dr. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven levels, but Fury says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, he likes to laugh at people, and he’s a great guy to have fun with in a team room,” he explained.
“I think it was fun for younger players to hang out with him this week as well, it was good to watch it.
It’s much more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that heavy weight can quickly overwhelm
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great deal of weight as we approach the last race of Ryder Cup units can easily grow into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderamo, where a team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but the finish line was cut by just leading the score 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We constantly remind ourselves that we had a big victory in Valderamo; we had a big victory in Bruklaine, where we lost, and also in Valderamo, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 league win in 5:3 ai National on Friday.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
We will need all the strength tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to consistently strive for it.
I’ve always said that I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know what’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I would not want to run away from myself in any way.
Tomorrow is going to be a different hair day.
Tomorrow is going to be an individual game, that’s all.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, testing your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be put in place by the players – tomorrow will have to print everything out of itself.
Now he will have to break up with his partner, and he will have to squeeze everything out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk hopes that his players will perform better individually than his partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furykas himself experienced both sides of the last day’s surprises because Bruklaine was on a happy team until Europe performed the Wood miracle and turned them into losers.”
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players to prepare for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look for a quick start – the one you saw in Bruklaine and Medina.
When the acceleration occurs in one direction, the very tense becomes the middle swords.
We formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know, are trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow.”
Thomas will be tasked with trying to take on a responsible fight and face Rory McIlroy in the top tier of the match, and Europeans will be led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonah Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I’ve chosen these men in this particular order because I think they’ll be able to successfully beat the whole game,” Bjorn said of his choice of units for the games.
The delivery of a new German military ship has been postponed again
The latest German Navy frigate had to start work back in 2014 and replace Cold War warships, however, according to local press, they will not be seen at least until next year due to ever-growing systems and extremely high prices.
According to an army spokesman quoted by Die Zeit newspaper, the surrender of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate ship, is now delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the military fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was clouded by the problems that the ship had already begun to tackle.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the military in 2007 will replace the ascending Bremen-class frigate.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful state, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and certain secrecy technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is a longer maintenance interval, which allows the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to continuous delays in the use of the most advanced technological military vessels, which are said to allow Germany to divert military power to overseas territories, will increase before they start to be used.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German press minimizes some of the major software and technical defects that would have caused the ship to have been believed in a military mission.
The lack of software is particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class will be managed by about 120 crews, which is half the size of the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is too heavy – it reduces its efficiency and limits the capabilities of the military fleet to implement various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that the 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships the Germans used in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – along with the maintenance of technical equipment, including the training of the crew – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest problems with the frigate have become extremely significant following the recent warnings that the strength of the German military fleet is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the military fleet "has indeed lacked the proper use of ships".
The official said that the problem had arisen over a period of time, as the old ships had already been written down, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the military fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
A new study, conducted in a Scottish high-rise building, aims to reveal how squid-like birds use their landscape to hunt for food.
It is expected that the findings will provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will observe squids, soprano squids, autumn ears, and watery mushrooms in the gardens of Vester Rosa Inverevo.
In certain areas of the territory will be placed special recorders, allowing to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research by hand detectors.
The analysis of all audio recordings by the experts will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by the bats and the activity of one or another type.
Then a map of the living areas and a report will be created, helping to form a detailed picture of the behavior of the whole landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Natural Resources Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat maintenance, such as the creation of meadows, as well as to find out how best to care for forested areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined.
They are threatened by the development of construction and real estate, which has an impact on the hazards and destruction of residential areas.
There is also a threat of wind turbines and lightning, as well as mussels, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as hunting house cats.
The birds aren’t really blind.
However, catching a gravy during the night hunting helps the ears more than the eyes.
The location of obstacles in the aviary or in the flight path shall be precisely determined by means of a simulated echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for looking at the swamps.
There are ten trained experts working here, who regularly conduct research, cross-checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first and only Scottish reserve specifically for bats in the Dreamave Manor in Damfrise and Galowej, home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
Housekeeper David Thompson says that the area of the mansion is ideal for them.
“We have a great place at the Threave mansion for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, so working here and elsewhere will help you better understand what they need to be able to thrive.”
He stresses that it is extremely important to check that there are no bats before the start of the territory surveillance work, because by accidental destruction of one pericardium can kill up to 400 ducks and juveniles, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Mosquitoes are protected and are prohibited from killing, irritating or interfering with them, as well as from destroying their pericles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Whistleblower Protection Foundation, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of the Whistleblowers.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know what happens to many local species."
Ronaldo Rejects Accusations of Rape: Lawyers Want to File a German Journal in Court
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations against him “melaginous” and said people, using his name, “are seeking fame.”
His lawyers have prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has expressed accusations, to be brought to court.
A Portuguese and Juventus club striker is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorg in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel said on Friday that he had allegedly paid $375,000 to the woman to stop the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a live-streamed Instagram video a few hours after reports of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "mercenaries."
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What they say today is a lie,” the Ballon d’Or winner said five times, looking at the camera.
By using my name, they want to be famous.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name is a part of my work.
I’m a happy person, everything’s fine,” the athlete added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court over allegations they have called “unacceptable suspicions about the disclosure of private space.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the athlete will seek compensation for "moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation - well, one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in the last few years."
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Nevada County Court of Appeals, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete’s room after a night club meeting in which he allegedly raped her in an anal manner.
Mayorga says after the alleged incident, Ronaldo hit the road and told her there was a “99 percent good person” who gave away “one percent” of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sex, but claimed to have been engaged.
Mayorga also said she had approached the police and her injuries were photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she was "feared by the response" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was away from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, after signing a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract, joined Italian giant Juventus.
"Brexit". The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to business secretary Greg Clark, the UK would "eternally regret" the loss of the global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about Toyota’s UK division’s statement to the BBC that, after Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at the Burnastone plant near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that if there was a no-deal Brexit at the border, the evacuation would mean the loss of jobs.
The Burnastone plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Burnastone CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about the withdrawal from the EU without an agreement and its effects on international trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant after a month of Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the threat posed to the supply chain by Brexit without a contract.
The Toyota production line operates when necessary, as the parts for the cars produced by the order are imported from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border; according to these industrial companies, it may delay the delivery of details or lack of them.
Toyota said it could not store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, so production would be halted.
According to Clark, the EU's future relationship with Theresa May's Chequers plan is "prepared precisely to avoid such checks at the border."
"We need a contract, we want to have the best contract that, as I say, will not only allow us to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also data from other car manufacturers show that the ability to continue to use a very successful supply chain system is necessary.”
Toyota could not say for what time production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallari, a 24-year-old worker at the Burnaston plant and head of the United Professional Union, said that his union members are increasingly concerned: “I’m saying from experience that if these jobs are lost, they’ll never come back.”
A government representative said: "We have proposed a clear and credible future relationship with the EU plan."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
“As the fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court judges continues, a very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller – the latter is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s aides’ ties with Russia and a possible obstruction of the president’s justice.
The question of whether Trump will pardon the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been rife for months in Washington.
The New York Times reported this month that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, in the wake of reports of resignation, he went to the White House on Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Mr Trump said he was unwilling to forgive Rosenstein, and that the meeting was later postponed to avoid a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford witnessed one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, the FTB asked the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations over the course of a week, again delaying the vote in a plenary session of the Senate.
A brief press briefing by Sarah Sanders showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "His date is not set. It may take place this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report news to the press."
Some journalists would not agree with the statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the press conferences are rarely held because he doesn’t like “effect-seeking” TV journalists. True, he added: “I have to agree with the fact that they’re effect-seeking viewers.”
At the time, he noted that Trump was more often in direct contact with the press.
“The president answers the questions more often than any previous president,” she said, adding, without providing any evidence, “We have reviewed this statistic.”
According to Sanders, a press conference will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that it has happened many times over the past few weeks. Press conferences will change your direct communication with the President of the United States."
The short constantly answers questions while leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes bizarre appearance of the president in front of journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Scotland’s health minister to EU NST workers has written about the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health of Scotland wrote a letter to NST employees from the EU expressing the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector assigned to it.
Mr Freeman wrote in a letter: "This summer the UK and EU negotiations on withdrawal have continued and are approaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has begun to prepare for a possible scenario without a deal.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
A quick operation on the head injury to Christion Abercrombie
On Saturday, during the 31:27 result, Vanderbilt Commodores team lost the race to Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie in an emergency operation, Tennesseean journalist Mike Organa reported.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just crashed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and doctors on the sideline of Abercrombie breathed oxygen, then snorted on the stretchers and sent for further research.
A Tennessee State official, Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, WSMV, said Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that “there is still no information on the type and extent of the trauma,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie, who officially spent the season in the sport, moved from Illinois to Tennessee State and played the first season.
Before leaving the game, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers who purchase UK real estate will have to pay a higher mark-up fee
Under the new track plans, foreign buyers who purchase UK real estate will have to pay a higher significant fee, and receiving additional money will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risks posed by a successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The UK tax-exempt persons will be taxed on a significant increase in taxes
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way, and allocate them to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers who purchase UK real estate are going to be taxed at a higher rate, and have received additional money to help the homeless.
When it comes to securing more affordable housing and applying to high-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risks posed by the successful campaign of Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters.
A significant increase in tax will be charged to UK tax-free individuals and businesses, and to receive additional money is allocated to the Government’s anti-ban campaign.
The additional charge – paid next to the current stamp duty, including for those who bought a second home or rented a house at higher rates two years ago – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this move will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is purchased by non-UK residents. As a result, prices are rising and first-time home buyers are finding it more difficult to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad, so many wealthy countries and especially the capital’s districts have become ghost towns.
The new strategy was introduced just a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but without using it, they supported the high prices of real estate, and urged May to settle the shame of the UK's supply house by relinquishing the purchased home quotas.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the ban on discharge without fault.
In addition, he wants more power to build new homes to provide municipal councils.
May said: “I said last year that as prime minister, I will try to bring back the British dream – for every new generation, life has to be better.
This means that we need to deal with our troubled housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not fair that non-residents in the UK and foreign-based businesses can buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For most people, the dream of having a home has become almost unfulfilled, and the threat of humiliation is still too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish election’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever become head of the Scottish electorate.
The 42-year-old likes the challenge to revive the North-East club, currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-place club.
When St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B-team and it was all over," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish election competitions, and that always attracted me to come back.
It is true that this event will only take place if I manage the club successfully."
Until Rosso "Sunderland" was led by Dicks Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn’t feel anxious to start working under such well-known managers at such a large club.
“Now my success will be assessed based on the answer to the question ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and conditions, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him out, but I think I've been working here successfully."
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years. Before that, he worked as a manager's assistant at Dumbarton Club and for 15 months replaced Hearts coach.
It later helped to recover to the third division's Alloa, and St Mirren's club, which threatened to fall, turned the next season into champions.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls of the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better for me to lead than to play.
It sounds strange, because it followed me, I made a lot of money and the most satisfying wins.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. Growing up I always felt in my own shoes, but leadership gives the greatest satisfaction."

The study found that the best time to drink beer was at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of poor British fishermen, but made it even more difficult for restaurant networks to cope with the burden.
The figures revealed that sales of groups of beer and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenue in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
CGA, a business consulting firm based on the data, said: “England’s participation in the World Cup has continued to grow at a similar rate as in June, when the number of alums rose by 2,8 percent.
In June, restaurant sales fell by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became even worse.
The main revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages and bars was undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew stronger than it did in restaurants.
Although not as strong as the restaurant companies, the sunflower also suffered the main income from the food trade.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in well-stocked restaurants and bars rose 6.6 per cent this month and food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and leisure sector analyst at RSM, says: “These results continue the visible trend from the end of April.
When it comes to food institutions, the main factors continue to be the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
So it’s no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer. True, a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent in just one year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the growing pressure associated with costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for businesses that are earning the most income from trading food. Time will show whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the necessary respite."
The overall growth in sales in aludas and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected a slowdown in the development of networks belonging to brands.

One in five children have hidden social media accounts from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have social media accounts that are hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing.
The news reinforces the fear that sexual content will be advertised
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a basic account.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create a secret social media account and hide it from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that there is a rapid increase in fake Insta pages – a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news reinforces the fear that sexual content will be advertised
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored primary account to show their parents, but they also have a secret account.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her three-year-old daughter, found out that the teenager offered emphatically: “Run me out.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>18-year-olds have two accounts, and half of such students admit to having accounts hidden.
Mike Buchanan, MDK’s head, said: “The fact that so many teenagers give up on the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is alarming.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
At the annual meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its director.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and president. Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity, which allows people in charge of sports to take advantage of the diverse experience she has gained over the past decade at an international level.
“Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish Sports Council will be of great benefit,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope that I will really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The 200- and 400-meter-long game at the 1996 Atlanta Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals won by the American, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after an experienced short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
I had to work until the chase, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast-milk advertising, in which mothers are compared to cows, received different reviews online
The company that manufactures breast milk has received different opinions about its advertising, in which feeding mothers are compared to milk cows.
In order to mark the product, described as the world’s first silent portable breast lift, the beginning of a commercial, Elvie has released an inspired advertisement of an ironic music video. It is aimed at demonstrating the freedom to eat.
In the full carve of Siena, four real mothers dance to the sound of a recording, where they hear, for example, the words: “Yes, I beg to see myself, but I see no tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, here are not the facts, here are my breasts.”
“Take him out, take him out, feed him the babies, take him out, take him out, take my beautiful ones.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The video, viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, was reacted differently by the audience, many of whom said that it is seen through the fingers of the dairy industry.
“Advertising cows for this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, only after their newborn babies are removed from them after a few days,” one woman wrote.
Elvie Breast Milk Unnoticeable Space in the Feeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is clear that this is traumatizing both the mother and the newborn.
But why not take advantage of the advertisements that deliver breast milk to mothers whose babies are not taken away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a total misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the advertisement – one woman admitted that her song turned out to be “very funny”.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I still ate it.
When I cut out the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as who it is.
This product is brilliant,” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun ad is for moms who quit milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or to punish the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that everyone was dancing with unobtrusive milkshakes fitted in the bras.
The campaign’s idea is based on the insight that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s milk does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes, and has an unobtrusively space in the feeding trough – so women can move freely, keep babies or even leave the house by cutting off milk.
Mother’s partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie’s milk is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the cessation of milk and all its challenges, while at the same time having fun and as much as possible showing an incredible sense of freedom, which will be given by the new dairy.
Elvie's milkshake in the press headlines did not hit the headlines for the first time.
During London Fashion Week, designer Martha Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mother demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to tent camp near the Texas border.
The number of people crossing the border over the course of a month has not changed substantially, but the number of children detained by migrants has increased significantly – partly because of the tight rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to accommodate them with caregivers.
Traditionally, the majority of caregivers themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid that applying for child care risked the possibility of staying in the country.
In June, the federal government announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk further increased.
Last week, immigration and customs chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had appealed for the care of adults who were underage.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not previously been tried.
“Nearly 80 percent of these people – guardians or members of their families – live in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
According to shelter workers, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children in court must appear within a month of detention, and not within 60 days, as was usual earlier.
Many people will try to defend their legal status against a judge on immigration issues, not by coming in person, but by using a conference video call.
Those who do not have the right to receive assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the reports received by the shelter staff and in recent months from the system, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say that this raises even more concern in large institutions, such as the Tornillo shelter: the size of them increases the likelihood of not noticing signs that the child is combing.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria has ordered the U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In addition, by appealing to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces in Syria, which have the pretext of fighting terrorism, are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said Damascus would not be allowed to fight this sacred struggle until all Syrian territories were destroyed by terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in the country.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria who mostly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are good. At the same time, some Western countries accused them of spreading unfounded fears that deter refugees from returning.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them come back,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive aid for the reconstruction when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey allowed to avoid a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces aimed at the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provides for clear deadlines, and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front, which is linked to Al Qaeda, which will be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a committee of government and opposition members to prepare a draft of the post-Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee – the group’s work must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why would Trump be elected for a second term?
According to such logic, Trump would be elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers would probably expect, his presidency would have previously been blamed and scandalous.
That would have been the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
So far, the audience has not seen any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time ratings on CNN TV have grown more than twice <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> to 1.05 million, and MSNBC – almost three times <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcast time, which has grown from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable TV ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” said Neal Baer, a producer on ABC’s “Descendant” series about the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after the attack that broke out in the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Just Fun Facts and a Few Unpleasant Truths about Secretly Getting to the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'He's making fun of me,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is worth the distraction.
Of course, unlike the other shows shown on television, strippers from Washington can decide the case of Roe against Wade’s future, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the global economy.
Non-observation is a luxury that can only be allowed by the most privileged spectators.
And yet this is more than what it takes to be an informed citizen when they realize that Washington has been watching for six hours and a group of experts are discussing how Bob Woodward is using unscathed data in his book Fear, and Paul Manafort is demonstrating a US$15,000 “strike” with a sharp-edged sword.
I’ll never watch Super Mario again, either.
“His actions are reminiscent of a reality show, because every night he kills you with something,” says Enhementhouse General Jung-unini, director of “Wheelhouse General” and director of “The Changing Actors of Trump’s Show” and “Daily Window of Tears (Intense into Conflict with N.F.L. or Gentleman Kim Jong-un).”
You can't miss a series, otherwise you'll miss it.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of warmth and sunshine outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was tuning inside and watching MSNBC while recording.
He was unable to unravel – certainly not when Brett Kavanaughui had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
“I remember when we used to create those crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleissas said.
“I thought there was some kind of joke here, but it turns out they were right.”

The tight midterm elections in the House of Representatives are being fought with money from the environment
It’s no wonder that because of the congressional district redeployment, which ended in two House of Representatives attempts to win the same post, Pennsylvania’s 17th District was cashed out.
The recently re-elected Pittsburgh district has included a Democrat in the House of Representatives, Conor Lamba, who won his seat last spring in a special election in another district.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th district. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was overturned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old county had been falsified in violation of the constitution for the benefit of Republicans.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRKK) – collapsed due to the campaign’s finances.
In Pennsylvania, the Lamb was famous for winning a small vote in the 18th congressional district, which won a wide-viewed special election in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans have taken the place, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the region.
Political scientists have given the Democrats such an advantage.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, But After Shutdown
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have largely failed to get a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm-up meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the Trump Organization leadership was ousted.
“Due to the recent decisions taken by the Taiwanese Department of State, officials have decided to revoke heads of American diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” the department’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions are being considered only for Salvador, who in 2017 received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific persons, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and homicide.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. It was due to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward to prevent the passage to the United States during the migration.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear to those who wanted the conference to take place, and so essentially ended any discussions about the sanctions on Salvador.
“In order to show the importance of the administration to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now included in the list of speakers of the conference scheduled for mid-October,” the diplomats said.
Three U.S. envoys have returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any U.S. violations or punishments.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion, which was told by three American officials, including two diplomats. They agreed to discuss the internal discussions only in the event that their anonymity would be preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity will be preserved.
Learn the history
Further, it is inevitable to expect a report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible impedance of Trump to justice – his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as mentioned, Mueller is calling his investigation into whether the Trump campaign has not been carried out secretly in cooperation with Russia that has damaged our elections.
If Congress were to take over, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he prepares to stand again against the voters, and perhaps finally against the governing committee.
There are a lot of “ifs” here and I do not say that the end of Trump is inevitable – as is his correspondence in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to choose, and these choices will determine whether the fight will go on for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take down Hitler, who had to have the West oppose him and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We had fun and missed the opportunity to prevent the road to the slaughterhouses that lasted several years later.
History revolves around such essential turning points – then the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such essential turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller’s investigation is based?
Rosenstein’s hesitation began when the newspaper reported that last year the official had secretly offered to record the president and had considered his inadequacy to go along with these duties.
Rosenstein says the story of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FTB investigation by Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite convincing allegations of sexual violence and false evidence, this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lessons I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew. She was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once located in a house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years sent me to light candles on the table with candles.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look to our future in a non-optimistic way?

Graham Dorrans from 'Rangers' Reunion with 'Rapid Vienna' Expects Optimism
On Thursday, Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna, knowing that if the impressive competition with Villarreal against the East in Spain earlier this month were to win, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave Group G.
As a result of the road injury midfield player Graham Dorrans was able to appear for the first time this season only in the 2:2 result in the finals with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers club can use this result as a stepping stone towards more important goals.
“We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started playing with the hope that we would achieve something, and we ended up achieving it.
Maybe we could have been quieter in the end, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first round, and we got into the second and we showed who we are a better team.
There will be another important European League night on Thursday.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult, because in recent competitions their result was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can push forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was really tough – and that’s what happened with my injuries, and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that now we will be able to push forward, forget about last season and play successfully."
A woman’s fear of pensions is clouding her life
While the survey participants clearly imagined what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they talked to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with the kids.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they’re not trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not inform your wishes in advance, families will not be prepared to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Contact your financial advisor. An advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for these costs.
You can choose to pay for long-term care by using a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mix of money<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>value life insurance certificate, or by insuring your property as long as you have the money.
Select legal documents. Protect documents that allow you to prevent legal disputes from occurring.
Choose an authority for health care. Choose a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists will meet your needs if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the authority to care for your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become inefficient.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical care and is taking him or her to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be ready, write down these details in the plan.
“Not only financial matters are important. Who are the doctors?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> asked Martin.

Ilfrakum air rifle man shot down several times
After spending the evening in the city, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
He was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm of a 40-year-old man in the County of Oxford, Devon.
At about 2:30 a.m. in the summertime in England, officers described the shooting as a random act.
The victim was not seen.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police are asking for the help of witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
“At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials say. The death toll is expected to continue to rise.
Because of the destroyed communications assistance services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal regent, an area north of Palu, near the epicenter of a 7.5-point earthquake.
After the accident, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, about 379,800 inhabitants of Palu are the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake struck and hit with lightning, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that has reached more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, there were about 299,200 inhabitants in the regency – outside the province in the smallest administrative region.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongalos.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, the truth is mainly concentrated on the other side of the Sulawesi coast in Moravia.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past century.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed by the tsunami in the Dongal.
In addition, in 1996 he hit the western Dongal with a knife and killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is located on a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is constantly threatened by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a powerful earthquake in Indonesia's western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast - more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March 2005 and the beginning of April, several strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southernmost part of Indonesia's densely populated Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the area near the western capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a 7.5-point quake struck one of Sumatra's islands and caused a tsunami with waves reaching up to 10 meters, which wiped out dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, due to the severe earthquake in Aceh, the Pidija Jaya Regency was destroyed and panicked as people remembered how everything was wiped out after the terrible 2004 quake and tsunami.
This autumn, the tsunami did not occur, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist-rich island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Sarah Palin's son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A police report released on Saturday said Palin, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting on domestic violence, and resistance to arrest, according to the Associated Press.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palin was returned to a pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and released for a $500 bail.
“On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he was asked to stand trial, claiming he was completely innocent,” the network said.
Palin is accused of three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
The incident is linked to the January 2016 allegations of assault at home, the obstruction of reporting on the crime of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while incapacitated.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when cruel behavior of her son was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people were killed after a tsunami struck Indonesia's Sulawesi Island on Friday.
A 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes in the area.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social media, videos are shared, in which you can see the moment of a tsunami strike.
Cunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Pau.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty for Suspected New York Terrorist Attack <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that hasn’t been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, the thirty-year-old Saipov from the Home Depot rented a truck and staged an attack on a bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – riding a track, laying down pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in the southern New York City area of intent to seek the death penalty, prosecutors justifying the death penalty will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these defendants may serve a death sentence.
After the attack a few weeks later, the federal grand jury of sworn-in judges released a 22-point indictment to Saipov, which included eight counts of murder in connection with the rape of property (usually the federal prosecutors’ motoring and traffic crimes).
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and thought out in advance, which is how Saipov described it as a slap, cruel and immoral.
"As a result of Sayfullo Habibullaeviciaus Saipov's actions, the following family members and friends were injured, and their loved ones were killed: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1> and Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xB3> Ferru<0xC3><0xB3>n<0xC3><0xB3>.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The final case, which required the death penalty, was examined in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in 1953 in the New York federal case was for spouses Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when they were convicted two years ago of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not suffer from his actions either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he had watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
Police said he had also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital building.
He did not admit his guilt under 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal-funded defenders of the state, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than to acknowledge the guilt and be sentenced to life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori's MP says that NIGEL FARAGE'S negotiations must be held accountable for Brexit
Today, during the Tories conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
A former UKIP leader said politicians must feel Eurosceptic heat, and one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would now have stepped down if Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the broken-up coalition of supporters have been revealed by the remaining towers in the EU, which have joined the city’s separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed upon in his Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies strongly demanded that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostile reactions and force the Eurosceptic and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone during the Leave Means Leave meeting, Solihale said he wanted to destroy the Chequers plan.
He said Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU," he said.
Velingboro MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we did not fight to obey others.
We want to pass our laws in our country.”
Bone has denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue.”
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyn also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Czechoslovak's plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a critical message, May added: “The prime ministers keep their posts when I keep the promises they made.”
Farage said mitigating politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a referendum decision in 2016.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, our people and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to give Brexit away, so we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them get away with it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to force our political class, which almost gave up Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing this nation’s army, which brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the UK.”
And the opponents of Brexit, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre, walked the streets of Birmingham.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists were doing “Tories Before Brexit” posters.
Labourman Lord Adonis sneered at the Conservatives over the security problems they experienced over the party's programme at the start of the conference.
“It’s people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the Canada plus plus option, for the walls without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about her future at a meeting with the society in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is constantly critical of President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November re-election, which will meet with GOP state representative Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it could face Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke has been its 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington and fix the government that is in power, and that it must be led by women.
Suspect in LSU Sims shooting case
Louisiana-based Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect who was accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dytheon Simpson, 20, had been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked to help identify the man they saw.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the University of South University early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday that Wayde's Sims had been shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde's stood up to defend a friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun and a show to Wayde' Sims.
Simpson was held unopposed and was locked in an East Baton Rouge police station.
The 198-cm-long pre-race student Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in five, averaged 17.4 minutes on the pitch, earned 5.6 points, and rebounded 2.9 points.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title as team orders him to award victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteris Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying race on Saturday, he immediately made it clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions in the race will be extremely important.
Starting from the first place, Bottas made a great start and, in defending his position in the first two turns, barely left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first turned into a two-door garage, left Hamilton and he returned to racing in the group's tail, so it was decided.
Mercedes turned into a two-door garage behind the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after barely finishing the action, burst forward when the Ferrari driver, after a double maneuver, managed to keep the track in the third position.
The 21st birthday celebration of Max Verstappen began from the end of the revolution, but by the end of the first round the seventh had already passed.
It was the fastest part of the race because it went without changing the tyres to be as fast as possible in the finish, enveloping Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
At the end of the 44 lap, he entered the garage with two openings, but in the remaining eight laps he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen cut the finish line by a quarter.
"Valtteri had a hard day because he had a great weekend, and when I was asked to leave, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team has done a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump at a meeting with the people on Saturday has sworn in to Senator Dianne Feinstein over the persistent denial of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which a Supreme Court justice candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is accused of sexual assault.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name the demonstrations Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wrong, wrong, and wrong.
"What may have happened and is actually happening in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people being angry, unkind, rude, and wrong," he said.
“When you see official statements and omissions, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you drowned?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did you miss the document? “Oh, oh, what?
No, I'm not.
I'm not running away."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we run ... no, we didn’t run,” he added, portraying the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaughui and which had been fired earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been fired from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations and I did not miss out on her story.”
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked."
But, apparently, the president did not agree with her negativity. He said during a meeting with people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't drown, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to challenge a candidate for the Supreme Court justices, who were accused of sexually abusing three women, the president said the Democrats had used the charges for their own benefit.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see indifference, indifference; they don’t care what they’re hurting or what they have to go through in order to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer wins two sets in games with Dandi club Giants
Dundee Stars backed down for Friday's Elite League defeat at the Belfast Giants and won Saturday's match-fixing match against Dandi 5:3.
The Giants made an early comeback when two picks were won by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauwillier over the years.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had a balanced result, before Dwyer took the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of Dand<0xC3><0xAD>'s team equalised the result, but later secured two victories for Lucas Lundwald Nielsen.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third defeat this season in the Elite League, before losing to Belfast on Friday night and defeating Dandi in a 2–1 draw.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with three previous matches winning the Giants.
Dwyer took the first innings in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaullo's transfer, and after four more minutes, Beauwillier doubled the lead after David Rutherford's transfer.
Sullivan returned the arena's hosts to the game in a 13:10 win, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer to Cownie's, he equalised the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take the first break in the lead, and at the end of the first quarter he won his second night's over.
With a quantitative review, the owners of the square regrouped and Bouchard again equalised the result 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's combined forces to help Nielsen for the first time in the games to push the Dandi team forward at the end of the second quarter, and cemented the victory by winning the fifth team victory in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have already lost the last four games out of five, will meet Milton Keynes's team at home next Friday.
The flight commander was killed to help hundreds of passengers on the plane escape from an earthquake.
The head of Indonesia's flight was declared a hero when he died helping the plane with several hundred passengers safely take to the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are believed to be missing after Friday’s severe earthquake that devastated the island of Sulawesi caused a tsunami.
The site was continued by strong repeated underground strikes and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily swinging control tower at the city’s Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed at his place of work to help the 6,321-flying Batik Air plane, which was already on the runway, safely take off.
Then thinking that the tower of flight control is collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, Indonesia's air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We shoved him with a baton from Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, the helicopter had not yet reached Palu.
“This is a sad news to us,” he added.
And the government fears that the death toll could rise to thousands, as the country’s disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangal, Sigismund and Bouton are hard to reach.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise because many of the victims are still behind the rubble and we cannot reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s representative.
Up to a height of six meters the waves have destroyed the city of Pau; a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Fast cars bring the victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed all over the place."
Janis Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesia’s President Jokos Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims that one person has been missing when the plane crashed into a lagoon
The flight, which ended the plane’s crash in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, now says one person has been missing, although earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon she had no knowledge of a single passenger.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests to provide more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane, while attempting to land at Chuk Island Airport, crashed into the water.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses of the incident believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low altitude.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to escape to the emergency exits on a plane that was rigged and loaded up to the runway.
He said that the flight attendants were covered in panic and shouting, and he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that by repairing the docks nearby, their sailors also helped rescue people who were allegedly transported by boat to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the aviation safety network, 111 people were killed in the plane crashes on Papua New Guinea’s air lines over the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analysts put out a sequence of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office released the facts on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to bring together the death of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chamber the night of her death, which is contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he had not been in his city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth by saying that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "laughing because his trucks were in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and addressee information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
It is expected that the defense will begin to lay out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the defendants later that same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading positive messages to their music.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the sources of the hip-hop and once again popularize the conscious hip-hop.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have recently resurfaced in the UK in works by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black one?
New York grandchild gives a couple in court after being fired for "racist" message
A New York grandchild filed a lawsuit for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a message from her mother that she was “another black woman” sent to the wrong address.
The couple denied the allegations and called the lawsuit an “abuse.”
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman’s niece learned that the new babysitter Giselle Maurice is black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEE, BUT ONE JUDGMENT,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was sent twice not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing that Plasco-Flaxman had committed an irreconcilable act, she felt uncomfortable and fired from her job, saying that a former foster mother, who was an African-American, had done her job poorly and had hoped to get a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for one day and she was sent home by Uber car.
Maurice has now filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for his dismissal and seeks to pay even $350 a day for a half-year’s life and work in the client’s home, to which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things cannot be done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
A couple broke out on charges of racism by denying it and said that releasing Maurice from work was wise because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists," the husband, Joel Plascas, told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you didn’t respect, even if it was a mistake?
His new birth?
Nemanau."
Plascas, who has been accused of “abuse,” said his wife had received the baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to trial for this?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added the investment banking specialist.
While the court case is being examined, the media has narrowed down a couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers won’t understand the talking mascot
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel in another place, reading the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it is very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a pulmonary bladder, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was dead.
Speaking about Padington, whom she describes as a “very important member of the family,” she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty calm person and he didn’t like to drink,” she said.
“Because Padington was so similar to himself, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he had a similar appreciation for Paddington’s success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of imagination, he always gave Paddington his own merit.
My daughter was immortal and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the fall, her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Nicos Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors failed to save her life.
“Nada constantly called and said that the situation was really bad, she was not expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nada, who called to say she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said good-bye.
I said to her, “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given by doctors, which supported her heart rate, slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a little while ago and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now regretting his dead daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, not realizing what a difficult test she needs to overcome.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was cut off and tears were burning all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women’s Openness to Prevent Suicides on Bridges
Two women, who have lost their loved ones, try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge are distributing postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help with.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he fell ill with depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a single parent to feel the way I should feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old, who lives in the airport, said her son was a very promising boss with a squeaky smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lights up the room.”
However, he threw the job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his murdered brother.
Davis said: “I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur.”
Dr. Davis said: “People need to know that there are people around who can talk and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mr. Davies, has lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changing attitude.
The situation was completely bad at Christmas: when the children wrapped up their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye and didn’t react in any way.”
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family it left emptiness.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

After the start of the FTB study, Bretto Kavanaugh’s future hung on his hair
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a limited-term and full-scale study – maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “by” in the tough sidebars.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, there are only five weeks left and, if Republicans are expected to turn out to be poor, their efforts to elect the person to the country's highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bushui in the White House and met through him with his wife Ashley, Bush's former personal secretary.
What will happen when FTB submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether the Kavanaugh Senate can get 50 votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and approve him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of deserters “decreased” after coming to power in Kimi
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean desserts to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserters in 2011.
Park said the main factors had been tightening control of the North Korean and Chinese border and rising prices of human smuggling.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many of the North Korean desserts are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return to their homelands.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for negotiations that have been stalled at the centre of negotiations over the abandonment of nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two essentially agreed to aim for the Korean peninsula to become a nuclear-free zone.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since then.
“If there is no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally challenge it in any way,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi dismisses Brett Kavanaugh as "sterile" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "sterile" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks in an interview he gave at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I just can’t believe that if a woman did that, she would be said to be a woman,” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were still teenagers.
During his initial speech, when he spoke about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unconvinced or busy.
He also condemned former Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations “a grotesque and co-ordinated destruction of reputation” that was not organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his bias toward the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if Kavanaugh would be removed if his candidacy were approved and Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“I will say this – if he is lying to Congress or the FTB, it is not appropriate to go to office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Pelosi added that she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions as a Democrat on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the approval hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"Now is not the time for us to say, hysterically, to be a judge of a foreign person, 'How wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
The power that women should use.
This is a legitimate criticism – a contusion that has finally spread for months and even a year, which it cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Mr. Stein said 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem unusual to me, does it?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by one woman, the head of a company, who told me that she was also crying when she got upset, but she developed a certain method: when she got upset and started crying, she said to the person with whom you were talking at the time, ‘You probably don’t seem to be crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
It looked like a genius to me.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger partly because of the fact that they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, where the men worked the most and where I once started to cry for an unspoken hug. Then an older woman, a distraught boss, who I always kind of squealed a little, and squealed into the field.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
They don’t know you’re busy.
It seems to them that you are sad, so you will be glad to have overcome you.”
Democratic congressman Patricia Schroeder from Colorado worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on board the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, the deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he joked after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates at the time, so I really didn’t need another one.
Someone called me "Snowflakes with Seven Dwarfs."
After the campaign began late, there was little time left to raise money, so she vowed not to announce the candidacy until she received $2 million.
It was an unfair fight.
She noticed that some of the supporters, who sacrificed $1,000 for men, only gave her $250.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
Speaking the language in which he announced that he was launching a formal campaign, it was so full of emotions – gratitude for people who supported him, a system of disappointment that it was extremely difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger over sexism.
“You’d think I’m nervous,” Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought that I was supported by the Cleenex server business.
I remember thinking what would be recorded in my tomb monument.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S. and China trade generation could benefit Beijing
The first U.S.-China trade war was raging, and although the battle is still far from over, experts say dissatisfaction can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year as early as possible of charging for major Chinese-exported products, including solar elements, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest confrontation took place this week, when new tariffs on goods valued at $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) came into effect, i.e. half of Chinese goods exported to the United States will be taxed.
Beijing responded to all the measures at the same time, with the latest decision imposing a duty of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods totaling $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. tooth for the tooth, and it seems that this second-largest market in the world is definitely not going down in the near future.
Washington’s sanctions would only ease if China complied with the demands, but the US’s public slump would be too wired to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly beats its party, the trade war with the US could have a long-term positive impact on China, as it would reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for both countries’ economies is actually much more dangerous than observers have so far acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia New America Security Center.
According to Syria’s foreign minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria says it is preparing for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a war-torn country that has endured more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“As a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the territory has become much more stable and secure,” he said.
The government continues to seek to restore the terrorist-affected areas and restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been laid for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been left behind for the sake of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions aimed at daily life and well-being.
According to UN estimates, about 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team, who cut the U.S. team to 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in this continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team collected 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, launched a strike from the starting field directly into the water against Francesco Molinari on the 3rd day of the 16th.
Italian player F. Molinari rose to fame in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament acquired its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was defeated by the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top scorer, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the most successful European player of all time, scoring 25.5 career points in the tournament.
“I rarely cry, but today I can’t control myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the trophy back.
It all depends on the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” said emotion-packed Garcia after the European victory.
He relays a relay to his native John Ram, who in Sunday's 2:1 game, knocked down the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said at the age of 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
This is an odd statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won the 14 biggest prizes and dropped only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to make it to the racetrack all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these men, they’re fighting.
There was a time when we were going to press the Europeans.
We're on the move.
I'll take a hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to bow your head.
“Our opponents were more prophetic.”
The news of the Red Flood. The concentration in Painelas, Manatee and Sarasota is decreasing
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) states that the total concentration of the "red tide" in the Tampa Bay Aquarium is decreasing.
According to the FWC, more fragmented blooms have been observed in the counties of Painelas, Manatis, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kollieri – this makes it possible to assume that the concentration decreases.
The “Red Flood” blooms around 130 miles of coastline from northern Painelas to southern Li counties.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles from the coast in the Hilsboro area, but they are less than last week.
The “red tide” was also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week it was reported that the concentration in the province of Painelas and along its coast – average, along the coast of Hilsboro – from the bottom to the top, in the province of Manatis – from the bottom to the top, in the province of Sarasota and along the coast – from the bottom to the bottom, in the province of Aar
