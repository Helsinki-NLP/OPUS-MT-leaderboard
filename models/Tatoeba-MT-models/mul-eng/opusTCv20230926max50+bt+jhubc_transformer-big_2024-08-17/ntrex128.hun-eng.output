Members of the Walesi National Assembly are concerned that they will find themselves at the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly agreed to the proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, representative of the Welsh Parliament).
The suffrage came after it emerged that the name of the National Assembly would rather be the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives from different political backgrounds believe that the new title can make them the object of laughter.
According to one Labour MP, his faction is worried that their new name will rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for the benefit of our Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, twp means community and pwp means kaka.
According to one Plaid party representative, the entire faction is "unsatisfied" and therefore propose alternatives.
One of the conservatives said his faction was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP was just a leap away from "Muppet".
It is worth noting here that in Welsh the letter "w" is omitted in the same way as in Yorkshire English the letter "u", i.e. MWP is pronounced "map".
The Committee of the National Assembly responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the name change is as follows: ‘The final decision, of course, is in the hands of the representatives with regard to the names of the members of the National Assembly.’
The 2017 law regulating the government of Wales made it possible to change the name of the Welsh National Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Welsh Parliament, and which received broad support.
With regard to the address of the representatives, the Commission prefers the address of the Welsh Member of Parliament (representative of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation favoured the MWP alternative.
There are new and new alternatives for the representatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The Law on Reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including on the disqualification of representatives and on the Commission structures.
In the matter of their own address, the representatives will be able to dismiss the final vouchers during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, citizens will vote on whether to change the country’s name to “North Macedonia’s Republic”.
The aim of the referendum is to mark the end of a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that it is essentially based on territorial demand in the name of its northern neighbour, and has repeatedly rejected its request for admission by the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia himself opposes the referendum on the name change, and thus does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise that must be made for their EU and NATO membership.
The Harlem churches are in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin are also silenced
“Rather, as I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“He’s not one of them now.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People are now in a different society,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the social life where people end up every day.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and over time they will be kept in the same place where they left off.”
In place of the churches, he says, residential buildings will be spared, the community of which also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of buyers of apartments in these buildings will be white-skinned,” he says, “and this further hastens the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem had grown into a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirties,
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for his boycotted leadership of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street to use blacks or sell black products against his unwilling business owners.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell tower was built to order a community led by the Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor on St. Martin's Square, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
In July, according to the bell-playing expert, this bell-playing game is "a cultural heritage", "an irreplaceable, historically significant instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world’s first bell to ring by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who set out 18 years ago to play a larger bell at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin did not hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin, a complex situation has arisen in recent months with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, partly led by the secular leadership of the church, partly by the bishop’s office.
In July, the parish’s governing body, the Council of the Ecclesiastical Community, addressed the Bishop’s Office in writing, saying that the Office would “transfer the costs” to the Council, provided that the Council did not participate in the constructions contracted by the Office.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency throughout the office’s home.
Capa attacked a 13-year-old California boy during a carnage
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during a cancer attack on the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred at 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV on Saturday morning that he and his friends had been snoring for half an hour when he noticed that a boy was screaming for help, and that he was taking more to help him get out of the water.
Hammel first thought the boy was just excited because he was able to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “He’s caught!
It's coming!"
“He had a broken shoulder at the key bone,” Hammel said, pointing to what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started screaming for everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a hole in the water,’” he added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks had been spotted in the area, but it was then determined that it belonged to non-human species.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries on his upper body.
During the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's to expand into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert salespeople and wholesale-style pipers with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of the decline in sales of fashion and household items, as part of the ongoing strengthening of the UK beauty care market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, the chain has been successfully tested in 11 stores across the country since the beginning of the year.
The increase in the pipeline is due to the fact that the shops are trying to fill up the shelf areas occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in the past in various ways.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its offering to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it now offers for the first time.
But the earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area, according to brands such as Boots and similar stores expect customers.
The retail chain is also relaunching the Boutique Makeup Family, in which the majority of products are now vegan – these are being sought by more and more young customers nowadays.
Fragrance Shop’s perfume distributor is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury’s stores, one of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online shopping, as well as the food-buying habits, by redirecting to small local trades, large-scale businesses need to make greater efforts to make customers appreciate.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says the offer will be more and more similar to the mix-up, as the retail chain is trying to compete with more and more services and other products besides food, such as retail stores and retail stores.
Since buying up the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos classes in its stores, as well as some Habitat classes – this step has had a positive impact on food deliveries, so it’s also refreshing.
The previous attempt by the department store chain on the slump of beauty care and drug classes proved to be a failure.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended a heated dispute over the distribution of the proceeds of the drug classes operating in its stores.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its drug business in its 281 stores for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to the company Celesionas, which runs the Lloyds walking chain.
According to the retail chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skincare products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “By transforming the look of our pipe stands, we want to create a more enjoyable environment for our customers.
In addition, we have trained staff who will help with advice for those who are interested.
Our brand offering caters to all your needs, while the attractive environment and convenient location provide a compelling force that will take your shopping experience to a new level.”
Peter Jones 'broken' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, has left “bullying” after television host Holly Willoughby stepped down from an 11-million-dollar deal to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand, which sells homewear and accessories.
The company's two celebrities were previously compared to the Goop brand, which was listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old show host, announced on Instagram that she would be leaving.
Holly Willoughby has thoroughly pulled the plug on the Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when she emerged from their promising, lifestyle-selling company at the last minute – to become a special focus of her own with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was "disappeared" when his welcome address to television on Tuesday, at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced during a tense meeting that he had not been able to get away with his new contracts worth a total of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, and that he had not had enough time to get away with it.
The two celebrities’ business was previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of her vacationers.
A source said: “True was the most important thing for Holly.
It was that he would deal with this in the long run, and it will give his livelihood over the next few decades.
The fact that he came out was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because the start was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to experts, the departure of this morning’s host, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars from pillows and candles to a selection of body parts to clothing and home wear.
And it can also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-year-old actress and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years ago.
Willoughby Capp launched Truly back in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product line-up and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said: “We don’t want to announce anything about [Jones’ business].”
Hard words were spoken, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about what kind of criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some may consider “unprecedented” and why he made such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?”
– asked Trump in a funny “heroes” tone.
“I didn’t let it go.”
As he noted, Kim would also like to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first, in June, talks in Singapore as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stifling.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees it, there is no "appropriate response" to North Korea's early arms attacks by the United States.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to maintain sanctions aimed at putting pressure on the country.
In a campaign speech, Trump said he was much more optimistic about it.
“Things are going very well with North Korea,” he said.
It was like we were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost there.
But now the relationship between us is very good.”
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have put positive results into perspective – the completion of the rocket launchers, the release of hostages, and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained the extent to which he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s not hard to be president, but now there’s not a 10,000 people out there trying to get in and they’re just standing right in front of me two hundred,” Trump said, pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of deaths from tsunamis and earthquakes that rock the island.
Indonesia has also refused the assistance of international aid organisations following the earthquake in Lombok.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be resettled, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, it has been made very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” said Sumbang.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a rescue team that can be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Agency, said Indonesian authorities are currently conducting an assessment of the situation in Pula to see if it is necessary to involve international aid agencies.
Despite the fact that earthquakes are continuing in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared for the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, in other coastal areas this is not uncommon at all.
In the case of the same tsunami warning, the apparent lack of the tsunami warning siren system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster that would require human lives.
Transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best times.
At the time of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before reaching the disaster-stricken area.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia’s infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and has not spared the costs of road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president must also face the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have begun to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced by riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets with bulldozers, bows and arrows, as well as other armoured weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a huge equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in the 89th minute of the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, so they did not lose to Chelsea.
The team lost 0<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1 when Sturridge was knocked out of Chelsea's gate by Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres.
First he threw the ball to the left, then he started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high above the eleven and the net went to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net above the seeding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get into position because there’s always someone like Shaq who’s going to advance the ball, so I tried to get myself in the best position possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, and I just took him away, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led to a 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>0 lead in the half-time after winning the lead in the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball to the Blues in a corner, then managed to break the ball in the middle of the field and throw it to Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> started after a quick start and got the ball back in the middle.
Then, with a beautiful handover, he launched Hazard towards the eleventh.
Hazard ran off the defense and finally sent the ball into the far corner at the Liverpool gate with Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo Arena in Naples, as the next stop of the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London at UEFA Europa League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami.
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster protection agency said on Sunday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and a six-metre-high wave of flooding in the wake of the quake also buried several people under the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press release.
The streets of the more than 380 thousand Palu are covered by ruins of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of a wounded woman
Police launched an investigation into the murder case after a woman's body was found dead this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman’s body was found in Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m. on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking residents in the area to report to anyone who has seen or died.
Superintendent Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but this time I would like to ask anyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and might have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to find us as well, because they may have important information from the point of view of the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, the woman's friends came to the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is under way, and the police are currently notifying the victim's family members.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police were informed that no one could enter the building and no one could leave.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman grinned with her tears.
“It’s terrible,” he repeated.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police microbuses stopped inside the cordon and another one outside.
Inside the cordon, several police officers also observed the house tomb.
If you have any information, write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 without a name, and refer to the September 30, 247 file.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fire
The statue's falsification may have been a poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical puritanical followers at the time destroyed England's cultural and ecclesial heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick’s proposal is “a folly,” an “attempt to rewrite history.”
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell Statue would eventually become a target for the current debate on the removal of statues.
During the English Civil War, the demolition was not ordered by Cromwell and carried out.
So maybe another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his ascender, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s impressive depiction of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that many still consider to be celebrated today.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may have been less than he was at the end of the 19th century, but many consider him to be the protector of parliament against external pressure, which external pressure was, of course, the monarchy in his case.
Whether or not this picture is true remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict, which erupted in the middle of the 17th century, had an effect on the further development of our nation’s destiny, and Cromwell is a recognizable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And we should celebrate the results that we have achieved as Lord Protector, and we should remember them.”
A pig killed in the death of a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Only a man identified as Yuan was found covered in blood with a blood-stained swab next to a pig on the market in the city of Liupanshui in Kujcsou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate the pigs in a breeding facility in Xining City, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from nearby J<0xC3><0xBC>nnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him on the man’s body and discovered that the door to the neighboring pig was open.
According to him, the huge candida in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the 250 kilos of pork marta actually killed the owner.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and they were marked apart,” she told the Guiyang Evening News in her last name, Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pig farm at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told the Evening News that the pig had been shut down so that it could no longer harm others while the police were investigating the tracks at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are reportedly currently in talks about compensation for the man’s death.
Although it does not occur often, it has already been reported in the past when pigs attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram-pound pig in Wales was forcing a farmer into the tractor until he was able to warn the man's wife.
After a 2012 Oregon farmer set up his own pig wall, a Manitoba owner told CBC News that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but can become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, very interesting people... they don't want to hurt you.
They just have to be respected,” he said.
Heavy rains in the wake of the Rosa Hurricane in the southwestern region of the United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it reaches over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa, with a speed of 140 km/h, crashed as a Category 1 hurricane on the eastern coast at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, 620 km southwest.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone rises above the Pacific Ocean and sets westwards towards the western coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, a heavy tropical storm winds up with a heavy tidal wave as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm can bring up to 25 cm of precipitation to some areas of Mexico.
Next, a tropical pair of approaching low-pressure masses will cause heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, the 3–10 cm drop can cause sudden flooding, a flood of debris, and landslides in the desert.
The heavy tropical couple can bring 5–8 cm of precipitation per hour per place, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden flooding can also occur, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is not recommended to take a walk in the desert.
Due to heavy rains, the canyons can turn into rolling rivers, and the swans are accompanied by sudden gusts of wind and dust clouds.
The nearby low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall per location on the southern California coast of the state.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause smaller flows filled with debris and smooth road connections.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Severe tropical storm surges can occur in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, and then on Mondays and Tuesdays the rainfall will spread to wider areas.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and lasted until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature indoses will be seen in the United States, as the angular air masses cool, but the tropics continue to remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences even at short distances on a site.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is about 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that even the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will range from the southern part of the Great Plain to some parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York City will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October are likely to exceed the average temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interview
A total of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels were following the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual violence in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation has not been resolved, and broadcasters have had to cut off the regular schedule due to Friday's last-minute loophole: Jeff Flake has managed to get the Arizona senator to give the FBI a week off.
Ford, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had been caught and tried to get away with it at a high school party at the time.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
More than 20.4 million people were likely to see the confessions on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other listening channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen can hardly measure the number of people who watch the shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many spectators are used to being football decision-makers or Oscar-winners.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, which drew experts who supported the appointment of Kavanaugh from all channels, was the highest, with an average of 5.69 million viewers over the entire day.
In the second place, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
CBS is 3.1, NBC is 2.94, MSNBC is 2.89, and CNN is 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest did not decrease even after the hearing.
The protagonist of Friday’s drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement saying that Senator Kavanaugh is taking down the vocabulary, Friday morning on CNN and CBS was visible as a loud crowd of protesters are being picked up by the jury.
For a few minutes, he was staring at the crowd as he squinted, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country’s public?”
Others cried out to him, “It is in your power to do what is not right for so many women.”
Flake only said that the office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would share his statement at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast channels were then seen live for hours later, as the committee voted on whether to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate.
Flake, however, said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week, as was urged by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake’s conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, were won over by Flake.
Flake made his decision after talks with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was in line with his power, as it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Opponents of Brexit With Political Gameplay
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of endangering the UK’s future and undermining the nation’s interests through their political play.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, will attend the Birmingham Conference of the Conservative Party on 29 September 2018.
In another interview directly on the cover of May's interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was "absolutely impossible for Britain and the EU to handle the same customs."
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, who died.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police have released a video of the merger between Sims and Simpson, and it was also announced that Sims' glasses had fallen during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and put Simpson's DNA on it, which was on the WAFB channel of the CBS network.
After hearing Simpson, the police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to Advocate’s report, the court set the bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge County morgue on Friday, the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck as well.
The office welcomed the Louisiana State Police's special forces on the fugitive criminals, the state police's forensic lab, the university police and the local residents' assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the relevant law enforcement agencies for their “committed and persistent work in finding out the truth.”
The Sims were 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also an LSU basketball player.
Sims scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball player Will Wade said the news of Sims' death had "renewed" and "shocked" the team.
“People are always afraid that something like this will happen,” Wade said.
Vulcans take off from Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital city.
After volcanic activity intensified in the crater, and a total of 183 gas and ash evacuations took place within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The centre also observed several moorings and crevices.
The images shown on the community portals in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, cover the windshields of cars with a thin layer of damp.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of Mexico’s capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists in Catalonia on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence party protesters clashed with the police, and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum on the separation of the people.
A group of <0xC3><0x81>larcos separatists threw eggs and paint dust on the debris traps holding them back, so that the streets, which were once crowded with tourists, were now covered with thick powder.
In the later part of the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain the order with a rubber band.
The slogan "We will not forget, we will not forgive" was echoed by the slogans of the independence party groups and the unity party protesters behind the slogan "Live Spain" for hours against each other.
According to local media reports, 14 people were seen with minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tensions continue to fall in the region that Madrid has declared illegal in its independence efforts, however, following a popular vote on 1 October by the Catalan separatists.
Voters voted with a huge majority in favour of the split, although the turnout was quite low, as the majority of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations with actions that led to violent clashes.
The independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police force.
Although it failed to prevent it, the demonstration ultimately did not proceed on the normal course.
According to the 68-year-old electrical engineer Narcis Termes, who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, there is no longer a chance for Catalonia to gain its independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I have seen my parents throw away joys for which we can vote, but so far our case has been flabbergasted,” he said.
Although last December’s regional elections have succeeded in achieving a significant, even if narrow victory, Catalan independence parties are finding it difficult to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders have been forced to resign or are forced to resign.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old carmaker who recorded a protest in support of the police via his phone, the conflict was set on fire on both sides.
“The situation is more tense,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who has been waiting for the talks since last year, announced that he will start next year in the European Parliament elections.
“With that, I can reject the devaluing of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government represents when I am a candidate in the European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their cars into a house in London
The police arrested a 33-year-old man, a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who drove their car to a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent at around 7:30 p.m. according to British summer time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It may be that at some point they even shot a number on the car.
Livingston beat Rangers 1–0 in Menga's goal
Dolly Menga scored his first goal to secure Livingston's victory
Livingston’s fresh start in the first class was a big surprise to the Rangers by adding Steven Gerrard, who has been working as coach of the ibroxi club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, as Gary Holt's team was put to death with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard, therefore, remained undefeated in the current season of the Scottish league, and next Sunday they face the first-placed Hearts team, who are eight points behind them.
However, the Rangers are still waiting for a game on Thursday against Rapid Wien in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased his divisional innings series to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller, who replaced him last month, has yet to get out with the team.
Livingston has lost a number of positions against the untimelyly-playable guest team
Holt's team could have gotten the lead well ahead of a single goal in the game, as their attacking games caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after slipping to reach Craig Halkett's head-to-head ball in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game, as they were sure that in the recorded game situations they could disturb the guests.
The fateful goal was born out of exactly one such situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who used it to pay for his mid-teens.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were led in the same football match, but the home defense proved unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's door was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, excluding a single situation when Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was thwarted by Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed a goal from Livingston's second free kick.
The cross-eyed ball continued to arrive at the eleventh floor of Livingston, but the defenders were beaten every time. Two penalties were not received by the attacking team: one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton, who entered as a substitute, and the other by his hand.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena Announces Alasdair Lamont as BBC Scotland Announcer
Livingston provided a phenomenal performance and sniffed the babies.
The players were one-on-one excellently listed, and exceeded expectations in a row.
The team’s members and playing style have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt’s efforts have also earned a lot of recognition, as the coach has only upset the team since his arrival.
Several players have also made the most excellent form.
Halket's team captain formed a huge force with his highly organized defense, and Menga was thoroughly bullied by Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt.
The Rangers played with no imagination.
As good as they are sometimes under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to bring that level up.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – by the way, they only managed to break the home defense once – so the Rangers had to get together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found mixed acceptance in Cologne
He described the pleasant atmosphere and well-being of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in their morning meeting in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and EU membership in Turkey.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an traveled to Cologne to celebrate the opening of a new, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
Referring to security concerns, the police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their disapproval of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are a great example of the shared image of the president’s policy, which some Turkish citizens celebrate as heroes, while others see the autocratic regime in it.
Road accident in Deptford: collided with a bicycle car and lost his life
He lost his life on a bicycle when he collided with a car in London.
The caravan took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, located in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the rescuers tried to help the cyclist, who, however, lost his life on the spot.
The collision occurred just a few months after another bicycle-laundering gasket became a fatal victim on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident.
According to a London police statement, the police continue to work to determine the identity of the man in order to inform the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, road closures and bus congestion make transport more difficult, and the authorities advise that cars avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six inmates injured in a riot
Six inmates were injured in clashes in a strictly guarded man’s prison, the prison’s administration said in a statement.
The unrest began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Arms in Worcestershire, and has not yet been able to stop them.
In order to manage the situation, the participants were guided to the site by a special formation named "Tornado". In the disturbance, eight shells are involved, which were pushed back into a wing of the building.
The members of the special formation suffered only minor head injuries, which they were able to provide on-site.
A spokesman for the criminal justice organization said: “A specially trained prison team is dealing with the situation in Long Lartin’s prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence at any level, and we will hand over those responsible to the police, and they can expect additional prison sentences to be downloaded."
The Long Lartin men’s prison has more than 500 convicts, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison's director had to be admitted to hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October, the special formation was also needed to help deliver a serious disturbance, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Rosa Hurricane Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Drought Impacted Areas May Improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but is expected to do just that at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of a hurricane named Rosa are swept through the desert southwestern countryside, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already ordered on Mondays and Tuesdays water readiness from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeastern areas of California and Utah; the readiness of the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Sal.
According to forecasts, the Rosa Hurricane will pass directly through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rains with it.
The Phoenix meteorological service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phoenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
Katrina's hurricane (1967), for example, brought it closer to its limit of 40 miles."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a 50–100 mm drop, which in extreme cases, for example, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, can reach 150 mm.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (the central areas of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, etc.) can be counted as 25–50 mm precipitation, but in some places it can be as high as 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened with flash floods, as the area is currently subject to severe drought.
Despite the fact that flood waters pose a serious threat, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on the south-western terrain of the Assault.
“According to the U.S. Coast Guard, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” the report said.
For the first time, the Rosa Hurricane will hit the coast of Mexico’s Lower California Peninsula.
It will continue to be hurricane-proof, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it will run about 600 km south of the Mexican language Punta Eugenia and will run at approximately 19 km/h to the north.
The storm encounters colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
Thus, Mexico’s coasts are expected to reach again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall can be expected, which significantly increases the chance of floodwaters forming.
“Wetfalls can result in an average of 70-150 mm of precipitation from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where 250 mm of precipitation can occur per location,” the weather.com report said.
Rosa then moves north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression, through Arizona on Tuesday night to the southern territories of Utah.
“The greatest danger to Rosa and her remains will be extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the U.S.,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening flood waters and damage to the water supply in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas should be avoided.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three ten-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they were found with a 16-year-old stab wound in Somerset.
On Saturday, local time, at 4:00 a.m., an injured teenage boy was found in a town called Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, his condition "stable".
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities are asking the public that if anyone has a mobile phone recording of what happened, they should contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "must have suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party"
“Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Democratic Party “had to suffer his anger and resentment.”
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's statement that the man had committed sexual violence against her as a teenager decades earlier.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood by his earlier statements.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans could see with their own eyes” that day Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and fearless character.”
“The waxes released next to Judge Kavanaugh, one of the most outstanding legal experts of our time, are waxes that have an impeccable public service record,” Trump said in a statement.
The president was bluntly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Just five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not going to leave, but I’m going to leave,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are following the “resistance and deterrence” tactic.
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Several hundred people have died in a flood caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, the death toll rises
Many people lost their lives when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a flood on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the nearly six-meter (18-foot) high waves reached the coast at sunset, many collapsed, and destroyed everything that went into their way.
The source price was replaced by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the flood warning came in yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, did not escape immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Indonesian disaster relief agency’s (BNPB) spokesman.
“The spring did not just come in, cars, ponds, houses and everything else lined up from the shore,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching the shore.
There were those who climbed the top of the trees from the price and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
The agency’s aerial footage of the disaster shows a number of destroyed buildings and commercial premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, more aftershocks struck the coastal city.
Earthquakes could be felt in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday's earthquake freed up about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical features may have strengthened the impact of the spring.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was “significant,” thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies of the victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far has been 540, and another 29 people are being searched.
According to Nugroho, the number of people injured and the damage caused could be even higher in the coastal area that is 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication is “completely insecure, we can’t get information” about Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, announcing that the organization’s experts and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is still tragic, but it can be even worse,” he added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about not informing the public about the source price hitting Palut, but the management said the waves had already reached the coast during the release of the alert.
One of the amateurs shared on the social pages can be seen by a man who is trying to warn the street residents of the nearby fountain with desperate cries from the top of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the coast, cars and buildings lined up with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and the surge caused a power outage, making it impossible to communicate in the vicinity of Palu, so the authorities are also able to coordinate rescue work more difficult.
The military has sent relief shipments of cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but officials say the evacuated population will continue to be in high demand for food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate relief work, and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian spring war is more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found refuge under tent pegs set up in the office courtyard, but found traces of horrific destruction along the way, Dosaba said.
“They said they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed,” he added.
“The situation is very bad.”
While the relief teams approached to prepare for the disaster relief work, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this area were unable to travel to Palura. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief and personnel from overseas may only be allowed to enter the territory of the country if the site of the accident is declared a disaster-stricken area at the national level.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a provincial-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government recognises that this is indeed a disaster at the national level, we can allow international assistance services, but so far no announcement has been made.”
On the second night after Friday’s climb and spring break, Palun’s friends and family of the missing were still waiting, hoping that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape can shed some light on the sounds of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal during rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers were able to free a woman who for two days was buried next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the head coach of the Indonesian national ice hockey team, prepared two competitions for the Asian Games, which were finished at the beginning of the month, which this time were held in Indonesia.
In addition to the disappearances, other disciples stayed there at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a windsurfer, what happened to me is a great spiritual burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the skiers, for hours he desperately tried to reach those contestants who had just taken part in the beach festival Palun.
In addition to the messages, however, only one gray pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 was stolen while charging a ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping center
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from one of Brink’s employees, who just filled an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping center, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money-laundering car just emptied out a ATM in the entertainment center and was set to fill up with more banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared bags.
Witnesses have also seen several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the exact number of suspects is not included in the police statement.
Anyone who provides information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper's name changed to Y<0xC3><0xA8>re
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: “The creature that was formerly called Kanye West.”
For a time, 41-year-old Westet has been dubbed Ye by many, and his eighth album, which was released in June, was the title.
The change of name was announced before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release a new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande takes over the role in the show, which, referring to "emotional reasons", said the show's producer.
The new name is not just an abbreviation of the rapper’s current artist’s name – it is also of religious significance to West, according to his earlier revelations.
"I know that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'he'," West said earlier when he spoke about the title of his album with Big Boy's radio host.
So it's you and me, and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and from that only Ye became, which symbolizes the good, the bad, the confusion, all that dwells within us.
The album is a reflection of who we really are.”
Ye is one of the famous rappers who prefers to change their name.
Sean Combs, for example, has previously run as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, has also repeatedly varied by whether his name should be written together, with a tie sign, or perhaps with a capital letter.
Mexico's President Admits He Won't Take the Army Against Civilians
Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, President of Mexico, has promised to never take up the army against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the student protests that took place in the bloodbath.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on participants of a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of violence in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico – he gives a monthly financial reward to students and plans to set up additional free public universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that put young people in the hands of criminal organizations.
The U.S. Should Double the Funding Framework for MI Solutions
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence research and development, the United States should double its support for such targeted research, said Kai-Fu Lee, Microsoft’s AI investor and app developer, in a statement.
He then said that the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country’s goal is to become the world’s number one MI developer by 2030.
“Duplication of the cost framework of MI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly down compared to the U.S. and are on the verge of the next breakthrough of the MI area,” Lee said.
The doubling of research grants could double the chance of the United States taking the next big step in the area of artificial intelligence, CNBC said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the head of the company at Sinovét, in charge of the company of Innovation Ventures.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an MI system that succeeded in defeating the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the technological competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the results of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next such event would take place, as this opens up the opportunity to explore new future formulas.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the state support they need to do their research, Lee said.
"China is not going to shut down the scientific leaders, it’s going to be big companies," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have also signed several major college caps over the past few years to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, the U.S.’s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence could also be greatly helped by the immigration policy change.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a doctorate degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s national natural science foundation provides support in a similar way to the employees of academic institutions, as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, academics, and the quality of their work.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee named the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently spends $100 million a year in support of MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which was designed to set up a national security MI committee, has not taken any further steps in the matter for months.
In Macedonia, a referendum is held on changing the name of the country
The population of Macedonia voted in Sunday’s referendum on whether to change the country’s name to the “North Macedonia Republic”. With this move, a decades-long disagreement with Greece was resolved, which prevented the country from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, has argued that the name of its northern neighbor indicates that it is in need of a Greek territory of the same name, and has thus far denied NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the new name of the state, but according to nationalist opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, he became doubtful whether there would be a 50% turnout rate necessary for the valid referendum.
The question on the ballots reads as follows: “Do you support the country’s NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”.
Supporters of the change of name, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia to be one of the countries that has risen in the ruins of Yugoslavia to be a chance for EU and NATO membership.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient member of parliament has stated that he feels obliged to consider the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
According to the State Election Commission, there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout rate has so far reached only 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (in the end 66% of registered voters took part).
“I came to vote for my children because we have our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who gave his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Macedonian Prime Minister, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, along with the change of name, put down the Voks in Strumica, at the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO alliance.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage stage, as well as chairs and tents for people boycotting the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we would like to join with a proud, raised head, not through the whistleblower,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be counted on investments in Macedonia, which is in great need of a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country’s population is fundamentally supportive of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after his vote.
He added that the “yes” vote “means securing the future of the country.”
According to the results of a survey published by the Macedonian Polytological Research Institute last week, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedon is expected to have a participation rate of 57% on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the polls, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be more than 50% with at least one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western party government, which came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player gets full Brighton defense by scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played hard for Brighton to win Manchester City 2–0 at Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinian fighter received a pass in the middle as the first step of the attack, and
He came out in the open between the three Brighton defenders.
Then four green fields surrounded Aguero.
He knocked out one of the defenders and then ran more near the 11th of Brighton.
Then he went to the left of the Sterling who appeared there.
The English fighter gave the ball back to Aguero, who finished the action with his right leg, entering the right side of the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan's gate.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play for 55 minutes or more.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
With the initial advantage of Sterling's action, he managed to make the blues in the English championship clash.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero, who lives in the Brighton area, received a great pass.
He launched a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he would have started Sterling in the long run.
He could only kick the ball into the gate at the battle of the blues before slipping off the base line.
City will play next Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, starting at 12:55 a.m. with Hoffenheim in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies
Since the Nationals team has given up the opportunity to enter the postseason, there was no reason to really try.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is looking forward to a Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the opposing team still has a chance to play. The Rockies have a match advantage ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers at the NL Westball base.
The Rockies secured at least one thrilling spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title was still waiting for them.
“Regardless of the fact that we don’t have a chance anymore, we can stand up against them so that in Denver, the mood of the audience and the other team is expected to be on the rooftop all year round.
It’s so nice to be on the road like this!”
The Nationals team still has to pick the starting game for Sunday, but according to the news, in this situation, Scherzer will be the bowler.
For Scherzer, who took part in boxing on Thursday, this will be his 34th Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hand Washington player this season is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 games.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president also pointed to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones – I personally don’t go, but I’m basically going, that’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these horrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see with their own eyes.
They are really determined, and they are able to use any means to regain power, which is visible from the bad mood and the subsidence.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they kill to have control in their hands, they have power. That’s what they want, control and power, but we don’t leave ourselves.”
According to the president, the Democrats are introducing “resistance and obstruction.”
“They’ve seen it all in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and ill-informed and underhanded and lying.”
As the name suggests, Dianne Feinstein was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which declared the mass gathering to be a mass massacre.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you scrape the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, no, no, no, let's wait — all this with a really bad body language, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer in favour of diversity.
It does not tolerate those who are free to say what they think
I was not at all surprised when in my own party the activists of the Momentum decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in the long line of Labour representatives who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has been treated in a similar way, for which he has stood up against anti-Semitism in a disorderly manner.
In my case, the censor didn't like the fact that I didn't get along with Jeremy Corbyn.
Moreover, the importance of responsible economic policy, the issue of national security and Europe, which ironically are the issues in which Jeremy also did not agree with the previous leaders.
At the invitation of the working party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, he said they would like a “hostile and productive meeting”.
For the majority of my eight years as a local representative of the Workers’ Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, the tone has changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, more courtly” policy has been forgotten if it has ever been realized at all.
It is increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This trend began not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues, whom I thought were similar to our political approach, have been waiting for more and more times to turn their backs on my individual opinions, and have been doing some things like
After all my public speeches, no matter what I said, they start to snore on social media, they demand my resignation, they criticize the politics that are in the middle, and they tell me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Workers’ Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments I make are usually about politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues, who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but are not running away.
The most disturbing aspect of today’s politics is that such attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the need for the Labour Party to support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up on diversity, and with all the “uncertainty” initiatives and all the amendments to the electoral rules, the party has become increasingly entrenched.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to take it back, not to be so vocal, and then “everything will be okay.”
That’s not why I went on a political path.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, because I was upset that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost remodeled, and then I fought for better access to the most vulnerable as a local councilor and as a school district.
I have never hidden my political views under a veil, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
At Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on which topics I disagree with the current administration.
For those who supported the initiative on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to devote so much time and energy to turn it around.
However, my most important message is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that I will not be afraid of any threat of any change or political purpose, I will not be afraid of it.

Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr unhurtly breaks to the top
Two late attempts slightly changed the result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s deserved victory in the most fun match of the day, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one out of ten teams to score.
Thanks to their unrivalled defense and overarching use of the situation, they have won, so that the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a lot of challenges in our matches so far, but we’re still unbeatable, so there’s every reason for happiness,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We have to recognize that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we have.”
Grant Anderson made his 14th-minute try, from which Frazier Climo scored a point, to the Ayr advantage. Thanks to the yellow card to captain Rory Hughes loaned by the Warriors, the batsman could not have scored a draw from the bat.
Climo rubbed Ayr's defense with a penalty, just in the half-time, then scored from a single try, so the first half ended with a score of 17-5 in favor of Ayr.
Melrose strongly started the second half, with Patrick Anderson's try being appreciated by Baggot, reducing the team's deficit to five points.
The game then lasted for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to take off from the field, and in the continuation Ayr further increased his advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose babies managed to get off with Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of the Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's attempt on humans, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to close again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card, for which he had unballed Clim<0xC3><0xB3>, MacPherson showed a touch down from the penalty line behind the Ayr rowing team.
Climo appreciated it, which was repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry off to try his fifth home run.
The protagonist of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
One of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be moving towards the hospitality industry: light has come to the fore of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with former comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the next season will be the ninth in the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to take advantage of Glasgow's "floating hospitality industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have a beach, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the sailor's command, decorated with stained glass, in La Paz.
In the public buildings, the ocean-blue flags are waving.
Marine bases, from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, announce the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which does not have a coastline, still has vivid memories of the lost coast, which was captured by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, and there is a strong desire to relive the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the strongest for decades now, for Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice’s ruling in October, which will end five years of consultations.
“Bol<0xC3><0xAD>via has the ball, which, with the spirit of cohesion and peace, seduces people who are waiting for the final development in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivian escorts are ignoring the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will stand next to Bolivia, and after decades of rapsodic attitudes in Chile, it will be mandatory to attend a panel of judges in Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a conflicting fight to be waged for next year’s re-election, may lose much of his sentence on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that the court will probably not decide in Bolivia’s favour, and that would not change much in the situation if its decision were still favorable for Bolivia.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to judge over Chilean territories, and it has also stated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born almost six months after the closing talks indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on international law in Chile.
In addition, the last four years did not help the Bolivian case, but even brought it back.
“The question of the sea exit has been addressed by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“Because of the hostile rhetoric of Morales, the welfare of the rest of the Chileans has dried up.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the finding that the judicial decision-making process would have been unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in its relations with Chile" and a chance for "both of them to come out well from the conclusion of the 139-year dispute," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would have used the maritime debate to forge a political advantage from it.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment gives us a chance to see: it’s time to move beyond the past.”
North Korea: There is no nuclear decommissioning until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore summit.
He made the remark when it seemed as though Mike Pompeo had succeeded in resuming the U.S. Secretary of State's nuclear deal, more than three months after North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un held a summit in Singapore.
According to Ri, I “want” to believe that stopping the ongoing sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea into orbit.
Washington is horrified at the adoption of the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards disarming.
Both Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, widespread scepticism overwhelms Phenjan’s commitment to disposing of the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the country’s security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of Kim-Trump.
The Paris Fashion Shows featured the huge headlines that will soon be appearing in top-of-the-line stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection, or you want to completely cover the day, then you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headscarves as part of their 2019 spring/summer collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish Paris Fashion Week audience.
In the summer, non-practitioner hats have created a sensation on Instagram, and the fashion designers above have also put their remarkable works on display.
Valentino’s most visible piece was an oversized beige hat, which was decorated with a pendulum, wide-brimmed, and almost completely pierced the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements, there appeared a gem-encrusted buckwheat, a magic wand, and even an pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a man’s head warm.
Thom Browne also produced a selection of bizarre masks, just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together, and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of the haute couture.
One of these pieces is similar to a diving mask, complemented by a pipe and glasses, and the other one is painted as a slender bucket of ice.
If you come across these spectacular pieces, then you are in luck.
According to the forecasts of stylists, it may happen that the huge hats are already on their way to the top category of clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path “La Bomba” carved out, a 60 cm wide karima sandstone that we’ve all seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the little practical hat that conquers the social pages showed another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of salmon, which is almost as big as the swimsuit model that holds it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated by raffia skirts and on top of it is a white leather grip – was one of the highlights of Jacquemus’ spring/summer 2019 La Riviera collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in the top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer has made such an elementary impact out of everyone’s reach that it’s hard to deny it.
John Edward: Language Knowledge Is Essential for World Citizens
The Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the recent high-level test results, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is only further strengthened in sports, in the arts, in music and in other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are studying at institutions of this nature represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) that strive to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen career, and for what position they occupy as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is the opportunity to design and implement customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak in a language you understand, you get to your head.
But if you speak in his language, it goes to his heart.”
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools across the country brought the best results from foreign languages.
68 per cent of all students who learn a foreign language have achieved a higher A grade (over 85 per cent result).
Based on the data collected from the 74 SCIS schools, 72 percent of students received a grade A from the Mandarin language, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved grade A.
These results also underline the fact that Scottish independent schools are seen as essential knowledge of foreign languages, which, to their knowledge, will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Today, languages, as chosen subjects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both in independent and other schools of nature.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Committee on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17 percent of employers said that it is difficult to fill vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
From this we can also see that language learning is becoming increasingly necessary for young people to pursue a successful career.
As more and more jobs await the knowledge of foreign languages, language knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what kind of career someone chooses, if they have learned a foreign language, they will acquire a lifelong knowledge from which the obvious advantage comes.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically provides a competitive advantage for applicants who speak multiple languages.
According to a YouGov survey — in which 4,000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013 — 75 percent of respondents were not able to speak in a single foreign language well enough to speak to others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent of respondents.
That is why it is important that we continue to focus on the language teaching of children.
Speaking in several languages, especially in the languages of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, with which, as an adult, they can apply for more important jobs.
In Scotland, all schools will deal with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will be teaching languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance for the UK by 2020.
Regardless of the area of interest of the child, you will also be able to learn several optional languages at independent schools, and you will train teachers who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed in whatever the future holds for them.
It is not difficult to see that in today’s global business environment, languages continue to be vital in terms of a country’s future, and education needs to reflect that as well.
In this respect, the knowledge of modern languages should be treated as an “international communication skill”.
Independent schools offer the opportunity for choice, diversity and quality education to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well – that’s how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
It won’t take long for fans to sit around and watch LeBron James race for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the pre-season opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the track is still questionable.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers whistleblower Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely only play for a limited time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the pre-season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the pre-season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
In Donald Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia, a long line of campaign events begins tonight.
This will be the first of Trump’s five needed events next week, including stops like the one in support of Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that Trump has been delayed by a vote to confirm his candidacy for the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to rally supporters for the next midterm election, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose their seats when they run for office.
When does Trump begin tonight’s West Virginia event, and where can he follow online?
Trump’s speech at Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) will begin at 7 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can also follow Trump’s West Virginia rally online via live YouTube.
Trump is likely to be in touch with his top justice candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, this week’s hearing, which has been particularly tense in light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate’s affirmative vote has been suspended for up to a week.
However, the primary goal of the events that suddenly resurface is to help the situation of Republicans before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the upcoming five-week event will serve to “activate voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“In order to be able to control Congress, it is such a critical point in his political plans that the president will visit as many states as possible. We look forward to a close campaign period,” a spokesman for Reuters said in a statement.
This evening’s event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling “may also bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and may even be included in Pittsburgh’s media coverage,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time on Saturday in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican nominee, Patrick Morrisey, who according to the polls is not in a favorable position.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intervene personally to better fit in with the investigations," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team struggles with full breadth ahead of Sunday’s individual to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup was in great need of four games on Saturday afternoon.
The thrill of luck and momentum here and there is a sport concept that is quite airy, yet every player believes in it, especially in competitions such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead, and only four of them have the advantage, so we can say we have the ball right here,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading by four points, and twelve are still available.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they’ve finally got a little backlash, and more of everything they can do is encourage, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and both got three points out of the four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His <0xC3><0x96>bl<0xC3><0xB6>s victory cries became louder as he advanced with the round, infused with a critical twist and balanced in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in a double disadvantage after two.
The decisive knockout of the match resulted in a similar cheering at the 15th hole, a kind of one that can convince the viewer that not everything is lost for the American team yet.
“You just have to dig deep into yourself and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what’s waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a mark on themselves.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s most popular pair, were able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe is strange, but it has brought four out of four couples to worship, and it seems they can’t make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to perform above the pair on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to the dynamic of this series, and the dynamic between them and the audience who supported them, they have become the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is better waiting for the Sun to secure Europe’s victory from the Le Golf National track than Fleet.
It would be best to win at one time, at different holes.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning when he played alongside Alex Noren.
Once and twice he made two strikes over the par in the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swedish, throwing them into a wave valley from which they had no chance to escape.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are extremely fun looking closely thanks to the interactions of the couples. You can observe who gives you advice, what you do not give, and how you can change the strategy at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it starts with a significant advantage for him on the last day, but this four section has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, although many of them are missing from the American side.
Europe starts last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after Saturday’s four-ball and four-game finishes with a 10-6 draw against the United States.
Both Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race, winning two victories against the weakened Tiger Woods, raising the gap to four points on the Le Golf National track.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team – who are trying to regain a trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago – dominated the series against the consistently flawed American team in the morning four-ball games, winning 3-1.
America witnessed greater resistance during the four games, bringing in two matches, but they were not able to break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in the series, while he and Molinari – referred to only as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the quarterfinals, they beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau for a set 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturdays, sometimes even sniffed his talent, but out of 29 games, he lost 19 of the four balls and four of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning fours, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and in the four of them defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the world's first and third-ranked pair.
However, Europe did not succeed on this pleasant, windy day, from Paris to the southwest.
Three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans with two points on Saturday how to do it.
They scored a two-and-a-half victory against Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinals after losing the first two.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has only managed to come back from a four-point deficit in individual competitions twice, although an undecided team of Furyk's defending team has managed to keep the trophy.
However, after only two days of being the second best, a Sunday counter-attack seems pretty improbable.
"Excluded" to unilaterally disqualify North Korea if it does not trust its negotiating partner
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions had only increased its distrust of the United States, and had ruled out that under such circumstances the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho told the World Organization’s annual meeting that North Korea had taken “significant and high-level steps” over the past year, for example, halted nuclear and missile tests, closed the site of the nuclear tests, and promised to keep the nuke on.
“Unfortunately, we don’t see similar response from the Americans,” he said.
“We feel, at the loss of confidence in America, that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we are unilaterally and firstly disposing of it.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment at Washington's opposition to the idea of a "long-term" nuclear disarmament, which, according to the script, would benefit from North Korea's rewards for the steps it has taken so far, his statement is still a sobering and sober one.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, which was held in Singapore on June 12, during which he vowed to cut off Kim’s hair.
North Korea is trying to make a point by the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. believes that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not even been allowed to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament, and with sanctions it increases the pressure to force its will on us, as well as to protest against who can declare the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can force us to the knees is the desire of those who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicion.”
Ri did not mention that he would have planned a second summit between Kim and Trump, however, which the U.S. president made a separate speech at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister said the meeting between Kim and South Korean President Mun-Jsein had taken place in the past five months, adding: "If the country involved in nuclear disarmament was South Korea, it would not be the United States of America, the United States, the United States, the United States.
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the North American continent’s target intake with North Korean missiles is inevitable after Trump, “the evil president,” called Kim “a rocket man,” called him “a rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump – who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year – praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarming, but he also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done, and that the sanctions have not been lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time limit, meaning “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia also argued that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must be complied with in an orderly manner until we have reached the actual, final, demonstrable nuclear deal.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously upheld sanctions against North Korea in order to re-impose funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met in Riga during the United Nations General Assembly, and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been very successful.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of bringing about “aggressive demands” on the country.
During a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to install a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States is to take "sufficient steps."
According to Mun, the “promising steps” mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore, as well as steps that could lead to normalizing the existing relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are being taught to get enough rest.
A new subject at Harvard University this year has put students to sleep more, also fighting the culture of the space-winning cat that has been heated by caffeine all night.
An academic has come to the conclusion that students from the world’s number one universities are often completely lost when it comes to how to care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged him to prepare for the course that he had previously held a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I facing this now, as a finalist?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised him,” he told the Telegraph.
During this year’s first-ever course, students are introduced to how the proper sleep habits have a fundamental effect on their learning and sports performance, in addition to having a positive effect on their overall overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to start the course because during the course, students were found to be excreted in an extraordinary way.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a college room, where students can click on the coffee cup, curtains, sneakers, and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, by saying that it has a negative effect on sports.
In another part, participants are introduced to how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of developing heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancers.
They present their map of the university’s territory with interactive icons, so that the participants are cornered to reflect on the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to this knowledge – just as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture continues to flourish, in which it is considered an achievement to spend one or two nights, he said, adding that the increasing pressure of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students is resulting in an increasing number of problems.
Adequate and high-quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even to protect them from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain to go hungry in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old Californian student who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year Harvard was the first to take one of the professor’s courses.
He said that those heard there opened their eyes and were encouraged to swords alongside the start of a university-level training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before placing themselves in the competition field.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning to fall asleep, an alarm to wake up, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the electric screens and the LED light sources, which could cause them to sneeze.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga beats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bombed Steven Gerrard's disintegrated team in Livingston's 1-0 defeat.
The Ibroxias tried to win their first foreign win from their 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second bout from Gary Holt's 18 games as a manager, so he lost eight points to the Premier League.
Menga was knocked down seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' unmotivated team didn't even come close to equalising.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston dropped to third place, leaving Hibernian behind only because of the goal difference.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties after the coaster’s Calum Spence suffered a head injury due to a medical condition that was likely caused by an item dropped off the guest’s sight.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that made it to the Betfred Cup final with the sacking of Ayr.
Holt joined Livingston with the same 11 men who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to have watched his perfectly-tailored team take over his opponent's game where he only got it.
Although the Rangers led the ball in the knockout, Livingston took more with what he got.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga kicked Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate with his first pitch, but the midfielder was unable to sell the sizzle.
Keaghan Jacobs landed on Craig Halkett's team captaincy, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, found only the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson hindered his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were able to shoot only the first two half-time caps, but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox goalkeeper, barely bothered Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Even though Livi's attempt in the 34th minute was against the course of the match so far, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, only for their hard work.
The Rangers re-distributed a cigar forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for an easy finish.
Gerrard decided to take a break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kentre, and this almost immediately expressed its effect on the game when he pushed the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who brought the impressive form, was blocked in time.
Livingston still managed to play exactly the game that was right for him, and Lithgow and Halkett were scratching the long balls one after the other.
Mort's team could have scored a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and grabbed Jacobs' position before Lithgow could have scored from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, who was the Rangers' replacement, tried to outrun another eleven when he teamed up with Jacobs, but now he couldn't convince Thomson.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger calculator
A detail from our "Sunday morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a device known as the Geiger counter, which could be used to detect and measure radioactivity.
The Geiger counter has since become one of the foundational tools of science, and the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, became a part of pop culture:
Man: "So what's the miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be found with it.
If you raise this headphone, you can hear the sound of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "Listen, now you're pretty pathetic!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in the invention of the bearer of his name.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells.
As part of a treatment, a given vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient, and then modify them in a lab.
In this way, they are able to "see" their protein, which is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the extraction of immune cells from the patient; they are modified in the laboratory to "see" the protein called HER2, which is a common companion to several types of cancerous disease; and then to reset the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results allow us to conclude that there is a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “increases the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and endometrial cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which is based on highlighting immune cells and "teaching" them on how to attack cancer cells, was previously successfully used in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West’s role in the MAGA-cap has culminated in a smear campaign supporting Trump.
It didn't burn too well
Kanye West was ousted at Saturday Night Live's studio after an unrelated announcement in which he honored U.S. President Donald Trump and then announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night in his Make America Great Again cap, Ghost Town, he began to speak out against the Democrats and once again stressed that he supports Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, the question is, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
If racism were interested, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Although it was not released, the video about West's vocabulary was uploaded by humorist Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to throw a joke out of the West by charging it.
West even complained to the audience that they were peeing behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were scared behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
They're scared!
And they said I was in the submerged place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a crowded place? I’ll take my Superman hat up because it means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His apparitions were accompanied at least twice by whistleblowers from the audience, and the actors of the SNL were visibly embarrassed, according to one witness who told Variety: “The whole studio was wrapped in silent silence.”
Westet was called in instead of singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West raised more questions when she presented her song "I Love It" in a Perrier glass.
West, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, said in a tweet: “One of the bravest minds: THEIR CHILDREN, TOGETHER THE WHOLE.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West simply “was himself, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided not to reward anyone (by buying his music or his fashion pieces or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe to be of an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
She's free.
“We are too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and now he is “the creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's now in the press of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and P. Diddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the short-lived legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Manslaughter Attempts to Accuse Belfast Restaurant Delayer
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was detained in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to a police statement, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, Star of the Battle of the Thrones Finds Exaggerated Manhood to Be Harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow of the Battle of the Thrones, and he often wields a sword in his violent, medieval fantasy series.
However, the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotypical cat heroes, noting that seeing such heroes can often make the little boys feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought there was “something wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of excessive manhood in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old co-star, Rose Leslie, said she thought it would be very important to cure the problem.
“I’m personally deeply concerned about this matter – how did the portrayal of manhood become so distorted?” asked the actor.
“What have we taught men in their childhoods about the problem we are facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of manhood, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing the thought process, he added: “What is it that was born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys, which makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because it clearly seems that something is wrong with young men.”
In the interview, Kit stated that after the summer season of the series, he will not be included in the Tr<0xC3><0xB3>nok Warfare prequels or sequels, because "he has the power of battlecruisers and horses".
From November, he will reprise his role in the film Kit Sam Shepard True West, which is about a producer and his brother who continues his raping lifestyle.
The actor said the best thing he got from the battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he knew while making the series.
“I met my wife on the set, so I can thank my future family and my life ahead of me for the series,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who was the character of Kit, was in love with Jon Snow in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new patients in China has increased by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14% in the country.
According to health officials, this means more than 820,000 people.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to the previous ones, there is a change in the fact that a significant majority of newly infected people get the disease sexually.
In the past, the disease has spread to parts of China through the transfusion of infected blood at a rapid rate.
However, at a conference in J<0xC3><0xBC>nnan province, health officials stated that the number of such cases has since dropped to near zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV sexually is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease in these relationships is widespread in many cases due to improper sexual protection.
The Chinese government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV drugs since 2003 as part of a programme to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff members had leaked data from Republican senators and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff had disclosed the personal details of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, the claims in question have been spread to "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the address and telephone number of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information was posted on the internet on Thursday, and the publisher's person is unknown, but is certain that they were made public from Capitolium Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment by Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's nominee.
The impeachment took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, can be linked to the IP address Waters, which can be identified as the source, and information about one of Waters’ staff members has also been released.
“These allegations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false,” Waters continued.
– The staff member has no responsibility for the disclosure of the information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false.”
Waters' statements were quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry refusal,” Fleischer wrote.
“On this basis, it appears that Waters does not have the blood temperature required for the representative office.
If someone is being equated with something they haven’t done, they can’t react angrily.
You can't behave like that.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared his reaction to Kavanaugh's seemingly Democratic party criticism, which some critics said was too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters's seat as a Republican candidate in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" of the allegations.
“We make sure that the perpetrators are identified,” Waters continued, “and that they are legally held accountable for all actions that endanger or harm any member of my staff.”
Johnny English Recaptures Rowan Atkinson's Thrilling Spy Game
Now it has become a legacy that we are looking for references to Brexit in every British-related film, and there can be no exception to this franchise that runs under the name Johnny English, which can be classified as an action-adventure/parody category, the first part of which is in the title Johnny English in 2003, the second part in the title Johnny English, the second in the title Johnny English.
Will the new export product of the British nation become sarcastic, self-parodizing satires, in which we live by our own obvious seduction?
It is so certain that the eye-grabbing, rubbery, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for another return – it is already clear from his name that this comic character was created so that he could not see the horrors of his native English-speaking countries in his films.
Johnny English, of course, is a shot by a secret agent who imagines himself to be overcome by his bizarre wits, so he reminds a little of Clouseau's supervisor, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally of the guy who was on his way to the press of his only key in 2012.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, and who left chaos behind him everywhere.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in a medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then there the rotors slid on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comic vein is well-appreciated in the film, but the film’s humor doesn’t really work, even if it’s superfluous, as today’s franchises with a “complex” sound like the James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are brave enough to touch the humor on the screen.
To feel that the film’s humor is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English’s fluffy, left-handed adventures do not reach the level of imagination and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network’s super-secret online network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the biggest horror agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last corner in the coffin of the self-proclaimed and divisive prime minister, whose political popularity is otherwise in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically portrayed by Theresa May, and to whom everything is written out of a character that is otherwise poor.
The intelligence advisors will record to him that since the identity of each active agent has been revealed, a calming agent has to be assigned to the job.
This relaxed agent, of course, is none other than the two-legged Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at an outstanding school since his retirement, but, unlike the teaching material, teaches children to spy – here are of course funny scenes, while the English version of the song "Rocks" is called "Rocks".
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he rendezvous with his former, much-suffering arms carrier, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has since married, and has also been married to a seafaring captain, who always has a mouth full of his own – the captain is portrayed by Vicki Pepperdine, who has called for much better roles.
Thus, the two-legged pair of his superior national security services, Batman and Robin, are back in action and face Ophelia Bulletov<0xC3><0xA1>, who is portrayed by beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of true purpose.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly being recruited by the charismatic IT billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is shaping up.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they light up a fancy French restaurant disguised as a waitress, and then, in the midst of an amazing twist, they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta, and English unleashes the hell out of it with a VR-head.
These stations are needed to get to the final development, but any fun and twisting has been achieved, perhaps a little too much to make an impression on a children's film.
The end result is pretty average.
As with the other Johnny English films, the question still arises: can the British film industry not finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his virginity?
Britain’s Labour Party denies it would be able to implement a four-day job while paying the British for a five-day job
Jeremy Corbyn’s working party is working on a radical plan: to introduce the four-day work week. All this so that the workers would work for a five-day wage.
The party is said to want workers to benefit from the benefits of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by providing employees with an extra day off, thanks to increased revenue.
According to the plan, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same as before.
According to the sources, the idea “would” be part of the party’s economic programme, which aims to be on the workers’ side of the balance sheet language in the country.
The idea of a four-day work week is also supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “It is likely that the political review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to the next, but the four-day work is an idea that fits well with the party’s program, which would shift the language of balance towards the workers in the economy, and also fit into the party’s comprehensive industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, and the Green Party had already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day job.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Workers’ Party said: “The four-day work is not part of the party’s policies, and the issue is still not on the agenda.”
John McDonnell, the shadow finance minister, presented his vision for the socialist revolution that affected the economy at last week’s Labour Party conference.
McDonnell said he is struggling to regain power from the “unscrupulous directors” and the “residues” of the companies.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be realized, then the shareholders of the water supply companies would not receive back the full profits for them, for a working party government would use “rebates” as a punishment for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that, according to his plans, he would make the workers a member of the board of directors, and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which could group 10% of the shares of private sector companies into the workforce by <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have been on the "60 Minutes" show about whether the FBI press regarding Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote on Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court will be held at least one week later on the basis of the original date.
In an interview with "60 Minutes" on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find anything they could think of.
Kennedy seemed to be less committed than his South Carolina co-worker.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called for the case to be opened, after the charges were brought, and I asked, "Did you?"
The answer was clear and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and they need extremely serious charges to make me think about myself," Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett has strictly denied the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival, and has it managed to mitigate poverty?
On Saturday, New York begins the annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival. At the festival, world stars perform to stand up for a truly noble purpose: for the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held seven times now, and it is expected that tens of thousands of people will be attending Central Park’s Grand Parade, where participants will be able to enjoy not only Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes’ performance, but also draw attention to the 20th anniversary of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival was organized for the first time in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international advocacy group, which aims to reduce poverty by attracting more and more people to the active fight against poverty.
You can get a free ticket to the concert (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket) for certain tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a leader of the project, answering a phone call, or sending a call to another person.
But, in fact, how successful has the Global Citizen have been in achieving the goals set out in the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert tag to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clickivism” when people feel like they’re contributing to a single online case?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped the world’s leaders allocate $37 billion to policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and announcements were made from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid out or collected during fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the money raised has already directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and performers in the UK, whose goal is to "help children reach their potential". The organization's pledge to raise $45 million as a result of its pledge to raise $45 million.
“With the support of the UK government, as well as donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can expose social injustices and malnutrition to the footnotes of the history books,” said Mr. Tracey U.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions have prompted the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has allocated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen’s website is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be accounted for?”.
According to the Global Citizen, “There will be a long and arduous path in which we sometimes stumble and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we are also reaching our goal because together we are stronger.”
Among others, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e will perform at this year’s New York event, and the hosts will be Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. Navy 'blockage' to prevent Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington would even engage the navy against the Russian energy carriers’ market, so that Russian energy could not, for example, reach the Middle East,” said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Home Secretary for the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia’s active presence in Syria – particularly as regards Russia’s operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government – is merely a pretext for Russia’s acquisition of new energy markets.
“I think they’re just there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the interior minister, there are ways to prevent the Russians.
“The U.S. is able to ensure that the sea lanes are open and can be pulled under the blockade if necessary, so it can make sure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of a non-profit event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group, by the way, defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran and noted that these are practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in much the same way: by using existing energy carriers, as well as introducing new ones,” Zinke said, while calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing out the country’s fossil-based energy.
The announcements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, depriving Russia of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why the Trump administration’s top officials, including the president himself, are convincing Germany to reject the “wrong” pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Moscow “the last one” of Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity doubles, thereby increasing to 110 billion cubic meters, 11 billion dollars in North Stream 2 pipelines are only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so fiercely opposed to economic considerations to the project, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I suspect that we are at the same point of view as regards the fact that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely,” said Russian Energy Minister Perry Perry, a Russian energy minister.
The U.S.’s attempt to persuade the public has been backfired, as Germany has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as it has kept itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Union (BDI) Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin after his last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "takes great care" to run for the presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she “takes great care” to run for the presidency.
Warren, in Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering the departure.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and put the poorly functioning government in place, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take it very seriously to start for the presidency.”
At the town meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he believes he is “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has been vocally critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh as the top justice candidate.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need to press the FBI before the vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should start for the presidency in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk’s Political Analysis Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren were “highly likely” to vote for the presidency.
32% of them support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick’s former governor’s presidential nomination was supported by the majority of respondents, 38% supported, and 48% opposed.
In the 2020 presidential election, the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have also emerged.
According to an Associated Press report, Biden will decide by January whether to leave.
Sarah Palin's Track Palin refers to PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin served one year in Iraq after signing up in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
“All my son has been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the horrific consequences of PTSD, and the wounds our soldiers are going home with,” Sarah Palin told the audience at a rally in the state of Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of his son the "elephant in the room" and said that his son, like the other war veterans, "changed, came back hard, and continued to walk in his head, that he had enough respect for all the other services he served."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla police, said that Track Palin was allegedly armed with a gun, a drunk man who had committed domestic violence.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of refugee policy
18 states and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new U.S. refugee policy, which means that those who are fleeing violence by gangs or within their families cannot receive asylum.
A letter from experts from 18 different states, as well as representatives from Washington, D.C., was written in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who is attacking policy in court.
The full name of the petition for Grace vs. Sessions, initiated by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal policy, was not made public in August.
The applicant's wife said she and her partner and "sons of violent crime" had been raped, but U.S. officials on July 20 rejected her asylum application.
The woman is being held in custody in Texas.
Attorneys of the Grace-supporting states El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala were described as places where many of the asylum applications to the United States come from, because in these countries, there is a continuing problem with the crimes committed and the crimes committed by the perpetrators.
The new U.S. refugee policy has withdrawn a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) in 2014 that allows immigrants without documents to flee from violence within the family of undocumented immigrants.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.’s attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards decades of state, federal and international law.”
“In accordance with federal law, all asylum claims must be dealt with according to the facts and circumstances in the case at hand, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter said.
The lawyers also stated in the letter that the policy to reject immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill in the lowest-level jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges dealing with the refugee camps not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and crimes that have been committed against them.
“The right of asylum is for those who leave their country because of racial, religious reasons, national affiliation, persecution or political conviction for belonging to a particular social group, or because of fear of persecution,” Sessions said in a statement.
The right of asylum has not been invented to solve all the problems of people all over the world, every day – let them be of any serious nature.
Undefeated rescue action in Palu, the death toll doubled, rescue operations are running a race over time
The situation of the survivors is increasingly unpredictable.
“Everyone is very excited,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as her rebellious son is being reassured by the disaster at one of the evacuation centers in Palu.
The rescuers add the bodies every minute.
We have very little drinking water.”
Some of the residents returned to their homes devastated to escape from the wreckage, which can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are unable to provide for people.
Some of the injured, including the broken back and shoulder Dwi Haris, were transported to Palui Katonai Hospital, where patients were seen outside the hospital building due to high-strength aftershocks.
The man’s eyes filled with tears as he remembered how the fifth-floor hotel room where he and his wife and daughter lived was engulfed in a devastating earthquake.
“There was no time to flee.
“I think I was stuck in the collapsed walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Threatening the Country with Propaganda Ads
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper reported a four-page ad in a U.S.-China trade-related newspaper.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to his ad appearing in the China Daily Des Moines Register — Iowa’s largest-selling newspaper — while accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, some U.S. officials told Reuters it represents a new phase against Washington in its increasingly strong move to put China under pressure.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to popularize trade with their countries through advertising, an increasingly intense trade war is raging between Beijing and Washington, during which they impose new and more tariffs on each other’s import products.
According to U.S. and Chinese experts, the tariffs imposed by the Chinese at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who has been serving for several cycles, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses, as the state of Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion paper published on Sunday in the Des Moines Register that "China continues to intimidate our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper, we can hardly find critical audio articles. The Chinese press does not at all faithfully reflect the different, different opinions of the Chinese people about the increasingly turbulent growth prospects of the Chinese economy, because the media in the media in P<0xC3><0xA1>goszk<0xC3><0xA1>
Branstad added that "one of China's most famous newspapers was not willing to bring down" the article, but did not name it.
According to analysts, Republicans may disqualify female voters from Kavanaugh ballots before midterm elections
According to analysts, it may turn out that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Brett Kavanaugh’s top court nominee in the crosshairs of sexual harassment charges, which could lose the support of female voters, especially in the run-up to the election.
The case sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be retracted, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about whether the latest FBI printing, initiated by Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, would be enough to reassure angry voters, he said.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in a Washington, D.C.-based newspaper.
According to Mic, on Friday morning in the Senate hallway, some protesters chanted, “November is coming!” because despite the testimony of the Republican-controlled Justice Committee, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford decided not to withdraw the Kavanaugh sign.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an astonishing extent,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“A lot of people say it’s been pretty high so far, and that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the city’s insecure female voters and young people (18-29 years old) who, while not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, analysts have suggested that he can return to the Republicans if they continue to stand by Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he is accused of sexual harassment by the highest bidder.
"The Republican Party has made a mistake on the offensive ground," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“This is not just about the committee vote and the closing vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how Ford acted,” said Guy Cecil, a Democrat who helped elect the U.S.
It seems, however, that the Americans are quite divided on whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is believed to be a little more than Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents fully believed Ford’s testimony, and 35% of respondents gave the same answer at Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that from Ford.
As a result of Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford’s claims, as is the case with another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified a week ago under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted him.
Ramirez said the top court candidate showed her the sex organ at a party in the 1980s, when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the world network will launch a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solidra.
Soliddal allows users to choose where they want to store their data and who can access the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “the acquisition of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
With Solid technology, the application allows people to create their own "personal online database", i.e. POD.
This can include lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
The personal online data warehouse is unique in that the user can fully decide who can access your data.
The company calls this “the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data”.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company’s mission is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, the world’s technology developers will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not asking Facebook and Google to take the technology that is bringing about complete change, which would put the business models of companies at the top of their heads from one day to the next.
“We don’t ask for permission from them.”
Berners-Lee said in a statement on Saturday that Inrupt’s mission is “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the University of Massachusetts.
Berners-Lee has taken part as an important thinker in recent months in debates on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I’m finally optimistic about the next era of the global network,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann, a priest of the First World War, is celebrated
The only English bishop to receive the Victoria Cross was his hometown 100 years after he carried out his heroism in the First World War.
Bernard Vann, Honorary and Distinguished Architect, was awarded the Medal of Honor in the Battle of Belenglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper was killed, so he could never know that he deserved the highest honour of the British Armed Forces.
The commemorative monument was unveiled by two grandsons at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolic” that the monument was handed over after exactly 100 years of honoring his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Honourable Bernard Vann carried his flag across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "in the midst of a dense fog and a fierce fire of cannon and machine-guns."
He later stepped into the line of sight, and with "exceptional heroism" stood at the top of the flag, then on his own drove a camp-fired detachment, without injuring three of its members.
On October 4, 1918, Bernard Vann was shot and killed by a German sniper, just one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach out to what my grandfather did, and it taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72, of his grandfather.
After a concert by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also commemorated.
Michael Vann said he felt honored that he could have played a role in the celebration, and then added: “A true hero’s victory is attested by how many will express their respect later on.”
MMA fans streamed all night to watch Bellator 206 stream, instead of receiving Peppa malaco
Imagine you've been up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206, and you'll miss the broadcast.
The San José show featured 13 crashes, six of which were broadcast live as part of the main competition show at night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight against each other, the English viewers were not surprised by Peppa Pig instead of the match.
This has been made difficult by many who have stayed up until the early hours of the morning due to the collision.
Instead of the MMA game, a children’s cartoon was dubbed “some kind of sick joke” by one of the fans on Twitter.
“According to state regulations, this kind of content can no longer be transmitted by the channel at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of communications and marketing.
“Yes, it is Peppa, the idea of the dragon.”
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, has promised to revise the schedule of the show in the future to take into account the UK audience as well.
“I think we can solve it again and again,” Coker said.
“However, since there is a 6 a.m. on Sunday, our time is up to Sunday, which is already Monday, we cannot cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when you switched on the show, a lot of messages arrived, and so most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of the six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we would have liked to make the audience happy, but we counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's Minority Complex for his Sexual Attitude
Tom Daley stated at the Olympic Games that at a young age he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but he took the motivation out of it to be successful.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is” like him.
On Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told broadcasters she stands up for gay rights to give others “hope.”
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of the show, has been missing for several months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, inviting Daley as a “boat wrecker,” he said he felt “less” than anyone else at a young age because he “was socially unacceptable if someone loved boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, the sense of inferiority and the sense of otherness is one that gives me perseverance and strength to achieve my successes.”
He wanted to prove that he too deserves “something” so as not to cause disappointment to everyone when it comes to his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a well-known representative of the LMBT community and, taking advantage of her role in this year’s international games in Australia, urged world governments to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke up on the case because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly, without any negative consequences, and he would have liked to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised by the situation” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker whom he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and her 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year, and she said the age difference never meant a problem between them.
“If a man goes through so much at a young age,” he said – at the age of 14 he was in his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later – then he finds it difficult to find someone in his own age class who has experienced similar extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a young boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, according to Daley's own admission, completely turned his attitude towards the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win gold,” he said.
“But you know what I came up with? There are more important things than my Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child's name came from Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions he had was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit there in the front row.
“I couldn’t help but say, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I grabbed his hand when he stopped breathing, but until now I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt like this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (B<0xC3><0xBC>szke) helped him a lot in the preparation for the Olympics, and to this day, he's going to be lipophilic when he hears it.
The Desert Island Discs will start at 11:15 a.m. local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was knocked out at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he needs to win back his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain as an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson is playing for the 12th time in the two-year event, but due to his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-games, Team Captain Jim Furyk has sent him to the pitch.
Instead of the five players who collected wins in the big competitions being the focus of the events, as many times when the United States had to fight for victory, now in one half of the day the team is squirming, the other half is playing on the pitch, and the other half is squirming on the pitch.
At the height of his career, he has never been one of the most accurate batsmen, so the 48-year-old is not really on the narrow course of Le Golf National, where he has to pay a very high price for the wrong shots due to the high grass.
And if the course itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face English champions Francesco Molinari in the ninth game of Sunday, who won all four games this week in the starting line-up with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans starting with a four-point deficit before the 12 individual matches start strong, Mickelson’s match can be crucial.
Furyk claims he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in the development of the day, he has forced my back, beaten me, and promised that he will be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
- He's very confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and the past week.
I didn’t really want two games for him.
I planned more, but in that situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
With Mickelson's Sunday performance, Nick Faldo will break the record for more games than anyone has ever played in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series on the Ryder Cup, which is far removed from the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson may have 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven indecisive ones, but Furyk pointed out that the veteran player’s presence does not have tangible benefits for the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the games they played against him, and it’s good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the game in the strictest sense."
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn his back on his luck.
The Danish player made his first appearance in a 1997 Valderramai match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros scored a five-point lead against the Americans, and in the end only managed to maintain a one-point lead with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 lead.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we missed out on a big advantage in Valderram, yet we only won with one hairstyle, and we also had a big advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who is in the picture, at the 5th and 3rd Friday of the 2018 class.
“We’re thinking about the races of the previous years, and everyone can already see that the game isn’t over yet.
You'll have to play full power play tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the table.
We have our goal, which is nothing more than to win this trophy, and now all we have to do is focus on that.
As I said before, I’m mostly dealing with the 12 players on our team, but we have to pay attention to the other side, who are historically one of the biggest players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, proud of the team’s performance on the hard track, added: “I would never forgive the forecasts in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different cake.
Then everything depends on the individual performance, which is completely different from the team game.
It’s a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out individually, you’ll find out from every angle what kind of golfer you really are.
This should be understood by players to bring out the best in themselves on the pitch tomorrow.
They have to break away from their partner, who will also have to bring in the best form.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, Jim Fury, the captain of the opponent’s team, is very confident that his players will perform better individually than in a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of the four.
Furyk has personally experienced both sides of the last day’s uprisings: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, then he stood on the losing side after the European team’s bravourous performance as a “Medinah miracle”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked, “because he encouraged the players before the last day of the game, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.”
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re starting as fast as we can in Brookline, as we’ve seen in Medinah.
If one of the teams really intervenes, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent’s players during the middle games.
“We’ve put the order together accordingly, and we’ve prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the effort to reverse the position, and Rory McIlroy played in the first match, then in the row Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter followed as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided on the order because I think that’s how the picture is made from the beginning to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added.
The surrender of Germany's newest warship has been postponed again.
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for at least next year.
The flag carrier of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, the "Rheinland-Palatinate", was delayed for the first half of 2019, the daily Die Zeit wrote, quoting one of the army's spokesman.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy's lineup in 2014, but the ongoing delays have made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships to replace the Brema-class aging frigates.
We know that it will be equipped with a large firearm, as well as various anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and cloaking technology, including a signal booster that reduces the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it is less likely to require maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the ongoing slide in the project, it may happen that these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power at sea, will become obsolete when they are finally put to service, Die Zeit noted.
Last year, the heavy-duty F125 frigate came to the headline, when the German Navy officially refused to abandon the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent a landing ship back to the manufacturer.
There is not much information about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentions several critical "software and hardware errors" that render the warship unusable in a combat deployment.
Software shortages are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, which is only half of the crew of the old Brema class frigates.
It also came to light that the ship is extremely heavy, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to implement further modifications later on.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as the German-made ships of the same class that were ordered in World War II.
Apart from the faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion), while the initial project was estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
In the light of the problems with new frigates, it is of particular importance that Germany’s maritime presence is being repressed, according to the warnings.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament's National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the navy "is beginning to get rid of the intrusive warships".
According to the official, the problem has become a daunting process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the hulls.
He expressed concern that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the Navy's line.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of dinosaurs
New research is being carried out on a Scottish-terrestrial estate, which aims to find out how to exploit the characteristics of the landscape by the testers during hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will lead to new information about the behavior of single-flying mammals, which can also be used for future species conservation initiatives.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behavior of common and soprano dwarf names, as well as brown long-tailed denims and water denims in the Inverewe Garden area of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at the appropriate points in the area, so that during the season the activities of the testers can be fixed.
The NHS staff and volunteers will carry out mobile data collection with hand-held detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound content of the recordings can be used to determine the frequency of the test sounds, as well as what species they are doing.
The researchers also prepare a habitat map and report, which can be used to determine in detail how the behavior of animals develops depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for the test subjects and how they are used.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management jobs, such as the formation of sedges, and how best to preserve forested areas for the testes and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of dengue populations has decreased significantly over the past century.
Buildings and field development work will disrupt the sleeping places of animals and reduce their lives. . . .
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are the airborne papers, certain chemical procedures used for building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
In fact, the testers are not completely blind.
However, because of their nocturnal predators, they rely much more on hearing when hunting for prey than on sight.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasonic reconversion, they can determine the exact position of insects, as well as the location of the terrain objects entering their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of the test areas very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and dormitory examinations, and also occasionally take part in rescue work.
The organisation has established Scotland’s first and only dedicated reservoir of mercury on the Thrave straits in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten mercury species.
According to property manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for testers.
“There’s a great place in Threave for testers,” he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good life.
But we don’t know much about the testers yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to make you feel great.”
He also pointed out how important it is to make sure that there are novices living there before the renovation of the buildings, as the destruction of a single plant can result in the destruction of 400 women and young people alone, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The law prohibits the slaughter of animals protected by the testes, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for help from the population.
“There is still a lot we don’t know about the testes, and we have almost no information about the situation of most of the domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of gender-based violence, lawyers sue against German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has dubbed the allegations of sexual violence against him as “fake news”. In his opinion, others want to use his name to “get in the public consciousness”.
The footballer's lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against a German weekly newspaper called Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese frame and the Juventus gang have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, announced in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the charges surfaced with 142 million fans that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
“What I’ve been told today is a lie,” the five-time gold player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public eye.
It's like that.
They want to become famous by my name, that's the life of the public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added in a smile.
Because of the allegations, which have been dubbed “an unacceptable, life-threatening suspicion,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages “to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in one of the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man sexually assaulted a woman, in documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent good boy", excluding "one percent."
Based on the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but said that all this was done with common consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and made a vision of his injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an agreement outside the courthouse because he was "feared of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to put the deal out of effect, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life worse.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was just ahead of a transfer (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will treat' the loss of car factories 'forever'
The UK will be "forever sorry" if it loses its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Entrepreneur Greg Clark said.
He then added that Toyota UK considers its statement to the BBC “aggressor” that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the carmaker will be forced to temporarily stop production at a coal mine near Derby.
“There’s a problem with the agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, jobs could be cut off due to delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Last year, Toyota Auris and Avensis produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
“I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at the plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director, Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its oxford plant, which produces Minik, for one month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risk of risks arising from the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant operates on a "timely" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions at the borders could lead, according to industry representatives, to production delays and parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, so production should be discontinued.
Clark said that theresa May Chequers, known as Theresa May Chequers, has "precisely put together a plan for future relations with the EU to avoid late checks at the border."
“We have an urgency to reach an agreement, and we want to reach an agreement on the best possible terms that will not only help us enjoy the fruits of our current successes, but also offer new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain at the moment.”
Toyota was unable to tell how long production would last, but warned that the cost-sharing could disrupt the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently working as a representative of the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, we will never get back the jobs that end at such a time.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have developed a precise and achievable plan for the future EU relations, and we are working on it.”
Trump and Rosenstein meet could be postponed again, the White House says
“You may be delayed for another week,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump’s large-scale meeting, as the debate around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence on the election, the relationship between Trump’s advisers and the Russian government, as well as the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
In Washington, they have been finding out for months whether Trump will finally manage the deputy chief of staff, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
According to a New York Times report this month, Rosenstein stressed that he was introverted to the meeting in order to record the conversation with the president, and the question also raised whether there would be a possibility of replacing Trump on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the defendants.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and that speech went to present his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who had appeared in front of the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he was "unlikely" to run away from Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and his sex offender, one of the witnesses, Christine, were also a witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-time FBI press conference to investigate charges brought against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, paid a visit to the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We have not yet a date set, we can postpone this week, but in the light of the cases at the Supreme Court, I see some chance of another one-off delay.
Soon it will be revealed, and I, as always, will inform the press."
Some journalists, however, doubted the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the show's host, also asked about this cause.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the press reporters was not the cause of the TV reporters' perceived disregard for the behavior of a "sensation shark," but added: "I don't dispute the fact that I'm really a sensational shark."
He then pointed out that there will be more direct meetings between Trump and representatives of the press.
"The president gives interviews with more question-and-answers than any previous president," he said, adding that he did not support the statement: "We looked at the numbers."
Press reporters will continue to be, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States his questions, the light years are better than if they were talking to me.
“We often try to sort this out, and in the last few weeks there have been many such occasions, so instead of White House press reporters, they can speak personally with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers reporters’ questions when he leaves the White House, or attends public events, or perhaps press conferences, with visiting dignitaries.
However, the press conferences held on their own are quite rare.
Why, it may be possible to conclude from what happened this week, when the President produced a bizarre and uncanny role as an outcast in New York City in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health board has sent a letter to NHS Scotland’s European Union workers over concerns about Brexit.
In a letter, the head of the health club expressed his gratitude to the Scottish NHS for its employees from the countries of the European Union, and stressed that he hopes they will remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected departure of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs incurred by EU citizens working in a decentralised public service in relation to their applications for legal status.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on leaving have continued, as a result of which a decision is expected to be made in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also agreed to prepare a possible script without any agreement.
I am aware of what a calming period this may be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.
Employees from different EU Member States and from other countries, with valuable experience and expertise, are helping the work of the healthcare team, which also has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home, and we would very much like you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency operation after a 31–27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Chief Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time, according to the Associated Press.
“He walked off to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and members of the health staff first gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field, then put on a stretcher, and took him to further examinations.
One Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he "for now knows no further details about the type and extent of the injury," while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-long freshman, spends his first season in the Tennessee State team, where he qualified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he showed a total of five successful fixtures before leaving the track, so he’s already 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher interest rate on properties purchased in the United Kingdom.
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher interest on properties purchased in the UK, and with the resulting surplus income, they would support the homeless.
With this step, I would neutralise Corbyn’s success among young voters.
The purpose of the bill is for those who are not taxed in the UK.
According to the calculations of the State Treasury, this would amount to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in annual revenue, which would be converted into support for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher interest on properties purchased in the UK, and the resulting surplus income will be translated into support for the homeless, Theresa May is about to be announced in a press release today.
The aim of the move is likely to be to counteract the successes achieved by Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he understands by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in liability will affect individuals and companies that are not taxed in the UK, and the resulting surplus income will be turned into a fight against unemployment.
The additional fee added to the current entitlement, which may be calculated in excess of the higher entitlements paid to second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issue two years ago, may reach up to three per cent.
The State Treasury accounts for <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in annual revenue following the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK citizens, leading to a significant price increase, as a result of which the situation of first home buyers becomes increasingly difficult.
Many of the country's wealthy neighborhoods have become "wind towns", especially in the capital, as many are foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the responsibilities that could help young people who were preparing to wait for their first homes.
He personally considers the construction companies to be responsible for keeping property prices high, which has become a habit of buying up and leaving the premises on parlagon. He asked May to delete the quotas issued to affordable houses and start selling something in the country.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for housing reforms, including the abolition of housing controls and roadblocks without basic barriers.
In addition, it would provide more jurisdictions and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that my Prime Minister would like to dedicate myself to the restoration of the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
For this, the real estate market situation needs to be arranged.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and establish a family here.
However, it is not right that private individuals living outside the country, as well as companies of foreign interest, should be able to buy real estate just as easily as the hard-working British citizens.
Dreams drawn from their own homes have become almost inaccessible to many, and the state of immigration has become inaccessible to many.”
Jack Ross: 'I want to be the manager of the Scottish team'
According to Sunderland coach Jack Ross, his “principal wish” is to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the first-class league, with only three points left from the first-place finish.
He then transferred his seat to the stadium named Stadium of Light, after the previous season's St. Mirren team was successfully relegated to the first-class Scottish football championship.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserves,” Ross told the BBC Sportsound show in Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always drew back to them.
But now I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
Among Ross's predecessors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach is not thrilled that he has to step into the ranks of such big names and has previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I’m measuring success right now to see if I can get the team back in first class.
“If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the place in the first-class league,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I will only be able to see my activities here if I can get the club back.”
Ross' managerial career began just three years ago, after working as a substitute coach for the Dumbarton team and spending 15 months in the Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aolla stand up after the team returned to the third division, and with St. Mirren on the edge of the knockout the following season won the title of champion.
According to Ross, he feels much more confident now than he has ever been in his playing career, whether it’s Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real defining moment,” he said of his time as Alloa’s coach.
“Clearly, I thought management was more important to me than being a player.
It sounds strange, because I did well, and I had quite a good life out of it, and in fact, I had some really memorable moments.
The lives of the players, however, are sometimes very hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve gotten used to it, I feel the best in my skin as an adult.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Radio Scotland on Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00, according to local time.
According to a study, beer falls best at 5:30 on Saturday afternoon
In the summer heatwave, the traffic of English pubs in a difficult situation has increased significantly, but there is still a lot of pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to the data collected, the consumption of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business advisory firm that compiles the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny season and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup performance, the trend of the previous month’s average of 2.8% would have continued in July, when the average pubic acid level was lower than expected.
The decline in restaurant revenue of 1.8% in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell alcohol were the best served, which produced a larger increase than even the drop in restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also adversely affected by the prolonged sunshine, although not nearly as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people prefer to drink at a time like this.
The revenue from pubs and bars operated by the companies increased by 6.6% this month, and the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality industry RSM analyst, said: “These results follow a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Furthermore, the weather, as well as the more significant social and sporting events, are considered to be the main revenue factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains are in a difficult position, and the 4.8% annual decline in revenue can be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
It could not have been worse for the long, hot summer for the restaurant operators, and it will only be in time that the milder weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
The total growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK’s hospitality industry (for pubs, bars and restaurants), is a widely accepted industrial scale meter with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and a total capacity of 47 members.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children (up to 11 years old) have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-sides" is increasing
The fear of sharing sexual content is growing in the wake of the news
20% of students said they had a “head” account that their parents could see.
One in five children (up to the age of 11) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta-Alfios” is growing rapidly, which refers to Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
Following the news, there is a growing fear of sharing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students responded that they have an unscrupulous “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally appeared on the cover of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage profile that said she wanted to “rape her.”
According to a survey conducted by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) representing the directors of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of the 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% of them have private accounts.
“I find it exhausting that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said Mike Buchanan, HMC’s head of education.
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ in the Scottish Athletics Association
Eildh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and the board’s chairman, Ian Beattie, said the sport’s decision-makers would be invaluable to the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in Scotland, the UK and the international athletics community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said, “I’m happy to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really help the work of the Scottish athletes.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals, which are regularly claimed by the BBC as experts, were won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 metres and 400 metres, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain disturbance.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's going to take some time to figure out if I'm going to recover at all.
Mant trying to work, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I am going to agility training!
Thank you for the encouraging message!”
Breast-sucking ad similar to mothers' cows shares online community
Heves has sparked an online debate about the advertising of a breast-feeding company that compared breastfeeding mothers to head lice.
According to Elvie, she developed “the world’s first quiet, portable breast pump” and advertised their product in an ironic ad that evoked music videos that showed what freedom the device gives to mothers who cover their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of salmon, while in the background you can hear the lyrics that draw up the following lines: "Yes, I understand myself, I don't even have a wolf" and "if it hadn't appeared, they wouldn't have died, but my breasts."
And the chorus says, "I'm pumping, I'm pumping, the kid's eating big, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm cutting the girls."
The ad posted on the company’s Facebook page soon came across online discussions.
The video has reached 77,000 views, and hundreds of mixed acceptance comments have come to it. Many believe that advertising sparks a joke from the “wrong” of the dairy industry.
“It is very unpleasant to advertise the product with fakes.
Similarly, their bodies produce milk only when they give life to their offspring, but their beers will be removed from them within days,” one of the adverbs said.
The Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: “Yes, it’s terrible for motherhood and wine, too.
But why don't we use them to give breast-feeding to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: “Totally insensitive advertising.”
Others rose to the defense of the ad, a woman admitted that the video was "extremely funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd have bought it right away if I could still suck.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy ad, so I'm not trying to get into it anymore.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another added: “It’s a funny ad for mothers in their workplace or in a nursing home who feel like they’re ‘wealthy’ because of it.
It is not the dairy market that praises or condemns.”
At the end of the video, the women show that throughout the dance, there was a discreet bra in their bra.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women who use breast-feeding sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding container, so women can move freely, hold their child in their hands, or even move out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump was a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the parallel between the women in their milk and the head lice, to the fact that the use of suckers is met with what challenges they face, and to make it funny to see how our sucker provides a sense of freedom in this regard."
Elvie's breast pump wasn't the first time she'd been in the news.
On London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother, Marta Jakubowski, stepped on the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child migrants held in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can partly be explained by the fact that the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and measures so far make it harder to find host homes.
Typically, the recipients themselves are illegal immigrants, and they are considered to be ruining their chances of staying in the country if they apply for admission to the children.
This threat continued to grow in June, when it was announced that parents applying to the host and adults living with them in a household should be given a fingerprint, and this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Immigration and Customs) official, said in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested and reported missing without their escorts.
The office later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had an innocent history of life in prison.
“80% of the applicants for admission and those living with them in a household are illegally staying in the country, and a significant part of them are convicted criminals.
That’s why we continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to expedite the procedure involving children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear before the court within one month of being taken into custody, rather than 60 days, according to social workers.
Many people apply to the court through videoconference instead of a personal appearance in order to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and those working in the system have reported that the longer they remain in custody, the more nervous and depressed the children will be, and the chances of violent outbursts or failed attempts will increase.
According to law enforcement officials, these risks are only increased by a larger facility, similar to a screwdriver, where due to the number of children, it is more difficult to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they do not provide enough time for the children to prepare or say goodbye to friends before moving them to such an establishment, they will be exposed to even greater trauma.
Syria has called for an immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish “invading forces”
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the UN General Assembly, called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the country’s eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who is also serving as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops had illegally entered Syrian territory, referring to the fight against terrorism, and “they will treat them in this way.”
“They have to leave immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria “is coming to an end soon,” where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus was "going a holy fight to clear the entire territory of Syria" from terrorist groups and "from the illegal foreign presence."
The 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisors to the Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions for their return were appropriate, and only "one Western country" was repressed with "irrational fears", dismissing the refugees from their return.
“We have reached out to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help bring the population home,” he said.
“They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to the end of the war.
According to U.N. diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create a conflict zone for the last major uprising, around Idlib, could help further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish alliance has prevented the Russian-backed Syrian government from launching a large-scale attack on the territory of three million people.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement sets “clear deadlines” and indicated his hope that the military actions will only be directed against jihadists, including the al-Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, and which will be “rooted.”
Staffan de Mistura, UN Ambassador, hopes that a committee consisting of representatives of the government and the opposition will soon be convened, tasked with preparing the post-war Syrian constitution and preparing the elections.
Among the terms and conditions of Moualem, the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, for example, only "review of certain articles of the current constitution", is considered acceptable, and in view of the intervention of all external actors in the process.
That's why they're going to re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberals come true, and a process of accountability or a time of turmoil does not put an end to his presidency.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all time.”
For now, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN’s mainstream viewership has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its viewership to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main show, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show, which runs on MSNBC, is the most-watched cable show with a total audience of 3.5 million.
“It attracts us like fire because we don’t understand something,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Chosen Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the chair of the president’s office after he leaves.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian, is credited with writing "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club."
Here’s how to quote a Boston taxi driver before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" asked Scovell.
“He laughed,” the driver replied.
This is the fun part of chaos.
Of course, contrary to the television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to the Roe vs. Wade precedent in order to reunite immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do so that you do not worry about these facts.
However, it’s no longer part of the responsible information when you’re watching a six-hour talk show about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations in Bob Woodward’s book “F<0xC3><0xB6>relem” or about the death of Paul Manafort’s 15 thousand-year-old brother, the killer of Post.
What suited me, from now on, this will always come to mind about Super Mario.
“It feels a little bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of ‘Stars of the Galaxy’. He’s constantly changing and changing on Trump’s show.
If you miss one piece, you'll be gone right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time for Kauain, yet he was peeing inside his house watching MSNBC while recording the CNN show.
He could not break away from television as Brett Kavanaugh began his hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he himself was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were just kidding, but it seems like they were right.”

Both parties are throwing money into the toughest contests in the midterm congressional elections.
No one was surprised that in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, both parties are spending the money countlessly after two active representatives fight for the same seat after the congressional districts have been redeployed.
One of the contenders for the newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is Democratic Conor Lamb, who won a term in a midterm election last spring.
Opponent of Lamb, Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12 electoral districts, which shows significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district boundaries had been manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties’ funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), bid for almost each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after he won a close race in the mid-March election in the Pennsylvania 18th congressional district, which drew a lot of attention.
For more than a decade, the seat was Republican, with Donald Trump winning the district with 20 points.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning the election.
U.S. Considered Sanctions Against El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Stopped the Plan
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington had barely responded to.
Donald Trump negotiated with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization’s leadership team out of there.
The U.S. Department of State has called back senior U.S. envoys from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "due to their recent decision not to support Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the ministry.
Sanctions, however, were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial aid and the targeted visa restrictions, would have affected the Central American country, where the rate of unemployment and murder is also extremely high.
As the closed-door meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a conference on high-level, security and economic issues that would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year, and that was the primary goal of the summit.
In mid-September, the administration’s high-level representatives made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they do not want to punish El Salvador.
At a conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence also spoke, which diplomats say is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue any sentencing statements and did not take any criminal action.
White House spokesman John Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
Their accounts were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only anonymously willing to speak up.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates whether Trump has somehow obstructed the justice system....but the fact that it has been made public is indicative of this fact.
Mueller’s investigation is also alleged to have expanded on whether Trump’s team cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the election.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who, after the voters, may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump’s failure is far from inevitable... and his European friends are not.
Serious decisions have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how far the fight will go.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to crush Hitler, only waiting for the West to stand by the Czechs in Munich.
The aid was missing, so it was not able to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
At similar historical turning points, the inevitable development of democracy is either accelerating or slowing down. . . .
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been hanging out since last year, when, as our newspaper reported on it, he suggested that they record conversations with the president, and suggested that Trump fill an inappropriate office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is deemed to be complete or incomplete, and despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge, he is appointed a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question: are we voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy looks forward to the long winter.
I am confident that this will not happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once housed the embassy.
My mother survived the Holocaust, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on the table bearing the sign of swastika on the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be a pessimist about our future?”

Graham Dorrans at Rangers confident ahead of Rapid Wien match
The Rangers will take on Rapid Wient on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against Spanish Villarreal will allow them to take part in the Europa League Group G.
The midfielder, Graham Dorrans, was unable to make his debut in the season 2–2 against Villarreal, but he feels that by building on this result, the Rangers can set themselves bolder goals.
“It was a great team against Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old.
“We believed we were able to score points and we brought a point.
Maybe we could have scored one more goal in the end, but we can't complain about the indecisive.
They were better in the first half, and we were connected to them in the second half.
There will be another important European match on Thursday.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they've been good enough in their previous game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was a tough year, I found myself, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the exercises are going well.
I hope that if we put everything in, we can leave behind the previous season and achieve good results.”
A lot of women are worried about not saving enough for their age.
The survey participants had accurate ideas about the age of care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of respondents and their spouse discussed the expected costs of their elderly care.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked about it with their children.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they’re not used to it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take proper care of you if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with their advisor and family, they will choose where and what kind of care they wish to provide; these decisions will have a significant impact on subsequent costs.
Bring in a financial advisor: he or she can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Funding can be done with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care, or with life insurance combined with a hybrid savings, which can cover expenses, or use your own assets as a cover... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: This allows you to cut out the possibility of subsequent courtship in advance.
Trust a representative, a trustworthy person who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care, and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with your financial institution as well.
This reliable person makes the necessary financial decisions and takes care of paying the bills when you are unable to do so.
Also, don’t forget the little details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medicine and allergies?
Please record this information in writing so that it is available at any time.
“It’s not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who the doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”

Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
They lost their lives in at least 384 when a major earthquake hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and then a source said the death toll could continue to rise.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so there was no news from the Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Celebes:
Palu, the capital of Central Celebes Province, was built on the west coast of the island of Celebes, at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
It was the 40th anniversary of the city’s founding when the earthquake and the fountain were renewed.
The Donggala Governorate is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the governorate – a region smaller than the province – was about 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is mainly characterized by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the outskirts of Celebes.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Relief Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by a source several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a fountain with more than 200 inhabitants was completed and hundreds of houses were destroyed in Donggala.
In 1996, a spring year was reached in West Donggala, and nine people died.
Indonesia lies in the region of the Earthly active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and eruptions of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea battle broke out on the western coast of the North Sumatra province of Aceh, which launched a source ship reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, killing more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong waves rocked the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and the trailing sourceland claimed nearly 700 victims on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake destroyed Padang, near the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of the Mentawai Island group near Sumatra, and caused about 10 meters of wells that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: Overseering reached the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and destruction that ensued reminded many of the memories of the terrible spring of 2004.
Sources were not created this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a high-powered row here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the earth, and thousands of tourists have been stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential son were arrested on charges of bodily harm.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, the Alaskan state police said.
According to the police report, when a maid wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took the woman's phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison in pre-trial detention, a $500 bail has been issued for him, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, and when asked about his crime, he replied that he was "not guilty at all".
Palin's three defendants are charged with a class A felony, i.e. up to four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, they are also charged with a Class B violation, which could result in a one-day closure and a fine of $2,000.
Palin is not first to be confused with the law.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veterans’ Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and the obstruction of criminal reporting, as well as with armed robbery under the influence of alcohol, in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed to have hit him on the man's face.
Sarah Palint also criticized several veterans’ organizations in 2016 when her son’s behavior was attributed to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi ministry.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Earthquake and Flood in Indonesia, Hundreds of Victims
They lost their lives in at least 384 after a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a flood that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, from the Indonesian capital, to the north of Jakarta.
Several videos have been posted on social media about the arrival of the spring season.
On the coast of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at a celebration, when the source price reached the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Ask for Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipovra, the suspect in a terrorist attack that claimed eight lives in New York City, who has not been executed in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was charged in October with driving a rented truck from the Home Depot on a bicycle on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, gassing several pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intentionally" caused injury, according to the New York Southern District Attorney's Office's filing.
According to the file submitted, proof of either of the two charges can justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was charged with 22 crimes, including an eight-year-old manslaughter, which had been used almost exclusively against organized crime, as well as the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack "required significant planning and preconceived intent," prosecutors say, and Saipov said he carried out the attack in a "serious, cruel, inhumane" manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco’s family.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has been seeking a death penalty for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In the New York federal case, a death sentence was finalized in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were convicted two years earlier, for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in a powerhouse on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, said the court documents did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the hearings, he stated that he was happy to do so.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos he had seen on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, he is accused.
According to the police, he asked them to put out an ISIS flag in the hospital room.
In all 22 indictments, he confessed to being innocent.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipovo, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutors.
“In our opinion, the actual loss of liberty of life for the confessional would have been more favorable, the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all those involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for the defendants.
A Tory representative says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage said in a speech at the Tory Conference that he "calls the army of the people to fight".
According to Ukip’s former leader, politicians need to feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May’s partners suggested that Farage should rely on negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who is not an official, told a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have "already left" if Farage was the Brexit minister.
It is well-characterized by the pressure within Mayre’s hard-fought party that the remaining party Toryk was speaking at another anti-Brexit rally in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which calls for a permanent rift between the Brexit and the remaining parties, as well as between the EU.
Despite the negative reactions, his allies said he was trying to reach an agreement with Brussels to allow Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose only from its package or the “full chaos”.
Bone, in a demonstration at Leave Means Leave in Solihull (“The exit means we’re leaving”), said that the “Chequers-alku” must be counted down.
He suggested that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have left,” he said.
A representative from Wellingborough added: “I am waiting for Brexit, but the Chequers will have to be counted down.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be the servants of others.
We want to bring the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the mood has changed: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, the representative of the Brexit party Tory, also attended the meeting and told reporters: “All I ask is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers bill rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially among activists who work in the field and helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
May added: “Only the Prime Minister can hold the chair that keeps his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians “must feel the pressure” not to dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now the bet,” he said.
“They want to sell Brexit, and today we’ve come together to fight, not let it win.”
With these words, he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are calling on the people’s army to fight for victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
The remaining parties, meanwhile, marched up in Birmingham and held a two-day meeting in the city centre.
Some activists, who formed the "Tory against Brexit" movement this weekend, flew the flag of the movement.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis welcomed the Conservatives in the party’s application for the opening of the conference due to security flaws.
“These people have said that they have a computerized background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, a non-stop border crossing, and a free trade agreement with Ireland, without borders,” he added.
They're just talking sideways.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren ‘thinks hard’ to start for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she is seriously considering running for the presidency.
The Boston Globe reported on Saturday that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future at a West Massachusetts-based public forum.
Warren, who is scheduled to serve as Donald Trump’s regular judge, is set to run for re-election in November against the state’s Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
For some time now, there have been speculations that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was held as part of the 36th People’s Forum meeting with voters since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the presidency.
In response, Warren said the time had come for “women to play a role in Washington’s recovery of the misaligned government, including taking up the top position.”
Arrested Person Suspected of Shooting Sims Playing in LSU
The Louisiana Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a man who was suspected of being shot dead by a basketball player in LSU, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press briefing at 11 a.m. Eastern Party time.
Earlier, a video of Friday's shooting was posted and asked for help identifying the man who was undetected.
The 20-year-old Simst arrived near Southern University's campus early Friday morning in a fatal shooting.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shooting, which turned out to be fatal,” police captain Murphy J. Paul told media representatives on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde's friend intervened in defense when he shot Simpson.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was on the scene, had a gun with him, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge district police station.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games in the last season, scoring 10 as a starter, playing an average of 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came closer to the title of World Champion after winning the title against Sebastian Vettel thanks to his team-building efforts
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a big role in my race.
Bottas, starting from the pole position, started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble, as he defended his position in the first two rounds, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
At first, Vettel stood out in the boxing box and left Hamilton to succumb to the traffic behind the midfield, which he was supposed to prove decisive.
Mercedes stood out with a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of a close action in which the Ferrari driver, swerving, left the inner corner free after moving twice as a defense in the third lap.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rucksacks, and was already seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, as he did not change his tyres to get to the finish line quickly and beat Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen in the hope of fourth place.
In the end, he stood out in the boxing round of 44, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase his pace, so R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>ne became the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let go.
“The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, as the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accuses of sexual harassment of new Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavana.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony, which he did before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he merely noted, “the things that happen in the Senate prove that people are ‘stupid and disgusting.’
“What can happen, and that’s the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when they see anger when they see people angry, believing, hating and lying,” he said.
“When we look at the statements and the exclamations, they say, ‘Oh, well, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you all right?
Remember the answer... You leaked the document? – “Oh, oh, what is it?
Oh, no.
I didn’t sneeze.”
Well, let's stop for a second.
“We didn’t win, we didn’t win,” he said, citing the senator.
A letter detailing charges against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July, and the letter was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak had been his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“He asked me to treat him with confidence, and I treated him with confidence as he requested.”
However, it seems that the president did not accept the denial, who noted at a meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you what the situation is: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't sneeze, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee for the three women accused of sexual harassment, saying that Democrats are using the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They’ve decided to use any means, but they’re regaining power.
“They can see the credibility, the modesty, they don’t care who they’re hurting, they have to gas it out to gain power and control,” the president said.

Air traffic controller lost his life so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape from the crash.
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia, who lost his life while taking care of the safe boarding of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than eight hundred people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday, after which a source was attacked.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many have been forced under the rubble in the town of Palu.
However, despite saving the lives of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the wilds of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained there to safely board the flight of the Batik Air 6321, which was already on the runway.
Then he ran out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirai said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were pounding when we heard the news,” he added.
Authorities say the death toll could be as high as thousands, and the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong, according to the country's disaster management agency, is hard to come by.
“The number of victims is likely to continue to rise as many have been trapped in the rubble and many have failed to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palut, where mass burials are held on Sunday.
Catalytic and commercial air vehicles deliver assistance and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
There is very little clean water.
“The shops are all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors in the race over time, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work night and day to carry out evacuation-related tasks!
Are you ready?" CNN's announcement.
Indonesia has already been hit this year by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, in which more than fifty people have died.
Micronesian plane crash: According to Air Niugini, one person disappeared in a plane crash in the lagoon
In Micronesia, an airline operating a plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon, a man has reportedly disappeared, although it was previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successful in evacuating from the sinking plane.
According to an Air Niugini press release, according to the situation on Sunday afternoon, a male passenger cannot be counted.
According to the airline, it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to any further information relating to the passenger, such as questions concerning age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane took off its runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane had landed very low.
“It’s a pretty good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to swam through the water to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
According to him, the flight attendants panicked and cried, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, near-missile repair ships also helped rescue and transported people to the shore by inflatable boats before the plane sank 30 meters below the water's surface.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none have touched Air Niugini.
Analyst summarized the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor informed the defendant of the man's retrial, which is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, passed an hour-long certificate as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he had compiled his cell phone records using the data of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received several phone calls from a woman on the night of her death with Tellis Chambers, which contradicted the man’s previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers, when the man said it was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford made his confession on Saturday, during which he said he was not in the city that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis was said to have known Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
Based on mobile phone data, they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the woman's text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the court later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip hop trio has called for a negative attitude that embraces the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip-hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social issues.
They would like to go back to these roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is it black again?
New York’s Dad sued for firing a party after a ‘racist’ message
A New York dagger filed a lawsuit over his dismissal of a couple of disparaging distinctions, after a mistaken message sent to him by the mother complained that they had been able to use a “black dagger” again.
The couple deny that they are racists, and compare the lawsuit to “squeezing.”
The two-year-old’s mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her disappointment when in 2016 the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, saw on her first working day that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEEM, M<0xC3><0x81>R MEIN A FEW!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who had woken up after being shot, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing dagger, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more likely to be a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day job, then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now asking the party for compensation for the dismissal, and is asking for a compensation of $350 per day for the six-day period of internal work to which they were originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them to stop the march, it can’t be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The pair responded to allegations of racism that it was reasonable to discontinue Maurice's use because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust him after being injured.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t understand.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone who, even if by chance, was rude?
Your new-born?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, who is similar to "squeezing," his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
“Would you attack someone like that?
It’s not a good thing to do that,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process is taking place, the public opinion court has already quickly condemned the party on social media, damaging their behavior and their logic.
According to a recent letter, the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not be able to tie to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine ourselves in a place someone would read for the first time even before it was published.
It’s quite fun to have this information now that we know how huge Paddington’s success is.”
According to him, his father, who worked as a BBC operator before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy, would not have had it hard if his work had been rejected, and then added that the book’s publisher had been following his 60th anniversary of the book’s publication.
Paddington called him "a very important member of their family" and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t imagined at all,” he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a kid who takes something: we’re proud of it even if it’s not really ours.
I think Paddington's success could have been seen that way.
Although he created and emerged from his imagination, he has always attributed his success to Paddington’s merit.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
On their way down, they rushed with their daughter to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought vainly for their lives.
“Nad regularly called to tell her that she was in a very bad condition and that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad, in which he announced that my daughter would die in the next two minutes, and I have to thank him.
I said good-bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly lost and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait for it to end.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the others who did not care about the ordeal she had just been through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I shook my head and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
An Abilities Sheet for Women to Prevent Suicides on the Bridge
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, are working to prevent them from throwing their lives away from others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, with inspirational messages and helpline numbers, were able to land on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook, and the waitress was attracted to everyone.
“Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that a smile would throw up any place.”
However, before his death, he gave up his job because he was “in a very bad state.”
Tyler, who ended his life by taking care of himself, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that it would have a domino effect.”
Ms. David drew up the postcards for the purpose of “so that people will know that there are people who can be looked up and talked to them, even if it is just a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who for years lost her friend, Ms. Davies, Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, not long after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in our attitude.
He was completely under himself on Christmas Day: when the children opened their gifts, he did not look into their eyes, and so on.
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our hearts into little pieces.
But we have to continue the fight.”

The Future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI Begins its Investigation
“I thought that if he could achieve what he was asking for – a limited amount of time, a limited amount of investigation – maybe we could come to an agreement,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that the committee was “decided by the fall of pieces.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be recognized by the timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, it will be much harder for them to bring their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby at them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bushnak in the White House, and through it he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
In the Senate, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make a decision to bring Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of dissidents ‘decreased’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok cited data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said that in the last year there were 1,127 dissidents compared to 2011, when that number was 2706.
Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher penalties for human trafficking, were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not publicly comment on this information.
The majority of the North’s dissidents are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents are accepted by China as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and are often sent back by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, and the focus of their meeting was on the tense nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This June historic meeting came between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad lines on further cooperation with the non-nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the American people, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is unimaginable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' unfit for the Supreme Court
The House’s minority president, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I was also reluctant to think that if a woman behaved like this at any time, I would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested against the rumours that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in her teenage years.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice was shut when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and co-ordinated murder of character” by angry liberals for his defeat in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was unfit for the Supreme Court's work, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he ruled out himself with his statements and the behavior he witnessed against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was indicted when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable, in the event that he holds the post and the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just the Supreme Court, it’s not the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Court of Appeals in the capital.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about his possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided the questions that had been asked as to whether he would refute the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“There is no time for a hysterical, captured person to be among the members of the court and wait for us to repel the joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep it in their hands.
It’s a legitimate provocation, months and years of anger that has been gathering on the surface and can’t be released without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, do you?”
“I had a great help from a woman who worked in a leadership position somewhere,” he continued, “she told me that she was also crying in anger, but she developed a technique that, when she started crying in anger, she said to her talking partner, “You might think you’re crying, you know.
But I'm angry."
And then it just went on.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
In part, tears are seen as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories was from an early job, a man-dominated office, where I once began to cry in my angry impatience that an older woman in my neck—a cool manager I was always afraid of—had been dragged out into the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be satisfied because they've managed to break up."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congressional representative from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an affair outside of marriage in the name of Monkey Business, and as a result he got out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, found that there was no reason for him not to run for the presidency on his own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“Now there were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was wanted in the middle of their back.
Someone called him "White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder was left with the money collection, so she accepted that she would not enter the competition unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed to be lost.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“Did they think I’d get a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, his feelings for the people who supported him were so entrenched, as well as the money collection and the direct efforts of the voters against the system that made it difficult to achieve frustration and frustration.
“They could have believed I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said, as the press responded.
“They could have believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write to my grave?
"S<0xC3><0xAD>rt"?
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening sequence of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and as the battle has not yet come to an end, the break between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired his first warnings earlier this year by taxing China’s most important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new tariffs already affect $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has cut back tariffs on US products worth between five and ten percent of the last 60 billion dollars.
China has agreed to cut back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not shrink in the near future.
If you want to bring Washington into contempt, it would mean that you have to give in the envelope before the demands, but public outcry to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Hszi Chin-ping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing is doing well, the U.S. trade war pressure could well come to China in the long run, as it would reduce dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions in Washington, D.C., or Beijing, that could put any of the economies of the two countries into economic turmoil, would be far more serious than previously acknowledged by American observers,” said researcher Abigail Grace, a researcher at Security.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been lost in the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said that the country’s conditions are improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they had to flee between terrorism and the self-imposed economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome all assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he stressed that countries do not accept the conditional assistance or cooperation that has supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at the 16.5:10.5 Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has fallen on the European stage for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended the title as the Danish team captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who ran across the entire tower, threw his batting in the water at par-3 16th hole, handing it over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari glowed all around him, making him one of the 4 players who have ever achieved a 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth received 5&4 from the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
With eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of the tournament of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for having chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia, who is passionate about winning the European Cup, said.
Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 win on Sunday, will give the staph booty to Jon Rahm.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 titles and was preceded by only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team ran all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, after a disappointing result, said he was “proud of these guys because they fought.”
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down with your hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You also need to raise your hats.
The enemy was better than us.”
Red Data News: Concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are Decreasing

The extent of the red tide is about 130 miles of coastline, from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are patches of Hillsborough County, about 10 miles away, but compared to last week in a relatively smaller area.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration was reported in Pinellas County and along its coasts, low and high-temperature concentrations in Hillsborough County, high-value concentrations in Manatee County, high-value concentrations in the background, and Sarasota Bay.
There have also been reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory irritation from Northwest Florida.
