The period in which the Xe events took place was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The medieval phase of the Middle Ages came after the first phase of the High Middle Ages and followed from the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is the source of so many ideas, it gives technological impetus or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human development is guided by a basic logic together with the laws of science and its manifestation throughout technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share the idea: the development of technology itself follows a path that goes from cultural or political influence, and against technology to the "effects" of its societies that the inherent xé imports that it conditions socially.
For example, one might say that the engine of the car carries by force to the development of roads.
However, ‘a network of nasional roads is not economically viable alone by some machine, so there are new production methods that are being developed to reduce the cost of having a machine.
Having so many machines leads to so many accidents on its roads, and cost leads to the invention of nine medical techniques to cure the damaged bodies.
Romanticism gave a great impetus to cultural determinism treated by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and in time customs and cultures have emerged in that geography and these, being in harmony with society, have been arbitrarily imposed.

Agriculture of sustensa is a simple, often biological, system that saves semi-sovereign origin from the ecoregion combined with the rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most of the farmers are now engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.

It does not depend on a primate with a digestive system such as che<0xC5><0x82><0xC5><0x82>o to satisfy its need for amino acids rancrando<0xC5><0x82>i other available plant resources.
Moreover, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: depression of the crescent, malnutrition and finally death.
The plant's easily accessible resources include the proteins that were once there and the vegetables themselves had to be primates like other plants that were difficult to digest unless they were cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (forms, termites, ovi) not only provide the fascially digestible but also provide them with a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees do savannah.

The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between dots and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, he studied the flow of traffic and difficulties so that the behavior of the driver is not to be expected with complete certainty.
Fortunately, the driver tends to set within you a reasonably coherent limit; therefore, the traffic currents tend to be in a reasonable coherence and to be broadly represented in a mathematical way.
