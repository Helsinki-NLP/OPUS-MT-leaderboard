Professor admits he killed his girlfriend by calling 911.
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who is calling 911, said that he shot his police girlfriend with a gun and that the police should come home just a little trembling.
Lamb said his “loved dog” was alive and probably sad, and that the dead woman’s family’s phones could be found on the woman’s cell phone.
Police found a note at home that read with a handwritten note on Amy Prentiss' lifeless body and a white note: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could return everything, I loved Amy very much, and she was the only woman who loved me to this day."
There is no evidence that Lamb, who teaches two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has already taken 300 miles to the school campus where police-loved history professor Ethan Scmidt was shot and killed in front of Lamb's office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He also said that Lamb had made a terrible 911 call shortly after.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
One day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what caused Lamb to do so.
On both sides of the state, as well as investigating officers, as well as the details of the students and staff who knew him, he drew a picture of a talented but probably a troubled teacher.
The students said they were waiting for her to enter the class with four eyes.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that Lamb had no criminal and judicial records.
In a book he wrote, Schmidt spoke of Lamb as one of the "great people" he shared his academic life with.
They both took classes in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took classes from both.
However, there were also signs that there were spiritual problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke of Lamb’s praise, said he was also a worried and nervous person and seemed “like there was a problem.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he was drowning with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously stated that he had some health problems and wanted a sick leave from Delta State University.
This year I only taught two lessons on the internet.
The recent changes to the university's hiring policies did not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a member of staff teaching, despite the doctorate he worked hard to earn.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamb is obviously having some things in his mind".
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was cleared, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Attorney General Methel Johnson said his family committed suicide with a single 38-caliber weapon in the back yard of a house about 1.5 km from his home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, before Lamb was arrested.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
While it's not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the city's 3,500 student universities with a population of approximately 12,000 in 2009 and was teaching geography and education courses.
He received his doctorate in the field of education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun guy.
When Carla Hairston met through her friends, she said she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice person who tried to teach guitar for a few years.
At that time, he was the one who threw his heart out quickly.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, told Lamb, “When she came, all the girls were gone.”
Lamb and Prentiss have known each other for a while.
Lamb called 911 and said, "I killed my wife," but there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning living with them in the brick houses on the banks of a river in Gautier.
Police said the dog's condition was good.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they divorced 15 years ago, but that they have always been friends with Prentiss and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said his daughter was in complete disarray.
She and her mother were great friends.
He said he had never met O'Steen Lamb but heard that his daughter, Abigail, was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when they went on stage at a summer festival with Lamb and Abigail.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together at the general shows.
O'Steen said that his daughter wrote and said her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse working at various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a poor bar near Gautier, told The Julep Room that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after he finished playing the last few of Lamb's guitars and girls.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut off and throw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that the murdered Professor Schmidt ran a first-class seminar program and was an expert on the history of Native Americans and the colony.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also the president of a student advocacy group he founded.
On Tuesday night, nearly 900 people attended the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, including academics, university staff, students, and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt’s wife, Liz, and her brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the memorial ceremony, where the university choir sang “Star of the Dawn” and “The Magnificent Dawn.”
Classes continue on Wednesdays.
LaForge said, "We're trying to bring our students back."
The crisis is over.
It's time to wrap up the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to the news.
This text was corrected to indicate that the police were calling 911 after Lamb killed Schmidt, and to reflect this, despite Lamb's calling as "the wife" of Prentiss in the 911 call, that the couple was not formally married.
Toys R US plans to buy fewer holiday season items
Toys R Us announced that it will not hire as many holiday season members as it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said the company will recognize more work opportunities for existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people at stores and distribution centers across the country, which was 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be half-time.
The company said talks with candidates will begin this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are more months to the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees who will help them with the sale, shipping and distribution of products.
Michael J. Fox Reveals ‘Relationship’ with Princess Diana
“Back to the Future” was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
She explains this in the caption of the documentary Back in Time, which will enter the new vision: "We were waiting for members of the Royal Family sitting in the cinema hall to come and suddenly realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana was going to sit next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and a stretch away from me.
Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, a documentary about the film "Back in Time to the Future" includes interviews with director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
For the first time in 30 years, The Return to the Future came into being.
Spielberg said, “This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me.”
In addition to VOD and DVD formats, Back in Time will also be shown in some excellent movies.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Speaking about Russia’s growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Syrian problem, which has been going on for nearly five years, could not be solved “with military intervention” and that more weapons would only be more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together to find a political solution to the problem and hold constructive talks.
Ban said at his press conference on Wednesday that five permanent council members are planning to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and France at a meeting of the UN General Assembly to be held towards the end of the month.
He said he was deeply saddened that the split between members of the council and the Syrian people "has made the problem unsolvable" by the regional forces.
Ban invited five permanent members to join the Syrian crisis, just as he did in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Survey Figures That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label him as a firefighter.
The others seemed to be making fun of him.
And some support for internal explosions.
While some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in the polls, that hasn’t worked (yet).
The latest 11 national polls showed him Donald Trump’s leadership in double digits, and some are seriously starting to question the chance of a real estate emperor’s nomination.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump will be able to win the Republican nomination.
Experts say in 2011 that Rick Perry’s rise led to an increase for both Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process even in a single state.
And there are many reasons why there will be trouble in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the Growth Club, which is the economic conservative group, realize Trump’s enduring strength and begin to spend their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results that show that the real estate emperor just came and wasn’t temporary:
Trump’s preference rate has changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at the University of Monmouth just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view for the real estate emperor.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 people in the cabaca say they have negative views.
And these numbers are watching high in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Iowa in Quinnipiac showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters can be satisfied with Trump’s nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "shocked" or "happy" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 people said they would be "sad" if he got the nomination.
Only Ben Carson has the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they’ll be “amazing” for Trump, which is 40 percent).
The one closest to jealousy?
Only 21 percent of Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they “will not” or “will regret” if Jeb Bush, the organization’s favorite, is a candidate.
The majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s discretion as a problem.
While Donald Trump is being criticized for his demonstrative language and insults, on Monday, according to ABC News/Washington Post polls, 52% of Republicans polled believe that the real estate emperor has the right excuse to be president.
The same figure applies in Iowa, where the country’s first party body will be formed, and according to Quinnipac, 52% of Republicans think he will be the leader.
44 percent still think they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 people independently say their bias doesn’t fit the White House.
Republican voters are starting to get used to this idea.
When they put on the hats of political experts, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four out of every 10 people said Trump was the best.
A change from the end of July when four out of 10 people invested their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal globe of GOP voters was not very clear.
During the last round of elections, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be the candidate, with only 28% choosing Mitt Romney, who was ultimately the candidate.
The majority of GOP voters still seem to have found Trump’s election campaign to be insane.
Even if Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the dispersal area could also contribute to Trump’s rise, and it’s also a fact that anti-Trump support has been distributed among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll conducted at the beginning of September shows that in the event of a possible head-to-head match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump has received majority support every time.
Carly Fiorina, with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points.
With Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible head-on, Ben Carson passes the businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they make their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll, released on Tuesday, shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked down their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say that they won’t really change their mind.
46 percent of the candidates said they left the door open to change.
Trump’s biggest rival is brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Two months ago, in a campaign announcement speech, Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico a “rape” since he called them “rapeous” at the head and center of the 2016 conversation.
Some believe that Trump’s much-talked speech would drive important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and hurt their rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains on my agenda, Trump seems to be on my agenda.
The anger in the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are overwhelmingly taking half of the Republican vote because of their largely out-of-pocket situation.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of every 10 Republicans say they want someone from the outside rather than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry at Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were “unsatisfied” and 21 percent were “extremely angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn will be on the chair for the first time in the prime minister's question
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn has been eagerly awaiting his resignation in the Prime Minister's Questions Program.
Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the new Labour Party, will sit for the first time in the Prime Minister’s Questions after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance seems to be closely scrutinized by the media and the Labour Party.
In the weekly show, he called for “less theater and more reality.”
He also said that he could skip some sessions by leaving his colleagues behind.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn’s leadership, appointing the shadow cabinet and following his speech at the annual TUC congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party was also criticised by some Tory Nationalists for standing silent during the commemoration ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday, and was at the forefront of front-page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national march
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he stood in a "delighted silence" and praised "the Royal Air Force's heroism in the English War."
However, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend to the leader of the Workers' Party to say the national anthem as "independent" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
While refusing to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, about a dozen shadow ministers, due to differences in economy, defence, and foreign relations, less than one in six of those in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, said the political differences within the Labour Party had also begun to "combine" and that they were issues of the government's higher limit on aid to Mr Corbyn's position in the European Union.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had introduced new changes to completely lift the upper limit.
Hours later, Shadow Labor and Retirement Minister Mr. Smith said the party was opposed to lowering the government's upper limit of just <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000, and that it was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader to meet on the board of the defence chamber from the date David Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader promised a different approach to politics and said he had received “people-sourced” and more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North's Deputy Prime Minister said that the Questions program is very captivating and that the "response" will focus on the challenges faced by youth rather than poverty, inequality and youth.
Mr. Corbyn, when he was not himself, for example when Mr. Cameron went abroad, told the Prime Minister that he would represent Angela Eagle, the shadow trade minister, in the Questions program.
He even occasionally suggested the idea of other colleagues going to this chair, and told House Speaker John Bercow that he was going to address the issue.
In 2005, when he was a leader, Mr. Cameron often acknowledged that he wanted to move away from politics in the "Doll Game" style associated with the Prime Minister's Questions program, but a few years later he failed to do so.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a key measuring point for leaders' decision-making skills, to measure positions between the authorities in the House of Commons and the Nationalists; some critics have attributed it to the caricatures and the highly comprehensive reform.
'Caught in Joburg': Homeless young people are taking photography training
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place for the homeless.
But a group of old street kids have found a way to gain new talent and make their way through it.
I moved to Joburg, a studio where homeless young people took a picture of their neighborhoods and taught them how to make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Increase in UK Salary Increases <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Following data showing that fees in the UK have risen rapidly, the FTSE 100 index has also risen following the purchase offer made for SABMiller.
Excluding premiums in the United Kingdom recorded a 2.9% increase from the same period of the previous year between May and July.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rate increases.
Sterling rose by more than 1% against the US dollar to $1,5505, while against the euro by 0.84% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose by 1.49 percent to 6,229.21 points.
The company that is most notable for this rise has been SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase in its bid to buy attractive products from its rival EU InBev.
This offer will bring together the two largest beer companies in the world and well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9% with the impact of positive profit news from rival luxury marketing group Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures also showed that sales in China, as well as one of the key markets for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
The shares of the mining giant Glencore rose by 5% after it announced that it had raised $2.5 billion from the company’s estimated share sales under its debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s shares in the packaging and paper group were among the highest-value losing stocks after Goldman Sachs dropped its proposal for the company to “Sat” with a loss of 4.3 percent.
JD Sports’ share increased by <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million after the company’s six-month pre-tax profit rose by 83% to <0xC2><0xA3>3.1 million.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt his boss
Peter Cowgill, chairman of the JD Sports Board of Directors, said that having a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power on the pockets of potential consumers."
But this spending power, he said, could not exceed the high working costs of his company.
He added that the expenses will affect JD Sports’ expansion plans and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launched a public campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market collector Metcash has launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
As they prepare to open the first of their two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets will be strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers, and the Adelaide fair will be held at the fair and main.
IGA retailers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers taste tests at IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted South Australian football league tickets to their loyal customers.
Metcash, the food, beverage and equipment wholesaler, is expected to provide more details about its defense strategy as it aligns its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is high, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash’s IGA store footprint, and produce higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian store owners are negatively narrow-minded and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they get in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30 percent more in GA and 24 percent more in BA than in Eastern states.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over about 5% of the market market in the next 12 months after opening its first stores in these two states, and that sales will be taken from existing players but generally from unpaved retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi’s forecast to open 30 stores in GA and BA next year, with $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr Kierath noted that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash’s high fixed-cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and tax.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent research that reveals that IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will fall by 4.1% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder and fund manager Hamish Douglass said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could be “most likely eliminated within ten years.”
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it turns out a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and its earnings from the food and market business, which supplies approximately 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, as sales and margins come under pressure.
But it’s overwhelmingly resisting, at Coles and Woolworths, it’s helping IGA retailers renovate their stores by making more than $150 million a year for matching shelf prices on a hundredth of a week, adding fast-growing fresh foods, and a better custom-branded brand.
Metcash executive chairman Ian Morrice says that price matching and store renewal programs are beginning to result, and that the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi deserves a lot of praise from critics for Kokkinakis' behavior.
Tennis Australian president Steve Healy said Thanasi Kokkinakis was injured in the last storm around Nick Kyrgios and deserves a lot of praise from the critics.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found Kyrgios under the spotlight that he disliked himself because of Stan Wawrinka's frenzy at the Montreal Masters.
In a tough afternoon game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison split by the file judge twice, Harrison said, "Wawrinka came over Kyrgios and I have to go over that kid."
Kokkinakis, who was seen breaking Richard Gasquet's rocket in a way that could potentially evade the U.S. Open, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second wicket in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain, behind Bernard Tomic.
Healy said, "What I feel very passionately about is that I don't think Thanasi is drawn to debate a little bit."
He was the first player to break the missile when he closed the front in the U.S. and lost it, but because he was disappointed, he wasn't the first player to break the missile and I know Thanasi shouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact in the United States, Harrison and others have managed themselves quite well under extremely proactive conditions, and I think he deserves a full compliment.
He has a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's gone a little too far.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, he works very hard and adapts to the team, he has no problem with other players, he is met with great respect in the dressing room, he does difficult exercises, he is extremely well-balanced and mature young and, according to me, he is entitled to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported Kyrgios's decision to welcome him for important collaboration; from Friday, he began to explain that what was right for everyone was "to make mutual decisions" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term ironhead.
Healy said: “First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not the clashes around [Kyrgios].
And for me, Nick, Federer, and Murray, as people have pointed out, the child is growing up very fast, growing up in front of the public and making some horrible mistakes and deserves all the criticisms he has received, but we are trying to support him, trying to understand the consequences of his actions, and trying to understand what he thinks he has done.
Europe's migrant crisis: Hungary has declared an emergency, closed its borders and taken care of migrants
Hungary closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, announcing an emergency for the purpose of cutting the flow of migrants, and took note of those trying to enter the country illegally.
Hundreds of migrants gathered in an uninhabited area, creating chaos on the border, and the Serbian authorities moved furiously.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries have built a tent on the roadside between the checkpoints of the two countries for an indefinite period of time and settled in these tents.
But his anger was increasing.
As a police helicopter passed from above, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian agile force police.
Some refused to give them water and food as a protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said that while the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues, it is "unacceptable" that Hungary should send migrants back.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to see the damage from this process.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries will have to be held in the coming days,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
This tension at the Hungarian-Serbian border came just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and hoped that by the end of next month or year, 120,000 more migrants from Hungary, including those from the future, will be accepted into the EU.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit next week to be held to address the continent’s migrant crisis.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the subject.
The emergency call in the two southern regions on Tuesday gives authorities broad powers to combat the crisis, including shutting down the roads as needed and speeding up the cases involving refugees.
On the other hand, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to draw along the border with Romania in order to stop the flow of migrants from this country after the fenced wire the country's border with Serbia.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata has announced that even prisoners in prisons have been charged with wiretapping between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major transit and transit point for European Union countries, and many of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the migrants coming to Europe are "economic migrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who are trying to escape the war - this idea is completely in line with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The law, which comes into force at midnight in Hungary, also imposes more severe penalties on human smugglers, in addition to crossing the four-metre (13-foot) long rope drawn to the Serbian border or making it a crime to damage it.
Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for the government, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged: “The Hungarian government is declaring an emergency because of the situation caused by total migration.”
Our idea is very clear: crossing the border by illegal means is a crime.
Although the military talks are yet to be approved by the parliament, Associated Press reporters in the area say they have seen dog and vehicle soldiers equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities had crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border and arrested 15 people who had entered the country.
They've gone through damage to cordoned wires, now they're in police custody, and they're being charged with felony under the new laws.
The authorities are repairing the wires quickly.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while a train wagon covered with stringed wires was used to close one of the crossings.
Along with the introduction of a small metal container where people are filled with clicks to carry out Hungarian operations, the chaos was also reflected at the main border crossing point near Roszke.
20 people were able to get in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's dominance of Bernie Sanders has halved in the national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is continuing her two-run leadership in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but you, Bernie Sanders, are growing up to him.
Clinton is currently taking 47% of Democratic votes (down from 58%) with Sanders in second place (27% up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will be in the presidential race, gets 15 percent of the vote.
For more than five months before the start of the main races, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate they would support.
But Clinton’s supporters have stronger ideas about their own choices than the other candidates.
Clinton has been losing ground between a number of demographic groups since CBS News last month, and Sanders, on the other hand, has some gains.
Clinton is at the forefront of a big difference between women and moderates, but that difference is closing.
Support between men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only following himself 5 points behind.
Clinton’s Democratic voter advantage under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now in the same position.
But Clinton is at the forefront of a huge difference in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with two home runs between liberals, but now Sanders is 5 points ahead of the group.
At the national level, nearly half of the Democratic voters say that if the party is a candidate, they will support Clinton with passion.
A quarter will support it under certain conditions, while another 15 percent will support it only if it is a candidate.
A six-percent cut doesn't support Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters tend to support her, especially with passion, in a way that is not at all surprising.
The views among those who do not support Clinton at the moment are even more confusing – only four can support him with passion.
48 percent of Democrats said they would support Clinton with passion, while less Republican-led candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked by Clinton supporters why Clinton wanted to be a candidate, the first-line answers had the right experience (16 percent), the idea that it was time for a woman to be elected president (13 percent) and the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also voice their relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
To be complicit in problems and selectability among the specified criteria.
As a potential vice president for the presidency, 57% of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of the electorate doesn’t think so.
When Democrats are asked what the second candidate election for the party is, Biden is at the top.
According to Sanders, more than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden could have a second election in the open.
If Biden doesn’t enter the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton’s superiority over Sanders increases; Biden’s level, which is 20 points in a race where Biden isn’t.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the best candidate to win the general election, but that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
While Biden is second in this regard, there was a backlash, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most eligible candidate showed an increase.
Once again, when asked what was the most important thing in a candidate, the Democratic voters put the issues ahead of the selectability.
Similarly last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate seems to be accepted as a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, as well as people with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is ranked first among the three in terms of honesty, while Clinton is strong on leadership.
According to thirty percent of Democratic voters, Clinton is not honest and reliable, half of which says the same thing for Sanders (15 percent) and 27 percent have no idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
On every scale, the Democratic electorate has no idea about Sanders.
While questions about the use of the personal email address and the server continue during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mission, most Democrats find it satisfactory to explain the issue to voters and state that their views on it are not affected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only one-third find it satisfactory.
The public's views on this matter were divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under siege.
Most American email scams say they don’t affect their overall views on Clinton, with negative opinions on the other hand rising by 36%, according to the report.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 people say their views on Clinton have been distorted.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of his own party, this issue is generally still a problem among registered voters: only 32% of voters see him as honest and trustworthy, which is eight points since last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not find him to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump take good note of the leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson, and Bush got the best points on honesty.
More often than not, he finds Sanders to be honest, but most people don’t have an idea about him like Carson did.
The margin of error in samples taken from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates conceded the game, and that the other candidates didn’t have much chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising to 27% in support of the latest CBS poll, which was conducted before last month's debate on Fox News, to 23% in the poll announced Tuesday.
However, Carson’s support increased from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson went quite well in demographic groups, and that the support among Republican voters for college graduates was much higher than Trump.
The remaining, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have now fallen to 2% from last month’s 10% support with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The margin of error of this latest poll, with 376 people elected from Republican voters, was 6% and the poll was conducted in September.
Last week’s CNN/ORC poll showed Carson’s support among Republicans to 19%, directly behind Trump’s 32% support.
The latest poll by the ABC News/Washington Post seriously showed Trump in front of Carson.
Trump, who faced last week’s rise in Carson, has continued to casually consult his retired brain surgeon, although Carson has questioned Trump’s belief.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said on Saturday, “We need energy.”
Five fraternal members of Baruch College are charged with the death of their first-class student
During a fraternity acceptance ceremony in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder cases against five people were opened almost two years after the death of a college student.
New York City Baruch College's Pi Delta Psi brothers attacked Chun "Michael" Deng in a September 2013 kick-off ceremony and, according to police, contributed to his death by delaying him to the hospital.
Authorities reported that his eyes were closed, that a 30-pound sand-filled backpack was stuck on the back, and that he was constantly sneezing as he tried to walk towards the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained over time that he was suffering and then lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng fell ill and waited an hour for police to take him to the hospital.
However, police commissioner Chris Wagner, speaking at the press conference, said they changed Deng’s clothes, searched Google for his symptoms, and sought advice by contacting his brother’s national president, Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said that at this point, members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He wasn't revived, and he lost his life the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered trauma from repeated blows to his head, body, and hip with a non-cut body.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement that as a result of the fraternity acceptance ceremonies, many families have been destroyed, losing their lives at least one student acceptance ceremony each year since 1970.
The Brotherhood and its members should be held accountable for this, and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
Monroe City’s grand jury recommended that a third-degree murder charge be filed for the first five members.
Thirty-two fraternal members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with taking part in the attack and with a penalty kick.
Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday that we will hold them accountable not only if there are people involved in the work, but if there is an organization that officially or unofficially confirms it.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed increases interest rates?
With the increase in interest rates, the bull market is on the rise and the marginal income rises, and the economy is shrinking.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will take and how long it will take.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about timing.
As with the first interest rate increase, the downturn was as short as 11 months, as it took as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Central Bank’s aggressiveness in raising the Fed’s interest rates has often been decisive in the response of economic and financial assets.
That’s why they strongly emphasize that U.S. central bank officials should focus on how long the normalization process will take, not when investors’ interest rates start to rise.
It is true that there are various variables.
But as a result, market participants may think that the rate of interest increase is exaggerated.
Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop, in a note to clients, said, "Since the global financial crisis, it is inevitable that the Fed's first interest rate hike will signal the end of the 'fee money' period by some."
On the contrary, we don’t expect U.S. interest rates to slowly return to normal, but it’s seen as a seismic shock that many of the levels that are still low are afraid of.
We can't say it's going to have any effect.
Based on past trends, the response that some areas of the economy can give is:
As seen in previous months in the market, waiting for interest rates to increase can destabilize some things for a while.
When the interest rate is increased, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed surges, Deutsche Bank analysts said: "It is seen that the first interest rate increase in Uzkainak is a 12-24 month standoff trend, which may reflect a standoff in monetary policy."
According to an up-to-date analysis shared by Nuveen Asset Management analysts Bob Doll at Barron's, the market is more likely to record sharp increases in the past 35 years - around 14 percent - and return to a straight line after 250 days, with an average of 14 percent, and an average of 2 percent, respectively.
Deutsche said the effect on the stockholders was more pronounced in the later stages of the growth cycle and that the yield was expected to disappear.
Retirement is a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed, in the current situation, is facing some situations that are not yet available and will speed up the downturn.
The most important thing to note is that the gross domestic product is at the lowest level to date for the Fed's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, an increase of 118 percent since 1950, with the nominal year-on-year net domestic income falling just two times below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed, it is expected by very few that the situation will be permanent and the third quarter will be watched at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it can be risky to increase interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment and lead to the question of “will it be different this time?”
The attention of market participants who have been waiting for the Fed’s interest rate hike for a year this week is at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe that FOMC can confirm an increase in this meeting, long-term trading points to only a 25 percent chance.
“In the research we’ve done since 1950, all the growth cycles that have taken place to date are within a super-increased trend cycle and reach peaks quickly after the start of the rally, with a relatively clean domestic feel,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a slow recovery from the worst backlash that occurred during a period of time.
The current cycle has been the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the last recession – the longest cycle on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we are in is still going on in the 74th month.
With the expectation of rising interest rates in the market, it is stable and has become unstable and looks like a regular hedge fund.
The difference is that when Fed policy changes its course, the effect is seen faster than it is felt in the bills.
When the first increase/decrease of the period comes, the table entries do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, the bond yields are falling immediately,” Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy experts, interest rate increases will align the trend by approaching returns between longer-term and shorter-term bonds.
Kathy Jones, from Schwab analysts, who said that high-yield bills often perform better in such an environment, said in the analysis, but “we’re careful about reaching out.”
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is widening, credit spreads are widening and fluctuating – all the features that will be seen in the market when tightening the Fed policy.
When viewed broadly, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will gain interest rates and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational corporations with too much debt will be worse, as rising dollar products will make it more expensive in the global market and the debt will be even more expensive.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs analysts for its customers, “History shows that ‘quality’ stock chains may experience a performance decline at the beginning of such an increase.”
Firms with strong balance sheets went down by an average of 5 percent from those with weak balance sheets following their 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate increases.
Companies with high capital and low fluctuating stock prices also surpassed their low-quality competitors by an average of 4 per cent (percent) with 3 per cent.
Debt is going to be a big issue.
According to Goldman, the companies with high-yield debt are most likely to suffer the most damage.
In addition to the clean stock market game, consumers are also expected to benefit from rising dollars.
Even though experts have different opinions on how fast they will keep them, savers can also profit from high profits.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham urges station to 'disappear'
He argued that the radio had become different from its commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused her of looting the British Awards.
Damien Collins has accused The Voice of not being original.
A senior deputy press officer told BBC Radio 3 that he was "returning" to Classic FM, saying that he was "returning" to the publisher in order to reveal his difference to other commercial stations.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said that the BBC's radio channel, which provides public services to its bosses, was "disrupting" and diverging from its increasingly commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use this tape, but Radio 3 is 'crazy', and it's going to turn into Classic FM," he said.
In addition, he also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were held in December last year.
Another version of the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, has been awarded.
Bingham said, "So if you're going to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, but you're holding and copying the same one that's already on the market."
Rejecting the BBC's general manager's objections, BBC Radio 3 argued that it was open-ended from its commercial rivals in terms of public education if necessary.
If I learn from Radio 3, I can't go and learn anything about classical music from anywhere else.
And that’s a commitment to live music, and making music can’t be compared to anything else.
He also said that I think Radio 3’s effort to explore new music and promote its work is also very important.
BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey argued that in order to reach more audiences earlier this year, the radio needed to work more closely with the past, as the British were less educated in the classical music field.
However, Radio 3 was not the only component to the ball because it pressed the BBC’s trade rivals’ tail at a meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Nationalist Tory Damien Collins de O Ses - the music talent of the BBC's Dutch production company Talpa Media - sold for <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Can’t you see why the program brings so much sound, because it’s not original and there’s no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, where Paloma Faith and Boy George were jurors, was done "in a way that has to the BBC."
He said the organization wanted to "find a hit of its own blood" before making another entertainment program.
What’s more, he didn’t accept the idea that more would be spent on the construction of that sound program in the future or on the use of content spent on licensing fees.
The reason why internet sales experienced the lowest increase in the history of internet sales in August is Black Friday?
In the first three months of 2015 there was a 7% increase in internet sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to break.
Three years ago, when mobile devices began to be used in shopping, there was an explosion in internet sales.
Experts say that Black Friday in November may be the reason for the cut in spending.
Online shopping has been booming for more than a decade and has turned the UK’s most vibrant shopping streets into a ghost town.
After the figures in the first three months of 2015, which showed that internet sales had only a 7% increase, experts say that internet sales are giving more and more signs of weakening.
In terms of total spending in August, only a five-percent increase was recorded in the previous year, and the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to break.
According to figures from the first three months of 2015 that showed an increase of only seven percent in internet sales, experts report that internet sales are giving more and more signs of weakening.
Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s sales index editor, told The Guardian, “If you look at the growth levels of previous years, and especially the 2000s, you’ll see that everything is actually back to normal over time.”
He added that three years ago, when consumers began using mobile phones to buy the product, internet sales recorded a huge increase.
This meant that more people could shop even when they were lying in a chair.
But right now you can see the (growth) landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept derived from America, is shown as one of the reasons why sales slowed down.
Experts say that in order to buy something, consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year’s event, many companies had collapsed when they attacked companies’ websites to capture consumer-friendly products five times more than the previous year.
Experts point out that Black Friday’s shoppers, who show that shoppers are struggling for a discount, may have been bullied “for the time being.”
A study published by the British Retailers Association found that every <0xC2><0xA3>5 spent on shopping, 1 in <0xC2><0xA3>1 spent on buying products online.
One-third of products, such as TV and washing machine, are now being purchased from online stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and showy shopping streets.
With the conviction of the family of bin Laden, the Muslims in Mecca have succeeded in their last voyages of those who lost their lives in a vindictive accident.
After the first funerals in Mecca, the remains of 29 people who lost their lives were moved to the streets by Muslims.
The construction giant Saudi Binladin, in charge of the vinch accident in Saudi Arabia, held the group responsible
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured after the fall of the vincin
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the remains of 29 people who lost their lives in the fall of a vincin mosque in Haram.
Mostly the crowd within the whites closed their first funerals to make their way to their last voyages at Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
A few days ago, the suffering crowd passed through the holy place where the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a vincin mosque had been laid down and poured over the pilgrims.
In the event that there were also 394 casualties, Binladin, the owner of the Saudi construction holding, was brought in to bury the remains of the dead.
The remains of 29 pilgrims who lost their lives as a vincin Messid-i Haram fell on their shoulders along the way
There were also four children from Manchester's Bolton district, the first of whom died when the vindictiveness fell among the dead.
Mr. Akram had come to Haram with his mother and father at the beginning of the annual Hajj worship.
Saudi leaders said Haqq<0xC4><0xB1>n would continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on his way to Mecca.
King Salman said in a statement today that Binladin Holding Group should not leave its vinyl arm open while out of use.
The Arabic version of the farm, prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, stated that the only party to be accused of the incident was the Binladin Group.
The English service of the news agency did not go through this detail, but the firm's officials were told that it was forbidden to go abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman had hinted that the vincin would find the reason why hundreds of thousands of Muslims who had come to Haqqaq were turned over to Haram's court.
Binladin's group did not make any statement regarding the revolving winch, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal farm accused the group of not taking up-to-date security measures and not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Mescid-i Haram, located in Makkah, is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are maintained by the Binladin group.
Binladin’s family has been in close relationship with Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades, and most of the construction projects are named after him.
Osama bin Laden, the last leader of al-Qaida's organization, was also the son of a foolish man whom the family had adopted from childhood.
The accident occurred only a few days before the Hajj land, where every adult Muslim had to visit the land of Hajj at least once in his life, in a time of severe wind and rain.
Officials said 158 people were still being treated in the hospital.
The authorities ordered the dead to pay compensation of 1 million Riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to their families and those who survived with permanent injuries.
The other wounded will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says there are Eastern European artists working cheaply behind this trend
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more masters
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European master craftsmen
As a result, more than 200 new Screwfix stores targeting artists are opening
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Chief Reporter of the Daily Mail City
The British are said to have started hiring skilled Eastern European artisans to do their homework instead of leaving their hammers and paint brushes in their hands.
If you are skilled at using hammers or in painting walls, you are a minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are increasingly working with more and more masters to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, the owner of the home improvement chain, said there was a huge increase in the number of East European skilled artisans offering services at low prices behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more than 200 new Screwfix stores for artists as it closes its 60 B&Q sales point.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store were made by women.
The majority of the staff is male.
She said there was a need to meet the growing demographic trends of the single woman's home, which has made more home improvements than in the past.
Ms. Laury said: "The majority of men still work in our stores.
We need to have more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80 percent of decisions about products purchased are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Britain’s top firms, one of five women at the top of the FTSE100 index, have also restructured the top team to consist of an equal number of men and women managers.
Kingfisher, the general manager and chief financial officer, is almost alone in this field, with a full 50 percent of his team consisting of women.
Ms. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to take to the management facility.
After the group was charged the cost of the closed stores, Kingfisher announced that there was a decrease in both its monthly earnings and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher 200, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open a new store
Time to decide on interest increase for the U.S. Central Bank
The two-day meetings of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday are being watched around the world; a decision is expected to be made on whether to increase interest rates after ten years.
In a poll conducted by Reuters, more than half of the 80 economists say the Fed will implement this decision last week, but now they think it will suspend the decision and keep the rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
This is a historic event seven years after the Fed's rate cut to zero.
Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at Peterson Institute of International Economics, said: “For the first time, we will see a large central bank emerge from a zero point and begin the process of normalizing interest rates.”
The U.S. economy is showing relatively good performance and is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet in the process of reviving the economy, creating little inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the global picture, which is less hopeful.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are signs that they believe the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Delta State University's Crime File Leaves an Apology Letter
According to officials on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note Monday morning saying that he was "right" for the first murder and "I can get back" to his girlfriend in Mississippi after he killed his girlfriend with a gun, and that he wanted to leave a note that said he was "right" for the first murder before he killed his workmate in the coming hours of the same day.
Mississippi Gautier police have called 911 at 10 a.m. at Delta State University, where Lamb is a geography and social science education instructor.
On Monday, he said he killed someone with a gun.
Lamb said he had to send police to the officer on the phone.
“I killed my wife last night,” Lamb said, adding that there was also “a sweet dog at home that doesn’t hurt anyone” and was probably sad.
The police asked her name, but she didn't say her name.
Lamb didn't make any statements about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, 41-year-old Amy Prentiss’ lifeless body and 45-year-old Lamb came across a note saying, “I’m so sorry, I wish I could take back the time.
I loved Amy very much, and she was the only one who loved me so far.
After writing this note, Lamb went by car to Delta State, 300 miles away, and killed the history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then committed suicide when the police retaliated.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamb is clear that there are certain things in his mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb, his girlfriend Prentiss, believed to have had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said Tuesday they had "no information or evidence" in their hands that there was a "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good man."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but made friends.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and the girl was "in a state of disrepair".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely each other's best friend."
According to Linsday Knowless, whom Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, Prentiss was working on the Internet from his home.
Knowles said Prentiss, the owner of a hunting dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about 3 years.
Knowles said, "He's always liked to help others."
Police called Lamb's relatives on Monday, saying "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, as the police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled aside, jumped in the sidewalk, ran into the woods, and committed suicide by shooting himself with a gun.
According to his CV published on the University's website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) had spent several years quite stressful.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 his life partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor, who was also said to be fighting drugs, was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of this, of course, did him a great deal of damage.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months with a double break
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two setbacks in a match in which Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
The incident, which smothers the defenseman in tears, leaves him at least six months away from the pitch, is hopeful that Louis van Gaal Shaw will be able to return to the pitch again this season.
The break-up caused Shaw to break into the pitch like a bomb in the 15th minute of the match with Hector Moreno.
She was intervening on the field for nine minutes, and then she had to be given oxygen before she was admitted to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "The leg is suddenly broken from its double place and is now in the hospital."
Maybe today or a day later, he'll be sacked and he'll have surgery in Manchester.
It’s a terrible situation – a young man who transfers to Manchester at the age of 18, you spend difficult times first, then you play a great game, and then that’s it for him.
He had an oxygen mask on his face while he was in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you're broke, that means at least six months, and that means you can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get rid of the red card and the hair part in the penalty shootout.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal argued that the Italian authorities had made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a very bad fight with two legs.
In a tweet on Shaw's account, he said, "Thank you all for your messages, not enough words to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery journey is now beginning, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffered a shock of Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The Champions League, to be held in France next July, will be moral for the recovery of the English defence player.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
If such an injury happens to any player, everyone will be sad about it.
The intention of our players is never to blackmail their opponent.
Moreno played for Van Gaal against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup but suffered a leg fracture.
The boy finds this very difficult because his intention was never to blackmail his opponent, and it was never good after he heard that it was a very bad break.
It was impossible for me to see that moment.
All I could see was the ball going in a different direction, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's play.
SBS 6 said: "I know what a feeling it is, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel so bad about it, and I'm so sorry.
PSV's fight with Chris Smalling at Andrés Guardado was removed to the hospital.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better than that?
This is something that every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that it won’t take much time to learn it.
Looks like you're not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children's book about child care by a holiday programmer supplier was, Prime Minister The Lorax chose Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental story.
In a message posted on the SuperCamps website, Cameron continues: “This book, which is a comic, impressive, creative, and powerful message, contains an image or message that we’ve always been able to convey to children.
Everything was going so well so far that Cameron wrote something about the book's content but actually added new characters and details to the book's 2012 film version to impress the content of the original story text.
A boy named Ted in the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone, even the walls where the weather is meta, wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree in order to win the heart of his daughter Audrey, who was born in the year 1991, and whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this did not come to you suspicious enough, in one aspect of the text that Cameron handled, it is very similar to the short summary text of the film The Lora in the Internet Archive, which begins with the words: "In the city of Teneed-V, where everything is artificial and even the weather is a meta, the peculiar name of the city of Teille-V is in the remains.
Despite the claims that his work is a proper parent, Cameron is a native of the local neighborhood of a young child named Lorax, who is also named after the book, who is shy and "spoken in the name of the trees" of the creature, who is hungry-buttered, and whose bees have been cut off by the bees, and whose bees have been eaten by the bees, and whose bees have been eaten by the bees.
Most likely, such a weak Public Relations business has been aired into an order box, which is also someone who apparently hasn’t read The Lorax to a child more than 20 times.
A spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but there was no comment on it.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England's withdrawal, but I'm still a genius.
It’s a difficult task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but I don’t think there’s a repeat of last time’s 3-0 Test series defeats after seeing the English team selected for the tour.
However, I don’t exclude the possibility of a displacement victory.
Alastair Cook’s team may be more inexperienced than it was three years ago, but they have well-rounded players on the line, and the collective game understanding is also strong; this does not improve the wounds of 2012, only provides a bit of youth-sourced optimism.
In the pool game, Moeen Ali develops as a game twister, and Fair Rashid represents an attack option even though his quality at the trial level is unknown.
Related: Adam Lyth quit the UK Test team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult decision for me to analyze as head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were opposed to two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but inevitable truth is that the critics are judged accordingly.
For example, there was no question mark about Joe Root, he was stuck with the announcement because - as I said earlier - the players were his own best choice.
After a few fifty-minute series, Lyth could see her career extended, but she determined her own destiny.
If he works harder for Yorkshire, I hope he gets another chance.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's style, although he didn't show his best performance, which didn't surprise me; he was a team man first of all.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it will take for a test hitter to get a note.
Lyth – like Sam Robson before him – took seven wickets, while Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton got a chance at a tie.
The only sentence you may feel for Jonathan Trott is that Britain may first go to the Caribbean — while Lyth’s form is at the top — but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level hitter.
We saw this in Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge at the beginning of this season.
It should at least be able to be taken for the same opportunity as before, but that depends, of course, on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen was going to make an opening fight with Cook so that he could get extra playable while holding four quicks, and I'm not against that.
I don't understand why a shooter can't shoot here, and that left-handed guy showed how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen couldn't do his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number 3 for them, and there's not much difference.
My ex-teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first drop before starting his 2001 release.
He got the three-hundred series right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari’s team comes as a substitute player and surprised me as an impressive young man in the limited interviews I had with him.
People can see both their stats - an average of 31 in the battle and a total of 35 in the battle - and they may think it's a draw but there's not a lot of turntables that raise their hands and player choices have been made since they were young.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Far from the team, England seems to have made a few curly additions to their own coaching team.
Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene could be a masterful measure of being hired as a consultant for Test matches.
One of the most beloved men in that game; he will bring with him a full experience, which has been won against every circumstance and every attack.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot of the tour and gives both energy and a ruthless series to the game order.
I’ve always thought he was born for the world of international cricket, whether he’s a player or coach, and he has an understanding that he can be guided like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring an innovation to the team, even if they convey the previously mentioned messages.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting for a day's play, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans, coaches, and players are not made by the selectors.
And you should remember that their job, like the players, depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never easy to make.
If the economy is stable by 2017, the Brexit camp could win
David Cameron’s half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and that’s Jeremy’s “Yes or No?” for Corbyn to be elected leader of the Labour Party or for TUC to step out of the fray over Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
In the past, a European diplomat is an idiot, and some member states in the EU have been immersed in the kind of crises they don’t fully cause, most of which they don’t want, and Britain’s only self-described divisive privileges and erratic contractual changes have made it clear.
The TUC made the decision that it would not want them if they were harmed by social protection at their annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellery are taking their own pictures, taking part in summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries, in front of the famous monuments there, and then saying that they have gathered allies for reform.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said “Don’t leave us alone with France” in the EU tent, my European friend, who wants a Britain that has returned to the outside world, said that there are more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals who have come to a point where they no longer care if we stay.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautious and wise-minded chancellor, is an ally, with whom she has been in power for 10 years, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) wants to get out of power without going bad, as in the examples of Mitterrand (16).
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces a re-election or power change in France in 2017.
He's also a powerful force.
Soon, a right-wing nationalist government in Poland and a left-wing government in Spain will come to power.
For the Selfie Britons, who have to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, it is unlikely that these countries will show an effort because they don’t want that either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, in the style of the Scottish National Party, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by inadvertently making statements that would not be useful during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign, my friend says.
"It would not be a negotiation again" and "Britain did not get anything to benefit from the renegotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative Fleet Street’s oligarchic press barons are because they were not so at the time Tony Benn had been the inspiration for the 1975 referendum, which approved our attempt in 1973 at a rate of 2 to 1.
This is how Boris Johnson, the leading Euro-opportunist known as the “EU flat bananas”, who was the Brussels reporter in the early 1990s, remembers.
Besides all the nonsense, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax bullies, illegal phone-listening foreigners, and so-called foreign residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking the same thing most of the time, but when he was bitten by a gory gorilla in a cage, he realized that he had to pay attention to it at lunch and after tea to avoid eating bananas.
In fact, Miliband was Blair's own Blair to oppose Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, as Blair had endorsed the principle of the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by the French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him about it.
But on Monday in Westminster, I told him that he no longer had time to lose me - Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, then and now he's under the threat of re-adopting Murdoch's boycott strategy in the '80s.
Although it will take time, not with me, but with the media, it is necessary to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC chair on Sunday.
I mean Corbyn's official position in Europe as a matter of courtesy.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people who were left out of Ukip's hostile tendency and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little England say yes to this.
Indeed, this is what Hilary Benn said on radio and television this week, as he naively forced himself not to admit that it was a bad idea to call Corbyn John McDonnell a shadow chance.
This reminded me of his father's fight over infidelity with his friends in the workers' cabin on television in the '70s, his long-awaited progress and his loss of office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But "Benn's statement - fighting to stay 'under all circumstances' was the same as what McDonnell said or what JC told his MPs at a special meeting on Monday night.
Considering that it touches me, Corbyn continues to maintain the importance of message discipline in the age of 7/24 TV, no matter what the detail, the vicious image that Corbyn is trying to convey, and especially in the social media arena, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it is reasonable to challenge Europe, which has secured the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's adaptation of Bennite's encirclement economy and anti-capitalist pasts about EU membership is no longer a particular issue among the left-wing opponents of narcissism, where only minor differences are among the cornerstones of the narcisssistic narcissism.
Just as in his transfiguration of NATO – Tom Watson, determined that JC will not campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will have to try to make a deal out of it for their masters in their countries.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital when they have their own dubious constituents, as well as Britain’s privileges, so that they can all get rid of them?
As I was told at the opening of the British Security Forum on Monday, the United States is already deeply disappointed by the weak minimum performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-saving Conservative Party government in power.
Experts Criticize UK’s Public Health E-cigarette Research
The researchers said in a 12-person meeting where an agency funded by the government had made e-cigarettes 95 percent less harmful than cigarettes, which are linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in the UK Public Health (PHE) e-cigarette report.
PHE published its report last month, which it described as a “point of reference” as “determining the details of the evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the health of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the head of Lancet's medical journal, PHE, targeted the "extremely fragile foundation" based on its main conclusion.
Two other researchers at the BMJ asked if the claims were "whether the mine was built on a rock or not."
Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is to rely on the effectiveness of policies."
They said the PHE's claims about 95 percent less harmful than smoking e-cigarettes at present are expected to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a 12-person gathering to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of their views on the harms of various products containing this nicotine; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the meeting’s sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, a company previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
He also said in a sustainability report that BAT also approved the public health promotion document.
They added that one in 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but that this was not a previously reported funding from Philip Morris International.
There was no information on how panel members were selected, but some of them included some known giants of e-cigarettes, some of which reported industrial funds in the article.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person responsible for tobacco at the PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell agreed that the research paper, which the group wrote, was “effectively” lacking “substantial evidence on the damages of most products according to many criteria.”
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said the allegations were too early to say "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the allegations in the BMJ had previously been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people who have had a life-long cigarette rash dies from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks e-cigarettes pose are small, but we should continue to look at their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear mission: to inform the public at a time when there is a great deal of confusion about the harms associated with tobacco, about what the evidence shows and what it does not show.
Nearly 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease each year, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
The evidence we have is that e-cigarettes carry only a small part of the harm caused by smoking, even if not risk-free, is clearly our national responsibility.
Former Channel 4 boss says BBC should leave EastEnders
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that its ad rivals could "give their right arm" for hit programs such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make type programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs like BBC4, which are likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, against its competitors' most rating field programs at valuable ranges.
After the BBC's CEO Tony Hall said the organization wanted to collaborate more with other organizations; Johnson said it had been unsuccessfully trying to establish a link with the BBC in its own time on Channel 4 for six years.
During an inquiry into the future of the BBC, Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee, “I am struggling with the idea of the BBC ordering and publishing programs that can be clearly shown by unsubstantial competitors.”
If you continue to apply for a license fee that I’m not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should be reduced to programs that at least others don’t or don’t order.
They publish The Voice in primetime because they want to provide as broad a support as possible in the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else can publish, which is ridiculous and blatantly ridiculous.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded with a reduced rate of tax.
One is The Voice, the other is EastEnders, and the other is actually in the company.
To be honest, the other channels give their right hands for it.
I'm trying to see how public service publications are.
I don't think it's going to miss the BBC.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of running after "because of the plight of the people who worked here, and because these employees saw this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular programs echo the comments of former Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell its programs such as EastEnders.
Johnson said BBC’s more appropriate public service programs went to BBC4 and that they could not measure the viewer here, but that they would be met with tax exemptions and that they would be able to follow up on the show’s <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in licensing fees to continue their religious duties.
They're putting them in spaces no one's ever gonna watch.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of people who make the best use of it.
Of course you all think, we all think, 150 pounds a year is a great value, but I wonder if the reason they do this for people with 150 pounds of huge money is that they don't watch too much BBC.
David Elstein, a former Sky and Channel 5 executive who provided evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should review the Reithian mission to "information, educate and entertain".
Some of the BBC's outings are now officially classified as education - it said that 1% of the TV outing and 0.1% of the radio - and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be a precursor to this and that it should be "responsible to inform, enlighten and educate".
Speaking about the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC only had to do something about Proms shown on TV and collaborate with advertisers to ensure that the whole thing is watched online, he said.
‘Sonogenetic’ allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the wire wolves change direction the moment they are hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have bred rescuers with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound-wave bursts.
The tiny wire wolves change direction as soon as they are hit by sound vibrations that people can't hear.
The vibrations are activated by rotating the genetically modified motor nerve cells in order to carry the tangle channels that respond to the waves beyond the sound.

The researchers said that the worms proved the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetic, so that an ultrasound could be used to activate a series of brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, can tell the procedure to one day take the place of deep-brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that provides electrical vibrations in people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms.
Wire wolves often do not respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they responded when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he finds strengthen the waves beyond the sound, allowing the rescuers to pass through them.
The amplified sound overwaves affect structures that are located in the linings of some wolf cells and are called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To create sound-controlled wire wolves, Chalasani genetically modified the wolves to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applied to modified creatures beyond the sound, the sound waves were amplified by micro-cracks and transmitted to the wolves, and the modified motor neurons were activated here.
This procedure is similar to optogenetics, which allows scientists to activate and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says there may be some advantages to this technique in the face of sonogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along an optical fiber to the desired point in the brain, low-frequency sound waves can seamlessly pass through the tissue and thus be sent into the brain over the skull.
“Using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, we believe that human neurons targeted in the clinical setting for certain neurological treatments can be made temporarily sensitive to the signal beyond the sound,” Chalasani said.
He also added that other applications could be concentrated on muscle cells and insulin-killing cells.
Unlawful torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
Advertising Is Harming Britain's Arms Trade
Watch the video of the anti-weapons exhibition of the International Af Organization.
Horrible killer drones!
Pranks that break your ankle!
Partially impacted bombs!
And electric shock cops that cause severe pain but don't leave a trace!
Produced for the International Af Organization, the British government’s ExCel Center in London’s Blacksmithing Centre for Defense and Security Equipment is a thin sound and line film shot to emphasize the desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the international media.

However, a different campaign also continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains and requires double-checking.
Using the London Metro’s sources and branding, the DLR line turns into a tank, saying, “Are you going to travel on the DLR between September 15-18?”
This September, a gun sales rep will attack the DLR... asking customers to help stop this gun show.
300 posters are from artists exhibiting at Bansky's Museum of Bad Designs in Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Guards Group, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>6 and has helped distribute it using "Advertising Area Strike Packs," claiming that "the bus stop on the planet has gained access to about a third of the advertising space."
Transport to London was not pleased with this poster of "vandalism."
One of the ads was created by a group of Special Guards.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Zalim Designs and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more and more questionable every day and are looking for ways to transport political affairs to crowds outside of galleries.
Many artists are acting with activists in protest movements, and they are starting to realize that their art has to come to the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-trafficking poster also stands out in front of those traveling on the subway.
The video of the International Af Organization was viewed more than 100,000 over Facebook within 24 hours and created by the free-working VCCP advertising agency and prepared by the voice artist with a graphic designer for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against gun fairs ads – with empty space on ExCel’s calendar – and thought, “Let’s offer them a campaign they’re trying to escape.”
More realistic, they played with the idea of making a corporate ad, but "they decorated with bright colors and animation, became more attention-grabbing."
Tom Davies of the Af Organisation said: "They have helped us a lot to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the neighborhood."
Now we need the UK government to take action to prevent the illegal sale of torture equipment in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the gun show comes from the ExCeL inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab showed the U.S. military's "thrown out AT4CS RS" order.
It has “uniquely shaped and targeted weapons of war headlines that strike a big blow.”
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in the student’s home
An uninterested 19-year-old student has been transported to his home country for 11 years, and I still believe in berets and morals, but now I remember the ridiculous smiles I made—and the countless complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be broken into eight golden rules.
Moving around the country can be viewed from nervous breakdown to complete horrendous obscurity.
The pervasiveness of modesty: where people are, where they have lost years, where they insist on Corbyn, and why you don't "love or hate frankly Marmite, because really, gentlemen, I'm just going to be in my room in May alone."
Take a breath.
And let others take one too - ask questions and show them the connection.
This will guide the conversation and will help you to separate what you like from people you won’t talk to, even if your eyelashes are holding on and they’re getting tired of the fire.
Leave some space for people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and public hanging spots, but these are also places where people dress and set up their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting a relationship with the university.
Those who go back inside are treated badly at the university.
Your room can be an intimate place, but many home corridors develop a culture of inter-room attachment, and this is open to friendships, social and lifelong.
This energy could be hell for someone trying to store it.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little bit so that I can put the energy I spend in contact with you.”
Try to feel that your friend is tired of socializing and perhaps texting instead of stealing the door.
When you knock on the door, do it.
A friend in the student's home had taken a policy as he was invited inside if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Ever since you started college at the peaks of food competition madness, it's less weird to introduce yourself by playing people's doors with a plate of brownie and less 1950s "welcome to our party, I'll cook you something, now I'll smile when you ask personal questions."
Giving people homemade gifts is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates feel compelled to talk and maybe they’ll associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Obviously, this is about being a master chef.
A well-mixed ball ball is an ointment, sugar and oil, which will cause people to do the sleeping routine when you steal the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in students' homes.
Frankly, it's stealing to chop someone's chicken, but stealing a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the owner's milk twice.
He'll probably tell you to look after your own head, even if he's swimming inside.
It's a lot of trouble for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand you -- but try to deal with it in a more mature way than my country friend. He put liquid soap in it to punish the one who stole milk.
She's in jail now.
Don’t make noise to keep people from sleeping or from working.
It doesn’t just mean being the right person, but because you’re the ones in the glass houses.
A girl in my corridor told her neighbor to press and split the drums a bit because it was 3:00 p.m. and she had her morning exam.
Their answers were even more open.
When she finally shut down at 5 a.m., she gently allowed them to sleep for two hours before closing the door and closing the door.
Wouldn't it be too romantic for your future wife to move to the same corridor as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be very strange that you misunderstand a corridor friend and think that he is his future wife, that you have to hang out, leave him and see him every day and watch your co-workers get arrested?
Of course, this is voluntary, but if your neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least speak with a little and recommend a healthy one.
When you realize that at a joyful moment someone leaves the door unlocked, you know that the line between joking and offending someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun but it will take time to come back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding their belongings – but never pollute someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in the freezer, but don’t stick your items to the ceiling more than twice.
President of the parliament of immigrants to the Netherlands
Arib, who received the highest vote in the fourth round of the assembly election yesterday, became the first Speaker of the Dutch parliament of immigrant origin.
Arib, who also has Fas citizenship, will be in charge of this task until 2017.
Arib has been a member of parliament since 1998, and he was nominated for president in 2012 but has not been elected.

Her heart stopped when she was beautiful
Raquel Santos, 28, a mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, applied to the aesthetic doctor last Monday to erase traces of laughter on the sides of the mouth.
After a while, the woman who was injected with the filler on her face accelerated her heartbeat and breathing.
Then his heart stopped, and he lost his life.
Police are investigating whether the drug "Potenay" that the woman uses on a daily basis has a role in her death.
The real cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model’s closest friends, said in a statement to the Brazilian press that one of Santos, a 7-year-old and two of his 13-year-old sons, was obsessed with aesthetic surgery.
Santos was the second of Brazil’s most important beauty contests to enter Musa do Brasil in December.
Oil companies have officially collapsed.
Since oil prices began to fall in 2014, investment of nearly $400 billion has been delayed until the end of last year, while deep-sea (deep-water) oil exploration projects have been suspended.
According to Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm, low oil prices led to the suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/manufacturing projects, while millions of barrels had been produced in a vast geographical region from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
The biggest reason for the cost cuts is the fact that in the summer of 2014, the company’s budgets were dramatically reduced, with oil prices falling to the lowest level of 12 losing 70 percent in 1.5 years.
400 MILLION DOLLARS ASKIDA
While crude oil prices are making new surprises every passing day, they have fallen below $30, seeing the lowest level in the last 12 years.
“Will oil fall to $15,” the study published by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices in the wake of the “is oil now cheaper than water” debate.
Wood Mackenzie, who recently published a report in July, revealed that falling oil prices caused a $200 billion major energy investment of $46 billion to be suspended, reveals in his new research by the end of 2015, where this figure was reached.
According to this, in the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects were delayed, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since the start of the oil meltdown in 2014.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
DAY 2.9 MILLION VARIELS
The study, stressing that the impact of low oil prices on company plans is “extreme,” notes that the most affected projects are deep sea development projects.
The projects that have been suspended total 27 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, while the daily production of 2.9 million barrels of crude oil is thus delayed by 2025.
According to the research, the final investment decision of most of these projects was delayed to 2017 and beyond, while the first production targets were also recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects that have been postponed, the report highlights the potential investment of $170 billion expected to be made over the next five years, "the majority of $170 billion in deep-sea projects."
This is because the cost of pre-investment is very high.
“Seventy percent of deep-sea spending is primarily generated by oil-heavy projects in Nigeria, Angola, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.”
According to the research, the countries with the most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have nearly 90 percent of their reserves of delayed liquid (petroleum).
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the largest reserves of delayed gas, together account for 85 percent of the total.
While much of the natural gas waiting to come out here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as setting up a zero-liquidated natural gas (LNG) plant.
While the companies that are most at risk are oil giants with commitments that follow each other in the deep sea, Canada's oil sands and the Hazard Zone, it is also said that the companies are trying to adapt to the "longer lower" oil prices scenario.
LOOKS IN IRAN
It was not until four years ago that the United States and Europe brought an embargo on Iran’s oil to stop Tehran’s nuclear program, the price of the barrel of oil was about $110, and Iran’s oil exports are squeezing without causing a sudden jump in prices.
When we get back this week, we see a different scenario.
Oil prices have seen gold for the first time since 2004 for $30, the main reason being the U.S. production boom, and embargoes on Iran are rising.
That's why they're looking at Iran.
In the event that Iran increases its oil exports, there will be more oil flowing into the oil market, which is already quite saturated.
This can also cause prices to fall below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to market Iran, will pump more oil, and there could be a price war between Iran and S. Arabia.
The pledges do not stand still, with Iran’s main target being Asia’s fast-growing oil market being its former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials said in their earlier statements that they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first stage and to bring that amount to market after a while.
According to Reuters’ map information, there are 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) waiting in Iran’s open, at least 13 of which are fully or in large quantities.
Iran is the country with the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserves.
With the exception of sanctions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some of Turkey’s countries.
Prior to the construction, Iran’s daily oil exports had risen to 3 million barrels per day.
Aysun G<0xC3><0xB6>ksu, a research scientist in China, answers the question of whether oil falls below $20: “China’s central global growth concerns are increasing downward pressure on commodity prices, leading to a deepening of the loss in oil prices.”
As the world’s largest oil importer, China is experiencing a slowdown in the economy, with concerns that oil demand will decline to 20 percent since the beginning of the year.
In addition, we can witness prices below $30 in oil in the coming days due to the global value gains and the impact of the global surplus supply problem.
As long as we don’t see lasting prices above $32-33, the upward movement in oil may remain limited and the downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that the sighting of closures below the $30 level has a key role to play in keeping the falls going.
In such a case, it should not be a surprise to see relaxations lasting until 23.30-25.60 in the support area on the lower side.
Isham Sardouk: 'The Angelic Era is over!'
While Victoria's Secret and WGSN are taking on the task of trend creation, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
- I always prefer change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then I went to New York.
I also held important positions there.
Meanwhile, I've been advising Koton for the past two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized that there was everything necessary to be a chain of stores in the world.
Now I'm here to do it.
Will you be able to do it in a short time?
- I'm sure.
Although it is already a young brand, it is currently sold in 50 countries.
We produce 50 collections a year, 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a chain of stores should have.
We can meet the needs of consumers in different regions from Dubai to Moscow.
Now we are opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It’s not because Europe’s economy is amazing.
But you can open some stores for the image.
In fashion capitals like Paris, London, you'll have a shop, you'll make money from the Middle East.
One brand has prestige, the other has money, and both are necessary for a brand that plays a global role.
Let's talk about trends...
- We've got a very romantic, stylish season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Drawings...
We are going through very difficult and cruel times, and the fashion world is always trying to add a spark of happiness to life by bringing stylish, interior design to the podium in these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why the new season's "honorary season" is coming back.
Let's get back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
- Who was the most legendary angel?
I’m not just talking about great physics: she’s so positive, she’s such a good girl!
He sat next to me while I was working, and he fed me with apples, like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, she was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, and I've researched all the Victoria's Secret models you've interviewed.
How beautiful is Caroline, isn't she?
But Adriana Lima also impressed me with her beauty.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you say, "Sit down and look good, don't do anything else."
He's getting nervous.
That's right, that's the kind of shock that's going on.
I had an interview with Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was horrified by her ugliness.
- Most of them are.
The new angels are not like the old ones.
I remember Gisele's time...
It was also very difficult to work with him.
The culture comes, it smokes like a cane.
Not because he's a tyrant.
No one can drink, and only one can drink.
The goal is to make a diva.
Two months ago, Victoria's Secret received the lowest rating in its history.
What do you think?
Like I said, it's the end of that legendary era of beautiful angels.
Who's going to do Gigi Hadid?
What's so beautiful?
Like Kendall Jenner, like a tree...
I don't have any wrinkles, nothing.
Kate Moss's curves are also zero, but she's the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful his face was.
I want to exercise my right of objection here.
Last year, I had an interview, and my face was a little slumped.
- So much smoking, drinking, now it's dirty.
But he had such a beautiful face in his twenties.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
It was the end of that supermodel period.
In the days of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my neighbor and I used to see her every morning without makeup.
Such a situation is beautiful, it cannot be such a shame.
And how to live?
- He's hurting himself.
Not all campaigns are included.
Tired people.
There's no hunger for famous models like the old ones, for celebrities.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
And we're going to go over that.
Because that's the trend.
Letter from 25 authors from Turkey
According to BBC T<0xC3><0xBC>rk<0xC3><0xA7>e, the International Writers' Association (PEN) is a writer whose presidents in England, Wales and Scotland are among them; a typical example of the life-span of threats targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey.
In the letter, two attacks targeting H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet newspaper in Turkey, including the arrest of the Koza group and the arrest of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists, were among the worrying developments.
The right to half-work was debated by the mother.
"We believe that mothers are given half the right to work so that the rental work can be brought back."
“This could be a troubadour,” T<0xC4><0xB0>SK said, “we are concerned that this regulation will prevent women from working.”
New rights, which are planned to bring postpartum or postpartum birth or adoption to civil servants and female workers, have passed through the commission with full-day meetings.
After 6 months of work or free leave, the most common topic in the commission discussions of arrangements that bring the possibility of working part-time until the child’s primary school age was “rental employment”.
The CHP <0xC4><0xB0>zmir National Councillor Musa <0xC3><0x87>am, who stated that it was right to do some work until the child went to primary school, said, "If you bring the arrangement of rental work behind it, we will face it to the end."
Enis Ba<0xC4><0x9F>dadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who participated in the Commission's meetings on behalf of Turk-<0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F>, said that they experienced similar concerns, "We have doubts as to how the position of the female employee will be filled in half-time work."
Ba<0xC4><0x9F>dadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who stated that if the rental workers come back to work on this occasion, new problems will arise that will overlap the work of the carpenter, "we will therefore be watching with concern the developments related to the private employment offices."
B<0xC3><0xBC>lent Pirler, the German general secretary, said that part-time work had been brought under the law for 5 years, "There is no such long-term part-time work in other countries."
And look at it this way.
“Where there are 1 or 2 employees, we need to think about the results of this application,” he said.
TOBB Ambassador Ahmet <0xC5><0x9E>a<0xC4><0x9F>ar also said that if the application survives, it will be difficult to find workers.
<0xC5><0x9E>a<0xC4><0x9F>ar, who said there was no regulation on the rules to be applied in the half-time study, said that "a settlement should be made between the worker and the employer, who arranges for private employment offices."
Metin Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu: We do not support
Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu's statement: "We do not participate in this announcement, we cannot participate and support it."
Because there's no criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, even a sentence to the divisive terrorist organization, you didn't put dust on it.
We do not take the heavy expressions that are spent solely on the state seriously and do not find sincere, taking them into account those who spend them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, the public officials, the security forces have an illegal behavior within this framework, we will follow it.
When we say, "Don't destroy the state," we are attacked by the remnants of the post-war period, who look at the dividers or dividers with sympathy, and they say, "Share, fascist."
When we say, “This state should act according to the law, it should always prevail over the law,” they say, “You divide.”
We're bridge.
We are always committed to telling the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgian Wrapped, was born on July 16, 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his mother and father, he settled in Ankara with his mother Sebahat <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r in 1966.
Yenimahalle entered the Piano section of the Ankara State Conservatory after Jonas Emre Primary, but left due to financial difficulties and worked for a while at the PTT, enthralling his age.
In 1979, he accepted his offer to work at the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends.
In the Feyman Night Club, together with the Grup Lokomotif orchestra, he took the stage with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashion of the period.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released "I Have a Story", the first long album from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, unable to resist her husband's violent act as he continued his art career, has repeatedly escaped his wife.
In October 1982, while working in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir, she was shot in the face with her husband's humiliation.
Bergen, who lost his only eye and burned a large part of his body in this attack, was convinced and taken to the stage by Cengiz <0xC3><0x96>z<0xC5><0x9F>eker, the composer of the post-treatment song "Who Knows?"
The artist, who had staged at <0xC3><0x96>z<0xC5><0x9F>eker's <0xC4><0xB0>zmir P<0xC4><0xB1>rlanta Pavy<0xC3><0xB3>n until 1985, together with his patron, prepared a demo tape called "Sister Cader" and sent it to Ya<0xC5><0x9F>ar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who likes Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Severe", gained fame with the artist Burhan Bayar's "Woman of Suffering" making it to the end of 1986.
With the album's much-loved popularity, the label was awarded the Gold Plate and Gold Cassette in April 1987 with the title of "The Most Satanic Arab Women Artist of the Year 1986".
In the same year, Yal<0xC4><0xB1>n G<0xC3><0xBC>lhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron appeared in the film The Woman of Suffering.
Gaining a large crowd of fans, Bergen was last rescued from the knife attack in Adana, where he went for the concert.
The artist who left the stage for a while, the great masters Salami <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, <0xC5><0x9E><0xC3><0xB6>zer <0xC5><0x9E>enay and Cengiz Tekin, respectively, released the albums "I Don't Know Him", "The Price of My Love" and "I Don't Want".
Bergen, who officially divorced her husband in April 1989, made her return to the stage in June 1989, with her last album, Years Without Forgiveness.
The artist, who began the album's promotional tours with intense interest, was shot and killed by his wife, Adana, on the night of her divorce at Pozant<0xC4><0xB1>, which connects August 14, 1989, to August 15, 1989.
His country was buried in Mersin.
Bergen has recorded 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 cassettes for her 29-year short life.
Allegations that the artist who signed with Arabica with a different and strong voice was legendary have been confirmed by the demise of the album "Giden Youth", which was released after his death.
Bergen's officially released studio albums:
1982 - Complaints I Have LP (reprinted as MC in 1986.)
1983 - Brother Cader LP (1985 and 1990 reissued as MC.)
1985 – Human Severe LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).

Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom is mentioned on the 114th birthday
Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Ran, known as the Poet of the Nation, was mentioned in the 114th year of his birth with the event "Good that you were born Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m".
The event, organized by the Municipality of Konak, took place in the hall where the name of the poet was given.
The famous poet's poems, theatre and film actor R<0xC3><0xBC><0xC5><0x9F>t<0xC3><0xBC> Asians performed at the event, performing poetry and music recitals.
The event also accompanied the Three Anatolian Music Community to Asia with its comments.
Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m has accompanied many art lovers to the event of Wisdom.
Among these names were the Supreme Elector, Erko<0xC3><0xA7> Torun, Nedim Star and Zeynep G<0xC3><0xB6>knur Star and Ziya <0xC3><0x96>zs<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC3><0xBC>men.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazim Wisdom Culture and Art Foundation.
Founding President Rutkay Aziz and members, wife of N<0xC3><0xA2>z<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet, met Vera Tulyakova's daughter, dame and grandson, actor Tar<0xC4><0xB1>k Akan in Tarabya for the event.
He will read poems with the slogan "Living is like a tree and a bush / And a forest to his brother" and leave the carnations to the sea.
The event, organized with the contributions of the Municipality of Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer, will be accompanied by the songs of the N<0xC3><0xA2>z<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom Choir.
Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was repeatedly arrested for political reasons and spent much of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nil<0xC3><0xBC>fer Municipality has done special work on the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nas<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet.
The municipality, which works for the document "The Nativity of Bursa", which recounts the days of the 11-year-old Bursa Prison, also raised personal money for the first time in the history of Turkey for the poet.
Thus, in cooperation with PTT, the first personal money in the history of Turkey was withdrawn in the name of Nazim Hikmet.
This special coin with a price of 1.40 TL and first day envelopes will be presented to guests on the night to be held at the Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom Culture on Thursday 14 January.
They will be out of bounds by bicycle.
However, since no agreement is reached between the two countries, most Syrian refugees will be forced to return to Russia this time by turning the pedals upside down by 20 degrees.
Because it was safer and cheaper in the summer months, a group of refugees flew to Russia from here to the north of the country, moving from Murmansk to Norway.
As the agreement between the two countries did not allow migrants to cross the border by road, the border was crossed by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
For this reason, Norwegian security has instructed the repair of bicycles that have been abandoned across the border.
EU crisis "3 billion euros to Turkey"
Turkey is facing a crisis of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion committed to refugees.
Jean Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, criticized Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the fund to be transferred to Turkey.
Noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
“This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey.”
We haven't reached $3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of the EU's reliability, which is why it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26, the date it was previously given.
When it comes to Italy, Turkey is among the countries that pay attention in a positive way.
Diplomatic sources argue that Rome’s stance on the financial package is not directly a move towards Turkey, and that it is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some of the union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
At the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants, and after that, German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU continued to criticize the EU in a harsh language.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi's stance at yesterday's press conference, said "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"Renzi, who I love very much, is wrong to humiliate the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker promised that Renzi would play for the general public.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion promised to Turkey will be met from the EU budget.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion will come from the budgets of the Member States.
Germany will contribute at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>427 million.
For political reasons, it was decided that the Romanian government would not transfer money to Turkey to transfer its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.3 million stake in the EU budget to support Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
When I saw Chalie Hebdo, I cried.
His father, Abdullah Kurdi, spoke to the Russian official news agency Sputnik and said, "I cried for this cartoon if you want it to be true."
“I felt so bad,” he said.
Father Kurdi, who expressed his expectation of positive things from the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad caricature.
Everyone was so upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a two-year-old boy and has died.
Aylan was supposed to respect me and my family, Charlie Hebdo, but it was the opposite.
This magazine should respect the people who have died.
The Prophet has published an disrespectful cartoon about our master.
They even made revelations about God.
It is a small thing that is done to my child against Allah and the Prophet.
The Kurdish living in Erbil made the call: "I call upon the whole world and the magazine of humor, and all the children who have died must be respected."
They should not suffer the pain of not bothering their families.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has the impression that the 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who shot his lifeless body on the shore of Bodrum in a signed caricature, may be one of the bullies in Germany.
The French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who had been involved in an attack that killed 12 radicals last year on the grounds that he had published cartoons by H.H. Muhammad, has once again been the subject of controversy over his cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
In the cartoon, in Cologne, Germany, at the beginning, as in the women's parades that took place during the Christmas celebrations, there were cartoons depicting the faces of pigs and the call for migrants.
The cartoon, which causes different reactions on social media, is actually part of a 4-square column.
It says "France is not this" on the column, and according to many readings, it is criticized for increasing refugee hostility along with other lost values belonging to France.
On the other hand, the caricature still caused many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine criticized France's unwillingness to open its doors to migrants, overtaking Germany, who agreed to take 800,000 refugees in a number published last year.
In the cartoon, he was called "too close to his end," while in the commercial, he wrote "two children's menus at a price."
'Sultanahmet' dies in German autopsies in Germany'
According to the news on the website of the weekly Der Spiegel magazine, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office decided to bring the remains of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be celebrated today or tomorrow by an aircraft belonging to the German Air Force and at the country and airport.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Office (BKA), which conducts forensic medical procedures, go to the countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks, identifying and autopsies there.
But Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Department appealed to Turkish authorities for the identification and autopsy of the dead in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Service sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has lost her life.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly involved in his major work on the origins of capitalism.
The works of Latvian-born Meiksins Wood, who was born in New York in 1942, are as follows: Escape from the Class -- Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Anti-Democracy Capitalism -- Capital Empire -- Return to Marx
Prohibiting swimming pool for men in shelters
The news, which is in the German press, said the municipality would lift the ban if it was reported that the message of the ban was understood by the refugees.
In a statement to the WDR, social housing official Markus Schnapka, who noted that the municipality did not want to punish criminals because of the behavior of several people, said they had informed the remaining residents in Germany in three languages about the values that mattered to them.
Schnapka, who noted the value of gender equality that Germany attaches importance to, added that the municipality would punish all kinds of attacks and harassment.
On the other hand, due to the possibility of the tragic scandals in Cologne, the carnival passage in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of imminent carnival passages.
The municipality announced that the carnival passage had been cancelled as there was no guarantee that the tragic events would not take place.
What are the benefits of steaming?
The technique of steam cooking, a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in foods, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steam cooking, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East, has made metabolism strong and makes digestion easier.
Bacteria and microbes inside the food, which completely eliminate problems such as indigestion, also die completely.
Substances such as protein, cellulose, and starch in food completely dissolve with this technique, which makes the food softer.
Cooking in steam that takes place at low pressure; it is carried out in the pot with the help of steam pots or steam machine.
In high-pressure cooking, the amount of water used and the cooking time is small.
As the best example of this, you can show the cooking in a buttoned pan.
In order to cook vegetables, such as vegetables, which are included in diet menus, you need to wash the vegetables thoroughly first, and then wait for them to rinse thoroughly by putting them inside the sauce.
A deep tank is filled with water at a rate of one-third, and the steam is placed inside the sprinkler tank.
The mouth of the tank is left to be half closed.
This ensures that the steam comes out of the tank easily.
The January fire is first brought to the highest level by the water source, then a constant heat is obtained by bringing the January fire to a lower level.
The vegetables and foods cooked in the steam for about 10 to 15 minutes are carefully cooked, checked with the help of a fork.
The cooked vegetables are taken from January and served by placing them on the plates.
In steam cooking technique, the appearance, color and smell of the body do not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of the food itself remains the same.
The quality and taste of the food will not be compromised.
At the same time, in steam cooking, one of the most economical cooking methods, the loss of food is kept to a minimum.
The vegetables cooked in the steam provide a satisfying feast, yet with their more lively and lively appearance.
This method, which is often used in diet meals, is also often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie as Blackstar: The Last of the Aliens
Knowing you're going to die; making that last album without telling anyone, making the deathbed an artistic expression in the clip you're shooting...
Things like this; we may seem too “out” for worldly fans.
I say worldly fans because I am among those who sincerely believe that the man who does this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to Earth from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; that's what happens.
It came because only Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga had an inspiration that should be given to all the artists of the Earth.
He's done his job with dignity.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes Price: 9.99 TL 5/5
Probably from Warhol, who was on the same planet as him, fed from Kubrick.
When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "Is this something that I'm an alien," and he mixed up with us by saying, "Space Oddity."
He didn’t really get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose it.
Both the musician and the listener...
It would be unfair to say "just music" for his music if we would leave him interested in plastic arts and his acting aside.
The characters who wander from song to song and create their own; the discography with their send, innovation, taboo-virtueness expresses an artistic wholeness to me.
I can't remember him being the father of glam rock or the cousin of punk.
If so, what would happen to those avant-garde electronic movements that he's kept in love with since he was a child?
David Bowie reminded us of the meaning of the word “icon” in our mouth up to the years we’ve been chewing on it.
He wasn't a man, he wasn't a woman, he wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
He left this world two days after his 26th studio album "Blackstar" was released.
Before the album was released, he tried to train us to go with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus."
We were thinking, "He's getting old, he's talking about death," and he was aware of everything.
Another last game...
The album's message and emotional charge have been released much earlier, except for the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", but we can count on the song "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", which was re-released with the song "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore".
I would like to say that "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are very good songs.
When we look at it as a whole, it's built on a very strong musical structure, but it's "Blackstar", as it's made with so many subtle, instant sensations...
No death, no "counting with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
From the beginning to the end, it's called "The End" of a musical life.
Turkey Targeted in Sultanahmet Attack
German Federal Security Department President Holger M<0xC3><0xBC>nch was involved in a program on German first channel ARD on Tuesday in the Sultanahmet Square, where 10 German citizens were killed, the statement said.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
"I've seen 400 people."
But M<0xC3><0xBC>nch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terror in Germany, saying "we are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch pointed out that there was a decrease in the number of people who went from Germany to Syria to join ISIS, and that many people returned from war zones.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch, who said this was a major challenge for security forces, said: "There are almost 400 dangerous people we should not be monitoring right now."
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch called for better coordination between police agencies in Europe and for closer communication to be made.
Turkish officials said the live bomb, which was part of the Sultanahmet attack, was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, and German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the identity of the attacker had not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a concert series, charmed his fans with the "Sezen Years" concert he gave at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the concert series, which was held in July, also took place at the Volkswagen Arena on 15-16 January.
At the concert, Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to the love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu also sang songs on social issues that closely concern our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to his stage life after performing the concerts he promised, regretted his fans.
At the "Scene Years" concert, the Sezen Aksu came out with a separate story on each track in front of loved ones who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, show, light, and scene took viewers to different periods of time.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, a video show was also held, in which Erbil’s paintings of Revolution Istanbul were featured.
Aksu also took part in the videos, which were previously recorded by her fans, and invited them to the stage.
In Ankara and <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul, there are 25 pajamas for bread.
In Ankara, about 250 grams of bread were ordered for 25 peas, starting from 1 TL.
The Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animal Welfare, Faruk Steel and Customs and Trade, B<0xC3><0xBC>lent T<0xC3><0xBC>fenkci, had made statements in the form of "no time" on the rumors about the "future of bread" before the new year, especially in December.
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold from 1 TL yesterday.
Halil <0xC4><0xB0>brahim Balc<0xC4><0xB1>, President of the Turkish Federation of Ovens, with the 25th crop of bread, said, "Time has not been done, the tariff decision began to apply 2 years ago" and added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Union of Chambers of Commerce set this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
So a new call was made and the price did not go up.
But because of the competition, in some areas in Ankara, the mill sold 75 peas.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
He didn't put down the price of bread on his table. They have to apply 1 TL because of the competition.
There is no increase or decrease.
They're applying an unenforceable price.
“In the first half of 2016, the price of a kilogram of bread will certainly not exceed 5 TL and we will finish the year with this price if we don’t have a very big problem.”
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for 1.25 TL.
This time, the terrorists found the blood of Burkina Faso.
In an attack targeting a luxury hotel, which is known to be preferred by foreign and United Nations officials in Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries have died.
The attack was carried out by Al Qaeda's North African arm.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIL's terrorist attack in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, which is the world's most populous Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
Foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops on a busy street in the Starbucks branch and police station during a day-to-day bombardment and armed attack; a Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the November 13 Paris massacre.
Frank Garner, the security correspondent for British BBC television, also noted that the move has been part of a frightening trend that has been emerging in many cities around the world in recent times.
The U.S. suffered a short time ago from acts of terror.
In early December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by a pair of ISIS sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, last month.
San Bernardino attack on U.S.
German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere recalled that there had been terrorist attacks in many parts of the world following a live bomb attack in Sultanahmet where 10 German tourists had died, saying: “We have had two major attacks in Paris.”
If we say so, then terror will win...
We used the phrase "step back" without stepping back.
ISIS quits Whatsapp, talks with Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terror organization is using its own chat tool to communicate independently from chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to a report by Defense One, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging app to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and uploaded via an APK file.
The application allows the organization to communicate with each other in a cryptographic way and share media.
Flash movement from ISIL to Iraq
The functionality of the app remains “prior” to popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
It is not yet known how strong the encryption is.
ISIS had previously carried out all of its communication via a Telegram app that allowed it to send messages over a encrypted connection.
However, Telegram had revealed the channels spoken by ISIS members.
Furthermore, the U.S. administration requires app developers to place backdoors on their apps.
That’s why the organization is now starting to use its own solutions instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram encryption.
UAE: Iran's nuclear deal satellite
Kerry, speaking at a press conference held in Vienna, said that Iran had fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear deal and that the United States had officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran: the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has imposed sanctions on Iran in its immediate aftermath.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a tweet that he welcomed the lifting of sanctions after the nuclear deal between six countries and Tehran, which was signed by six countries in the world.
Veterans champion Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e!

How to assess the semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester semester
We asked Murat Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n, the training expert-student coach, how students should evaluate their half-year vacation.
For mid-year vacation students only; rest, entertainment, television and computer should not be thought of as time spent at the beginning.
Mid-year vacation is a very important opportunity to prepare for a new period of education and review the past.
A mid-year holiday called leisure time is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a semi-assessment list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
Be sure to enjoy this and spend a very productive semester period.
Now let’s talk about how to have an effective semester period for students preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because most of the questions from friends who prepare for the YGS-LYS exams come to us in this direction: “How should we assess this period, should we solve a lot of questions or do we have missing issues or should we solve them?”
To answer these questions, and to spend an efficient period, let’s first get into our writing with recommendations from friends who are preparing for the exam.
While the exam preparation process should be a process that starts from the 9th grade under normal conditions, we are trying to complete it more in the last 1 year, which forces us to spend the last year more efficiently, efficiently, and time more correctly.
In addition to the preparation of the final class, the student must also carry out his or her school-written studies together.
Even if the graduate student who has completed the school has entered and experienced the exam at least once (YGS-LYS), the year in which the graduate student will prepare for the exam again is critical for him.
Because most graduate students and their families see ‘O’ as their last chance of the year, and this creates greater stress.
Studying a lesson is a work that the student does not enjoy, only because he feels compelled, and therefore often ends up doing so, but it is completely a task for regular, habit-forming students, and it is always included in a plan as to when to do it.
We now have a half-year holiday ahead of us and we should consider it in the best way.
There must be a plan to ensure that we manage our time well.
Lessons learned during a half-year holiday:
Everyone should first of all make a plan according to their situation.
What has been done, what has been missing; the day, the week and the 15 days must be planned.
During this period, there should be both topic repetitions and question solutions.
At the same time, students who do not miss too much can also solve an average of 1-2 test exams.
Manage Your Missing Issues: Research shows that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to repeat it.
Students who make too many mistakes, especially on past issues, should put emphasis on their overall re-work.
Identify your missing topics first and plan the day, place the topic every day, and definitely handle them.
This planning will relieve you both academically and psychologically.
Make sure that you make the most of the mistakes you make when putting them into your plan.
Because in times to come, you won’t have such a long vacation period.
Make Question Solutions:
It is very important to solve the problem as much as to do it again.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do, but from the feedback we get through the question we solve.
Don’t forget to put a certain number of questions every day.
The number of questions you will be solving may vary depending on the work you will be doing that day; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions on a day when you are doing heavy work, but we still need to work on the question to a certain extent in order to see how much we learn about that day’s topic.
Solve Test Tests:
Another study you will do on a half-year vacation should also solve the test exams.
Even if the subjects are not complete, you can at least take the course test test solutions.
Let’s say you’ve handled the Turkish lesson in a big way; you can solve the tests of the Turkish lesson with 40 questions prepared.
And make sure you do it while you do it.
If you can solve the Turkish question in the first 60 minutes, you can solve your next goal in a few minutes, if possible.
Holiday and Hobby Plan:
Vacation means, of course, that it’s not just a matter of studying; you should also spend a few days on vacation, rest, and hobbies.
A vacation period that can only be spent studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
Therefore, there should also be special times that you will separate yourself into your plans.
Reading a book, watching TV, surfing the internet can be part of your plans, most importantly how much time you’ll spend.
I'm going to give a little advice to friends who say I haven't had a good time in my first period.
If; my first period didn’t go very well, I didn’t work very hard and if you say my shortcomings too much, this half-year holiday is a great opportunity for you too.
But first you have to decide and believe in it.
Turkey scored the most goals in the 2009–10 season between the 76th and 90th minutes of the football Super League.
Now you answer the question you asked yourself, the match is over, and you are going to the dressing room, or is the match still going on and there are many minutes left to score?
I don't think anyone wants to say "we're going to look at the next games," which is a classic comment used by a defeated football team coach or players.
All you have to do now is to leave the past and look in front of you, not to run.
If we're going to collect what we're saying:
1) First of all, make a half-year vacation plan,
2) Do it over and over again on the topics you know,
3) Dealing with your missing issues,
4) Fix the issue by solving the question,
5) Solve the test tests,
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Spend time with yourself, your hobbies and the things you enjoy,
9) Spend time with your family and friends,
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theater, concerts, tours, picnics, etc.)
'Kervan' has come a long way
With an average of 1,000 square meters of 45 stores, one of Turkey’s largest ‘home’ store chains, Kervan’s founder <0xC5><0x9E>inasi Demirel and his son Hasan have added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad, to Kervan’s composition.
With the recently completed operation of the trade swirl, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Still noting that there is no Kervan store abroad, <0xC5><0x9E>inasi Demirel said, "Now with Kervan, we will continue to do smaller shopping with Home Sweet Home."
He said, “The kervan will also be opened abroad.”
With the merger of Kervan’s <0xC2><0xA3>90 million worth of <0xC2><0xA3>50 million and Home Sweet Home in 2015, a retail chain of <0xC2><0xA3>140 million came out.
Kervan's total sales area of 45 stores in 35 countries is 45,000 square meters.
25 of the stores belong to the parent company.
There are about 500 employees in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries abroad and has a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Chairman of the Management Board of Home Sweet Home, which is producing, exporting and retailing with his partner Alev Pakten, said they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, "We are Mardinlili and entered this sector in 1998."
From the very beginning, with the support of Mr. Shinasi, we have produced a brand.
Mr. Shinasi is the 'TRT' of this sector.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step to the store by giving us his own Ak Center store.
Kervan and I were already working as strategic partners, not as rivals.
"Now there will be a very serious synergy with this merger," he said.
Kalayc<0xC3><0xAD>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu announced that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, including in the Middle East, and that they started exporting to China last month.
Kalayc<0xC3><0xAD>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, "We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed with a chain of 200 stores.
“After that, we will develop our small shop with Home Sweet Home as Kervan’s large store abroad,” he said.
Poroshenko sells its factory in Russia
Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, CEO of Roshen, told Liga.net news site that the plant was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, "Yes, we sold the factory."
"It's not going to sell out, but all the real buyers have suddenly disappeared," he said.
Regarding the price of the company’s factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, “We have determined it as about $200 million.”
Roshen, who produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and candy a year, is one of the world’s largest producers and belongs to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holding became Pladis abroad
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding merged the global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it bought under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met’s, Godiva, United Biscuits, and Country brands, a new $5.2 billion food giant was born, employing 26,000 people.
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker, Chairman of the Management Board of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, speaking at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, said: "To be a global company was our goal from the beginning" and added:
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker has released live sales of 335 million lira from Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now moving to become a global brand and global company in the field of biscuit chocolate candy business under the name of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding.
During this time, we developed packaging from retail real estate, personal care, and various industries in addition to chocolate candy.
We have 77 factories operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands and thousands of sales points.
<0xC3><0x9C>lker, who said that the entire Star Holding has created a “family of more than 50,000 people”, said: “Now that we look back at the possibilities in our family and focus on the main business of making biscuit chocolate, we want to be global in this field; we are reorganising for this moment.”
The Life Story of Sabri Bey, <0xC3><0x9C>lker's father
We re-evaluate our company, we re-organise.
We've divided the world into regions.
And we've shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tu<0xC3><0xBC>nc<0xC3><0xBC> is responsible for the Middle East, Africa and the Republics of Turkey.
Mohamed Elsarky is a representative of our global Godiva business as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for Britain, continental Europe and Africa.
Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker, who I can call a quality and innovation guru, will help me in the management of the business.
China, Russia, in part, will be the regions that we will newly establish and develop in South East Asia.
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker has sold shares in SAF GYO
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker, who continued his words: "We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite," "The name of our global company that we set up to achieve this is Pladis."
"Wherever you say Pladis invented it, there's actually no special mana of this name," he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Surya, we were inspired by the name of the Pleiades team of seven stars from the Latins who came to the country.
In other words, we have translated the country into a global one.
Vice President of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding Management Board Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker also stressed that by cooperating with laboratories in different countries, we “began to create synergy in innovation” and added:
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, bringing these teams together, and we have achieved certain synergies in our work on an AR-GE platform so far.
We have 27 R-GE centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
More than 300 AR-GE experts are working here.
Synergy studies have already started to produce results.
Digestives's (Nibbles) drake, which was produced in the <0xC3><0x9A>lker and will be exported to the UK, is produced in Silivri at the <0xC3><0x9A>lker chocolate factory.
Another synergy example: Brands are different but products are the same Country Crispy Crispy Crispy Crispy.
A cracker technology developed in the UK, i.e. Jacob's Crinklys product, was soon adapted to Turkey, and we have brought a nice taste to our country under the name of <0xC3><0x9A>lker Krispi Tart<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>.
Laviva, whom we all know very closely, met with consumers in America today.
The Call of Duty series has crossed the 250 million mark.
Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games, the series that has carved its name into the gaming world with golden letters, seems to be unforgettable for many years to come.
In particular, the newly announced sales figures are also in the direction of a lot of evidence that we need to find how legendary it is.
Activision, which holds the franchise rights to the series, has sold 250 million copies of its own sales by the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company, which shared the sales of the entire series, has since sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
We can’t be wrong if we say that a large part of this number makes up the Black Ops 3 game.
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was once again elected President
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was re-elected as President of the Ola<0xC4><0x9F>an Assembly.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who won the game of 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, became the re-elected president.
248 of the votes cast were invalid.
After the conclusion was revealed, the parties were in a joyful show.
The CHP had a total of 275 delegates.
The committee completed its work to meet at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
In the Swordsman's office, he summarized:
We'd like to play games here, say turkeys.
But the point we're in is not intoxicating.
There is an unmanageable Turkish truth.
The resulting atmosphere obscures all of this.
The reason for the Karamsar table is that they govern the country.
As CHPs, no matter where terrorism comes from, no matter how it comes from, we are against it.
Terrorism is a crime of humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done with wisdom, it is done with knowledge, it is done with vengeance.
Of course, let's fight, we want no one to bleed.
What is the difference between the photos in Syria and Lebanon and the photos in the southeast?
While sitting at the table, they made serious mistakes.
The blood of Akan is the responsibility of your tears, of all the dead.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terror, today there is a Turkey that returns to the blood lake.
Who is responsible for this?
Is our boss the taxi driver in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r?
What does Turkey pay for?
We will take part in the meetings sincerely about changing the laws of force, we will convey our thoughts.
We will not allow anyone to build a country on the basis of personal opinions.
I say, "Let's change the spirit of the striker."
Since they have explained the clear thoughts of this country, houses are being printed in the morning and taken into custody.
We also have aspects that we do not participate in, but people should be able to freely express their thoughts.
This dictator's disorder says, "The one who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state."
And I want to ask him, why didn't those who ate the state's bread and took advantage of the state's every opportunity to rob the state?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will always prepare for the fourth major revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will definitely bring a libertarian democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, whatever they do, no matter how heavy the cost, they will bring freedom to this country.
I'm making a clear call to you, Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
To hide behind the law of strike, the man who hid did not throw the mind of strike away.
You gave a superior service to the man who needed you.
What stroke are you talking about?
We're back to fooling people.
The party officials ranked the other 3 revolutions as follows: the end of the 1st Great Revolution in the Sultanate and the establishment of the Republic; the departure of a multiparty period from the one-party period during the 2nd Great Revolution; the transition of the 3rd Revolution to social democracy with B<0xC3><0xBC>lent Ecevit.
The president has his qualities, his duties.
In Article 103, the President is sworn in.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a man goes out and promises this, he will fulfill his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable for us.
The man with the dictator's disorder, what does honor and honor mean to you?
What do you mean by honor and honor, why did you take this oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
I want to know.
In a religious man, the concept of honor and honor is supreme.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of strike, but to condemn the law of strike.
They don't want the presidential system.
What kind of presidency; a bossy presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who orders one will do it for you.
Is it safe to work in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring democracy to freedom, the system works.
They call it a strike, but they've strengthened the law of strike.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, did not take part in the contest because he could not collect the signature of 128 delegates required for the candidacy.
Balbay, who can collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't run under current conditions."
Members of the party (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the members of the honorary board were present in the meeting hall, and the former CHP leader, Deniz Baykal, was seen sitting in the stands with the parties.
Instead of sitting in a separate place for his deputies, G<0xC3><0xBC>lay Reedici, a member of the stanbul parliament, came early and sat next to the place that had left for President K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Yalova MP Muharrem Ince's meeting with K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was also one of the topics discussed at the board meeting.
Fince explained to him that he was offered PM membership and that he did not accept it either.
However, from general central sources, there was a claim that the call came from Ince and that PM membership was not recommended.
According to a Twitter post, “Nobody can learn the content of the meeting from the Istanbul representative Ali <0xC3><0x96>zcan.”
And <0xC3><0x96>zcan said, "How can I know from two people's meeting?"
It's enough to say, "I've met you before."
The swordsman, he often applauded the press.
On the first day of the current "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood", the party assembly (PM) flagged the curtains.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu began working for the PM list as he went home after the board meeting.
While preparing K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s 100-person key list, current members of the MYK explain that they do not want to take part in the administration, Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karaka<0xC5><0x9F>, and Seyhan Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>du, who did not apply to the PM, once again called the 13 MYK members on the phone, where they told him that they were not.
It is noted that K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's 100-person PM key list could also indicate another restricted list.
In the declaration of the result of Article 21 adopted unanimously by the CHP Board, the removal of objections to the European Local Management Framework, which came into force with the DTK’s independence discussions, was called for an increase in the sharing of powers on the ground.
The announcement also included the goals of “the termination of the party state system”, “the establishment of a rule of law that can be held and accounted for”.
Vice-President Sel<0xC3><0xA7>uk <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F> of the Kurultay AK Party followed Idris Baluken of HDP and Ruhsar Demirel of MHP.
The <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F> and <0xC3><0x96>k Parti<0xC4><0x9F> left the hall after K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's harsh criticism of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
“I saw that the criticism was missing the dose, I couldn’t accept it,” he said.
Journalists arrested in the hall drew attention to the banner "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English with the banner "How to burn darkness in the light if I don't burn if you don't burn", which included photos of Can D<0xC3><0xBC>ndar and Erdem G<0xC3><0xBC>l.
The morning session began with Group Comment and Ahmet Kaya songs.
Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Baro President Tahir El<0xC3><0xA7>i, who lost his life in the armed attack, received the message sent to the board by his wife Turkan El<0xC3><0xA7>i.
Berkin Elvan's mother G<0xC3><0xBC>ls<0xC3><0xBC>m and father Sami Elvan also joined the board.
The section in which the sword-bearer said that democracy would have to be "death" was the most welcome part of the speech, at whatever cost it was necessary to pay.
So far, 34 ordinary, 18 extraordinary CHPs have gathered 52 stalls, the 53rd largest stall at Ankara Arena yesterday.
The attendance was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no doubt that the crowd was right.
The most exciting moment was the memory of K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's wife Selvi K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu entering the salon together with his wife Selvi K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Excitedly, the Sworddaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu couple continued to greet the salon.
There were no works of discipline seen in the AK Party institutions in the hall.
Even when the sword spoke, there was a great movement in the arena's field section.
Obviously, the CHPs who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling party leaders and journalists about themselves.
A CHP official tried to explain that the situation is not a bad thing, saying, "It's better than stringing up and sitting still than figurine parties like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union."
There is another difference between the CHP board, the AK Party or the MHP board.
Only the presidents speak at these parties.
In the CHP, it becomes a platform where party issues are also discussed.
As the number of parties that wanted to speak on the board yesterday grew too high, President Murat Karayal<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>i had trouble adjusting the time.
There was also a distance to the expression "The country is going bad" in the faces and languages, and to the comments "You're changing the way you're going with the table that's coming out of this room."
All the CHPs had a consistent and strong answer to the question of "what to do" while saying "something should do".
This has had a huge impact on the fact that no elections will be held in the next four years.
When we went to the Swordsman's chair, we also waited for journalists to answer the question "What should I do?"
The swordsman first answered the question, "What's going on?"
He drew attention to the issue of detained journalists, to what was done to academics, to what was happening in the South-East, to the fact that foreign policy had entered.
The CHP-related "unreligious party", "supports the parties", "is the party of the elitists" has long responded to the "Anatolian legends" about the party.
When it came to the "what to do" stage, he tried to put forth "strategy" instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that it could come with more justice with a democracy that is stronger than all these problems.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work at any cost until democracy is brought in."
“We will fight to the death for democracy,” he said.
One last note; it should also be noted that the CHP has addressed the issue of "organization" as of the 53rd constitution, and is now able to collect the constitution without problems.
Meanwhile, cards were printed for 900 journalists who were told to follow the board, but the participation of journalists in the hall was not at that level.
The Ankara representatives of media organizations were also not as willing as the AK Party institutions to follow the board.
The God of Selfishness
The claim, prepared by the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Republic Prosecutor General's Office on 3 of the 7 defendants arrested, was accepted as the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
On the orders and calls of the top level leaders of the PKK/KKK terrorist organization Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Istanbul, <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>rnak, Mardin, Mu<0xC5><0x9F>, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and A<0xC4><0x9F>r<0xC4><0xB1>.
In a statement, the head of the organization said that the calls for illegal action against young people and women are being made, that Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r’s forces are in the districts of Sur, Bandar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro, and that they are in the process of deploying to the public institutions and institutions,
We have been hit by a clash with ISIS.
The recent clashes between Syria’s D<0xC3><0xBC>den, Black Belt B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>d<0xC4><0xB1>ddin and the Fatih Army, which have joined forces with opposition groups in the Black Belt village of K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>zlu, continue to escalate.
The sound of weapons and aircraft fired during clashes between ISIL and the rebels near the border is also heard by Turkey.
Smokes rising from areas where explosions often occur were seen naked by Turkey, while security forces on the border line took intensive measures with armoured vehicles.
On the other hand, a ceasefire was opened at <0xC5><0x9E>ehit Mehmet Border Karakol, near Yavuzlu village of Kilis from B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>ddin village under the control of ISIS militants.
On top of this, under the terms of engagement, the soldiers responded to the area where the artillery fire was opened with buses and heavy weapons.
Russian warplanes reportedly launched an attack on the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
The six Syrians who were injured in the air bomb were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
Lotto has taken the rich.
The Robinson couple, who live in a small home worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about 1 billion TL) over a 29-year period, compared to a total of $528.8 million (1.6 billion TL).
The couple said, "Well, there's no guarantee of tomorrow."
John Robinson, who works in a chain store, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant alongside a dermatologist, said they would be in the lead on Monday despite being a millionaire.
The couple aims to pay home loan debt primarily with the money they earn and help their loved ones.
It was revealed that the big reward was divided into three.
iOS9: How to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
By going to the Settings app for the new operating system, you can tap "Gene" and select "Software Update".
When you are ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and install.
Some users experienced an issue after this installation and received an error message saying "Software update failed".
In order to overcome this problem, it is recommended that users wait for the system to load down or try to upgrade iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
It may also be erasing apps to make room for this — but by reducing the update, Apple has prevented it from happening, and it uses a special tool for reinstalling when some apps are finished and the process for it to be deleted.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or that it is next to a charging device so that your battery won’t run out.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow it to update, as the phone may stop halfway down the update.

At the same time, you should make sure you do everything you can before you start downloading; if something goes wrong, you should try to stop it and protect it. iOS 9 is a smarter personal assistant and comes with new features that speed up the operating system with new production features for iPad and fine-tune new features.
FedEx's revenue mixed, financial outlook will fall in 2016
For the past three months, FedEx has reported disappointing results, and the cargo giant has reduced its year-round profit forecast due to a decrease in demand for cargo services and an increase in costs for on-site services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
During this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
On Wednesday, about 2.5% fell in pre-opening operations 45 minutes before the opening gong.
FedEx Corp. said it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending in May, down 20 cents from previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on the research conducted by FactSet.
On January 4, an average of 4.9% will be valid, and despite high shipments starting in November of heavy or large packages, there seems to be a likelihood of a drop.
According to the company, cost cuts are expected to be higher, and earnings from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than in the previous year.
Fred Smith, president and CEO, said the company “has been performing solidly, especially in the face of weaker economic conditions than expected in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS, according to which UPS plans to take the same number as last year, 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers.
Over the three-month period ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share, Zacks Investment Research estimated that 12 analysts were left behind $2.44 at the $2.42 level.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
Last year, FedEx took a hit from the decline in international priority shipping, which caused revenue in the Express unit to stall.
However, the explosion in online shopping increased the results of FedEx Land Services.
In the last quarter, the revenue of land services increased by 29%, but the operating income was essentially halted due to large packages and high costs of internal insurance.
While high labour costs are falling in the cargo business, the express unit has seen high income due to high base rates.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed down 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the record high on June 11.
At the most anticipated meetings over the years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week that it was not time to raise the rate of interest almost once every ten years by spending two days around a 27-foot Honduras table.
The two-storey meeting room, located on one side of the central bank, will be an image of the wall of the United States.
This is a reminder that the Fed’s Women’s President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are keeping the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
There are two tasks that the central bank has taken from Congress: to top up U.S. employment and to keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Depression, the Fed’s leaders have admitted that it is a third unwritten slogan: financial balance.
And this third announcement could be a factor X in a decision too close to predicting whether or not the U.S. economy is ready to begin cutting off its unique short-term interest rate from the near-zero rate that is due to be announced on Thursday.
While most data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the latest trend in global financial markets can still drive attention on Fed officials by increasing the reference federal fund rates – even less than a quarter – by adding fragility.
“Clearly the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the ratio, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will provide them with enough reason to wait a little longer,” he said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, and that in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists that Bloomberg recently met were expecting an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to remain on hold with the main indicator, which shows only a 30 percent chance of an increase.
This situation could signal a decline in the stock market if policymakers do not ease the effect of another increase by promising that another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, “The rate of inflation was triggered by the Fed’s policymakers expecting them to hold steady this week.”
“It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise rates right now,” he said.
If the Fed had decided in this direction, “they would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts suggested that an increase in the rate could calm financial markets due to the rise of the fog curtain on when the Fed will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the verge of a 0.25-point increase this month, which would be a small step that would strengthen the U.S.’s recovery in the path to a slow tightening of monetary conditions.
Yellen said he expected this year's rate increase in spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals about the need for a more economic process.
Despite the slow pace of job creation in August, growth in the labor market has been steady this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years, approaching the level at which the Fed is fully employed.
Salary increases showed signs of correction.
And while the inflation central bank continues to watch below its 2% annual target, Fed politicians said it was a significant cause of the temporary impact of sharply falling oil prices.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy “can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the tightness in the labor market.”
But financial markets around the world began to shake after China’s currency devaluation at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industry index average fell below the record level in May by 16% due to fear that a slowing Chinese economy will pull global growth down.
When the market is now below almost 10% of Dow’s high level in May, it somehow bounced back.
For Fed policymakers, market volatility makes calculating the time when the interest rate will be increased even more complicated.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research partner at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said: "The past few weeks may have been a little narrowed in this meeting due to the lack of news about financial markets in the Chinese economy.
Now he predicts they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there’s almost no data in their hands to focus on the advanced history of developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s top concerns, so it should not have an effect on the process of taking black.
In fact, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could “reduce” the monetary recovery triggered by global market shocks.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can also be expected to consult with other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy, not only to keep track of developments elsewhere.
Wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.’s global chief strategy officer, Zachary Karabell, said the decision-making process was “a far more than science skill.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, V. President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that “the Fed has been overreacting to the unprecedented financial market movements linked to economic foundations.”
Lacker, who is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote and is pushing for an increase in rates, cited the 1998-99 ruling as an example.
“Despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth,” Lacker said, “the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to make a 0.75 percentage point cut in the index rate during three meetings.”
A year later, the Fed officials took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the UK Central Bank’s rate-setting committee, said, “The Fed should only put its financial balance sheet concerns at the forefront during major crises, as it did in the 2008 market meltdown.”
He said the last player doesn't approach that level.
You really don’t want to be afraid of going up a rate because markets are greedy, said Peterson, President of the International Institute of Economics Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not mention the financial balance, and I do not think they should be moving in this direction until this change.
Do you want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese neighborhood.
The market/depot was opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwantown.
The Sunday/Depot is a one-stop shop; it sells a large number of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
If you want to buy engine oil, there's even a car part.
The store can be huge and it can take an hour to walk all its corridors.
If your stomach is hungry during all this shopping, get food from LAX-C BBQ Exres.
The inside of the store is next to the (good, calculated) boxes, and there are a variety of take-out options.
What's in stock: Do you want something from Thailand?
It's probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold collectively.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat shelf is very extensive, so is the fish - the workers behind the counter are cleaning the fish and making fillets, even if you like they are frying.
There is a large freezer compartment in a large part of the store; there you can find frozen cabbage leaves, bitter cabbage and galangal, whole duck, fish, ground blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial foods and more.
Who is shopping: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
There are both shopping cars and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Found: Fresh monthong durian is right next to the exit stand.
Where: The store is located in the industrial section of Los Angeles between Chinatown and the City Center, just a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking space, sharing it with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, it is usually not difficult to find parking space.
Brazil’s Rio Grande Pediatric Society encourages healthy nutrition during the period of breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has resorted to a shocking method by including images of a milky child painted with unhealthy food images to explain the importance of healthy nutrition in the trials and breastfeeding processes for women.
Human milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provides babies with all the nutrients they need to be able to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to their increased energy requirements, it is recommended that pregnant women and new mothers increase their daily caloric intake to around 500 calories.
What’s more, according to new research, the dietary supplement that mothers need to take is not limited to just calorie intake.
According to a new study led by Texas Baylor College of Medicine professor Robert Waterland, pregnant women’s healthy diets have protected them against the development of tumors by affecting the genetic expression of their babies.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been shown to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's moves to Canberra to overthrow Liberal's leadership were unsuccessful in securing a rating increase for Today.
After the fall of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
The Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, interspersed between Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and the weekly international series, including Cancun.
As the distance problem doesn’t make much difference to Australian viewers, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 viewers in five cities, compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000) on Monday (317,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today is closing the deal with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Sunrise had an average of 318,000, compared to 330,000.
The difference at the beginning of the year was between 40,000 and 50,000.
To date, Sunrise has averaged 349,000, compared to today’s 314,000 figure in September.
This is the most interesting thing that happens in the morning.
Winds of change are far more powerful than Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was Erik Thomson, the star of the old Packed to the Rafters, the soft start of the 800 Words.
With the two children of a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside in New Zealand, the new drama has reached a very impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics have questioned Thomson's ability to perform a solo show without the star of the Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a sniffing "yes" response.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeating Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven mixed their night fortunes with two Follow-Australias.
The first half-hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00–17:30) reached an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half of the hour (17:30-18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory against Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, Australia’s first half-hour reached an average of 520,000 viewers, while that number rose to 720,000 in the second half.
The hot seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia's second night rating drop, he thought that the Hot Seat would give Nine a lead at 5:30 a.m.
Followed by Australia, a change was made to Mc Guire’s show, a Million Dollar Minute that didn’t brush its teeth.

The last three people think Single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Has the secret been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed who will win the Independence without knowing who.
The woman that Sam Wood would choose at the end of his solo program was in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell you who the last rose area is.
However, the day before three people fall to two, Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski are in control; they may have given a clue without knowing who the winner will be.
Sam Wood closed his mouth until the final on Thursday.
The three women explained why Wood was perfect in a lyrical language; they said they wanted to be his partner by emphasizing his sense of humor, his ambition, his family values, and his positive attitude.
But the answers to their question, “If not you, who should take Wood’s last laugh?” may include information about who will win The Bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the best candidate for Wood outside of themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows: “From the moment I got home, I felt that [Sarah’s] energy and Sam’s energy were right for each other, and I thought so throughout the program.”
Markoski added, "Sarah is very practical, it's very fun to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable when they are side by side.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood will be a very good match.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him think Wood was the "right person."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game – I’m totally connected to him now,” he said.
If it wasn't for him, it was mysterious when Wood was asked who to choose.
"I don't know if I can say that," he said.
"I love the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor will be broadcast on the Ten channel at 19.30 on Wednesday.

Jarryd Hayne had several options for where to start his NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle themselves moved to the United States, they showed a lot of interest in him, and many other teams approached him after last year’s impressive open training day.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches replaced Hayne because of his loss in the Australian rugby league performance, as he had won 20-3 against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed in this man and, recognizing Hayne another opportunity, played a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
After the game, Tomsula continued to show her true color in the dressing room.
Instead of humiliating the bells in front of the whole team, he gave them courage.
Tomsula also clearly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
Cam Inman, a reporter for the 49ers team, said Hayne was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey, the team's special coordinator, and advised him to forget about this fall and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesota Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball
This wasn’t what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base imagined for the first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen crouching out of the field after dropping the ball and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he couldn't think of a worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "That was just one of those things, you'll be sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also recalled Origin's first game of 2007 with the number-one rebound to Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted the pose on Instagram while holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will come together to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested in Siberia by gunfire.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was thrown in jail, handed over the oil company to Yukos, and the democratic side was cut short.
Four people have been killed by police in Nepal after plastic bullets hit protesters.
On Wednesday, an official said four people, including a four-year-old boy, had died as a result of police firing plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution in the country.
The incident took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief executive, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station and that some had fired stone and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper gas and opened fire on the air before using plastic bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It’s not clear why plastic bullets used because they’re known to kill, but usually a less deadly alternative, resulted in such a high death rate.
The conflict has been the latest of violent protests that have been going on for weeks across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the newly proposed constitution will highlight the political impact of the regions themselves.
The ethnic group of Tharus, who wants to establish their own states, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have lost their lives in violent clashes that have continued since August 10, including 11 police officers.
The four major political parties have agreed on the division of the country into regions in this history – an important but uneasy creative step for the preparation of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been governed by the central state for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have stepped up this process after the devastating earthquake that occurred in April and caused the deaths of thousands of people.
Lawmakers have been working on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new text will be held until Sunday.
NHC says the Cape Verde Islands are 60 percent likely to storm south
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said the Cape Verde Islands' wide low-pressure system south of 350 miles (560 km) is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said it was 60 percent likely of a tropical storm in the next two days.
Google Launches Donation Matching Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a donation-compensation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have fled war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google has announced its donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of a manager making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote her own personal experience.
“We had plenty of dark buses and train trips along the way, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe is growing, many families like my family are in need of help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that offer aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the Children’s Rescue Committee.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation to Google.com/refugeerelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest cause of which is the Syrian civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars, are also fleeing.

Weight loss surgery in patients with moderately obese diabetes can help
According to a new study, it may take at least five years for patients with type 2 diabetes to benefit from obesity surgery.
But it's too early to say whether moderately obese diabetics live longer than non-surgical patients after surgery to tell if they don't live.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in the new study on JAMA surgery and expert on obesity surgery, “it takes a long time for death rates to determine themselves.”
Weight loss surgeries use a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach, bariatric surgery, otherwise known as bariatric surgery.
These reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been done on people with advanced degrees of obesity, with body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, which is measured over the proportion of kilos, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
It shows that a person with a BMI of 25 or over is overweight, while those with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
BMI can be calculated from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan’s fully-grateful Min-Sheng Hospital compared two types of bariatric surgery performed in the treatment of moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007 – gastric bypass and tube stomach surgeries – the results of the experiment.
As of the end of the fifth year of the study, those who had surgery had been reduced from an average BMI of 31 to 24.5.
The BMIs of those who have had a stable, surgical out-of-diabetes treatment have remained stable around 29.
Diabetes is partially resolved in 36% of those who have had surgery, and 28% of those who have had surgery.
In the medical treatment group, diabetes was only fully resolved in 1% and only partially resolved in 2% compared to this.
Also, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were generally better in the “surgical intervention group.”
The researchers also showed blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, reflecting blood sugar levels over time in patients.
According to the researchers, hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%.
Post-operative haemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9% to about 6%.
In the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" with corrected A1c hemoglobin levels, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates, did not reduce the mortality rate within these five years.
The research team compared the findings in hand with these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, the group that had bypass surgery looking at the group that had tube stomach surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and similarly in A1c hemoglobin (3.1 to 2.1%).
While the study does not indicate a clear benefit of survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone, from Arizona Medical College-Phoenix, said it was valid data that the surgery extended the lifespan, according to a study conducted in more weightier patients in Sweden.
In this Swedish study, obese patients with bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years from another group with more traditional treatment.
Although this new study hasn’t shown what the benefits of surviving patients with surgery are, according to Blackstone, it’s relevant to the subject, and it’s a confidence booster for people under BMI 35.
The most vivid part of the article is also here, because the low BMI group says this surgery is safe, there has been no increase in the risk of death or kidney problems, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the issue of weight loss seriously with the patient falling below 27 to 30 BMI.
I think we waited long enough for people to take this matter seriously," he said.
I think it's really hard to reverse this after you've collected these genetic changes that make your bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama, who says Europe will not be able to host all refugees, added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the countries of the refugees.
At the beginning of the 10-day visit to the UK, the Dalai Lama spoke about the ongoing refugee crisis in the opening speech at the opening of the Ethical Affairs Centre in Oxford.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that the interests of humanity should be at the forefront of the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, however appreciated, he stressed that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis were insufficient in this respect.
In his speech, he said, “It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe.”
Although he appreciates Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, the Dalai Lama has said that this is only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to deal with several thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you should think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, basically through education,” he said.
We need to think about how to reduce death in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never been a solution to the problems.”
Speaking on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama said it was worth what George Bush did after the September 11 attacks, and that U.S. responses to violence launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush on September 11, I addressed my main health wishes and stated that the way to solve this problem was through non-violent means.
I know their qualities are well-intentioned but he used force himself and caused unexpected results," the Dalai Lama said.
4x increase in hand-held antiseptic intakes seen in children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in high-alcohol wet mandible intakes in 12-year-olds since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of cases of hand antiseptics seen in 12-year-olds in six children reported at the center rose from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN: “Children have been more resistant to these kinds of products, and unfortunately, there are some who are amongst them who will be urgently removed.”
He said some children drank hand-held antiseptics knowingly, and some did so to influence their friends or in a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teens who drink antiseptics for cheap drinking.
It has been reported that some adolescents mix the antiseptic mixture with mouthwatering, which contains alcohol, to achieve a more firm interior.
Young children may have antiseptic odors that attract.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of the more attractive comers (hand antiseptics) are smelly.
There are hand antiseptics that are extremely attractive to children with herbs, grapes and orange aromas.
Where hand antiseptics come from, between 45 and 95 percent contain alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few yeasts can cause alcohol poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, the head of the poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, he is "highly concentrated alcohol," according to the Kansas City-based Fox 4 television.
You can’t leave a couple of whiskey glasses in the middle, but people leave these hand-held antiseptics in the middle, which is an easy way to get a lot of alcohol for kids.
Recently, Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old who consumed only four strawberry-scented hand antiseptics at school, was urgently removed for treatment.
The rate of alcohol in his blood was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency services doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta who was interested in him, which was two times the legal limit for alcohol in an adult.
Nhaijah could not utter the words and could not walk when he came to the emergency room.
Rithey reported that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under surveillance overnight in a separate children's hospital despite any signs of brain injury.
In a statement to CNN, Mother Ortoria Scott said it was "very scary".
It could've been murderous for my kid.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to briefly keep the contact of antiseptic mandalas in contact with the skin and to take children to places where they could not reach.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been found to be associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of ingestion of hand antiseptics containing an unexplained toxic substance.
Health officials have argued that the substance in question may not be ethyl alcohol, as stated in the list of ingredients, but may be methyl alcohol, which has a deadly effect.
In January, three fourth-grade students from New York’s north had conspired to poison “bad-hearted” teachers in order to “place anti-bacterial products around the class,” according to police reports.
Since the teacher is highly allergic to hand antiseptic, it is forbidden to use it in the classroom.
This plan, which has been passed before the police, has been described as a "empty undertaking" and has proposed a disciplinary punishment for the school administration.
You come to Samanthara too.
Robin van Persie, who watched Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e’s THY Europa League match with Lokomotif Kuban, teamed up with Udoh, Vesely and Melih at the end of the match.
Van Persie, who had a hot chat with Udoh, his fan, said, "I'm here to watch you."
You and your friends will be watching my training.
He said, "I'm waiting for you at Samanthara."
The two sides are innocent.
How humanistic I am today.
I want there to be no deaths.
But what is possible!
This world is evil.
Don't be fooled.
There is death in destiny.
It hurts too.
And the alien invasion.
And the lightning strike.
Sometimes it's a giant space shuttle.
Maybe a meteor.
I'm not saying there's no death.
I'm not saying let's throw away our signature.
Let's hear our reaction.
Let's say, bitches, don't answer!
Our humanity is magic.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
But he's not ashamed, damn it!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray Ince in the Sur district of <0xC5><0x9E>arnak.
It's been three months.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
On January 3, in Silopi, they killed Joseph the Rainer.
I think he was running away from aliens.
They searched for him when he was looking for a safe place.
He had a wife with him.
A day later, in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, they killed Angel Alpayd<0xC4><0xB1>n at the breakfast table in Little Actar<0xC4><0xB1> Street.
A day or two later, Sema <0xC3><0x87><0xC4><0xB1>ng<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu burned down the Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students ran away one by one.
On January 10, three men were left dead in Hazreti Huseyin Mosque in <0xC5><0x9E>ehit Harun Boy Square, where the kape mob was attacked.
Two days ago, three children lost their lives in <0xC3><0x87><0xC4><0xB1>nar district of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r.
An unidentified object weighed 1 ton of explosives in the lives of these little ones.
There were others who died, and those who were injured.
Who's guilty?
Felec, of course.
Two sides.
No, it's not a party with a cappuccino.
The two sides are innocent.
The killer's out there, shaking his hand and looking at our face and laughing.
Some people try to get their attention in a different direction.
While the killer is in front of us, he creates opportunities to run away from the killer instead of signaling to the killer.
The killer's getting dirty.
He's hiding it.
Even after losing his sight, he tells her that he doesn't actually have a fault.
The aspects of the fight we've been fighting for the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone's gonna cut the circle of fire around us and want us to burn.
Someone's trying to stop it, and more to put out the fire around us.
Someone's in trouble with breaking down, getting wet.
You're after someone, you're after the producer.
There are those of us who have seen all kinds of war in our region.
The Civil War.
The interstate war.
The Mezheplar War.
The war of revenge.
And they've got tasherons.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Hand-blooded robbers.
In different names, in different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each and every one of these.
He's fighting, and that's why he's in the mood for a joke.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your fate...
They did not take refuge in traitors, they took refuge in white cloth
Members of the PKK, a terror organization that is stuck in a corner between the area, find the fence mixed with white flags and fleeing the citizen.
The security forces are using GBT to prevent leaks.
With the peace and democratic operations that began on 23 July, the active force in the districts of the village and across the border, which suffered a major blow, is also being broken.
According to information obtained from sources in the area, the weapons and ammunition depot of the large-scale organization in Silopi was seized and rendered ineffective.
Some of the citizens fleeing the PKK’s attacks are moving away from police and military checkpoints with white flags in their hands.
Terrorists, who were stuck between the streets and could not find a point of escape, also began to flee with a white flag.
Security units are conducting a general information gathering (GBT) survey of the individuals they suspect.
It was noted that a PKK terrorist in Silopi was mixed with the white flag among the people, but when he realized that he would be caught during the GBT interrogation, he tried to escape and was rendered ineffective.
COMMANDORS REQUIREMENTS
From carefully monitored districts in the area, Cizre also hit the army and police terror organization.
It is reported that the cemetery where the militants were washed has been largely cleared.
The client teams, formed by the police and the Gendarmerie Special Operations Units, left their positions in command by completing their duties.
Commanders stationed in the Yafes Square are also taking action to prevent the terrorists from being resuscitated.
In other districts, it was noted that the security in the neighborhoods where the client teams cleared the terrorists would be left to the commanders.
Police and soldiers 1 ton of baklava
The Municipality of Cizre, Sur and Silopi, serving in difficult conditions, sent 1 ton of torch to special forces police and soldiers.
The mayor, Hasan Kara, said they had been cursed by the terrorists, "May the Lord give strength and strength to our security forces, who protect their country and their nation, by serving in harsh conditions."
He said: "We ask for mercy from Allah for our witnesses, and we ask for urgent healing for our guests."
The cynics told us the night of terror.
The people of C<0xC4><0xB1>nar responded greatly to the attack.
Most of the houses around the lodges where the explosion took place became unsatisfactory.
Emin Altun<0xC3><0xA7>, one of the residents of the area, said: "My son was injured, but we couldn't leave the house because there were gunshots.
We were able to take my son to the hospital in an hour.”
Sabiha <0xC3><0x96>zcan, who stated that his wife was injured, said: "When my wife was sleeping in the room at the crash, she was injured.
He came up to the door.”
He was in the blood.
"I'm damning what happened," he said.
14 people were killed on the road
A bus carrying skiers from Japan's ski areas in Karuizawa was derailed.
14 people were killed in the accident, and 27 others were injured.
Authorities reported that the bus had hit the barrier by falling from a height of about 3 meters.
It was reported that there was no ice on the road, and an investigation into the accident was initiated.
He sold the 50-kilometer concrete road!
Alexander Protopopov, the director of a prison in Russia’s Koni region, was arrested on charges of selling 50-kilometer-long concrete roads on the highway.
Between 2010-2015, it was revealed that Protopopov obtained a profit of $80,000 (243,000 TL) using this method of removing and selling part of the concrete lined with the highway using his position.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7,750 per 15 million lire
A woman named Viola Colombo, who lives in Venice, Italy, won the right to convert 15 million lire into euros in an old box she found on the open auction site from e-Bay.
The area of Colombo, which he thought was a few euros in 2014, had been turned back by the Central Bank, which wanted to convert the former Italian currency lires into euros.
Colombo, which the court has found is entitled to receive 7 thousand 750 euros (about 26 thousand TL).
Apply to UNESCO for a non-female island
Japan applied for entry to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 2017 of Okinoshima Island, which is only allowed to print men's feet because of the temples on it.
But the priest class on the island is opposed to this decision with concern about ‘Tourist coming’.
Saudi Arabia has not given up on T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK
The Minister of Science, Industry and Technology, Ikri I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k, stated that a new agreement was concluded with the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Agency (T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK) on the implementation of the 6th Arabist Imagination Analysis and Recognition System (BAL<0xC4><0xB0>ST<0xC4><0xB0>KA) to sell the second batch to Saudi Arabia.
The light was found in the explanations about BALISTICA developed by TUB<0xC4><0xB0>TAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
The Light, which explains that the weapons captured in the events of the system, the bullet core and ballistic examinations of the trenches are comparable to the data found in the central database, thus eliminating the problems experienced by ballistic experts when examining the trenches and ammunition cores.
The light indicated that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information could be questioned by hiding together thanks to ballistics.
Noting that one of the most important features of ballistics is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more detail and less error, the Light is able to quickly make the decisions that the ballistics expert will make thanks to the innovations brought by the system.
BALISTICA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project"
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k noted that Bal<0xC4><0xB1>st<0xC4><0xB1>ka met all the criteria in the success metrics and that it received a full note from the Directorate of Security, Ankara initially covered the entire Turkey of the system, which was established in 10 separate regions.
As a result of the success of the system, Light recalled that BAL<0xC4><0xB0>ST<0xC4><0xB0>KA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project" carried out with Saudi Arabia and that its establishment in 6 regions was successfully completed in 2013.
In light of the fact that Bal<0xC4><0xB1>st<0xC4><0xB1>k has signed a new agreement for the sale of the Bal<0xC4><0xB1>st<0xC4><0xB1>ka to Saudi Arabia for a second party, Suba-2, which is a continuation of Suba-2, will serve in Saudi Arabia with an agreement covering the development and establishment of additional 8 systems.
The size of the bus found the fossil of thyme
It was reported that the pre-historic sea turtle found 10 meters in length and 3 tons in weight.
The length of the skull was only 1.6 meters.
The researchers published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research, which gave the genus the name "Machimosaurus rex".
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, the head of the paper, said the fossil, estimated to be 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus."
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said the giant saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain in at least a certain region at the time."
Paleontologists have explained that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile living in the sea, was hunted by laying a nest in lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is believed to be the "Sarcosuchus emperor", which lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago, and can reach 12 meters in length and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The writer Ece Temelkuran's first 1996 book 'The Head of All Women Is Mixed' was adapted into the theatre by the Aysa Productions Theatre of the same name.
Selen U<0xC3><0xA7>er directs the game, which is played by Sea <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turktan Source, Kadir <0xC4><0xB0>rmik and <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem S<0xC3><0xB6>nmez.
U<0xC3><0xA7>er’s first-ever text-writing and management experience, called ‘Poz’ and ‘Dry Hard’, questions the confusion in the minds of women.
The game met with an audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The game starts with the radio theater.
In the dark, a sound that takes us to past years...
Then the curtain opens.
She stood by the window, a woman jumping down.
It's clear who he is and why he committed suicide by interfering with his neighbors.
A MEKTUP BIRAKIYOR
'Ebru Uysal', a popular writer, revived by the Sea Chakra.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There's stuff that's been in there since you were a kid.
Not to taste the father’s love, to exclude him in his student life, to think that his only passing childhood, wrong relationships, are not understood; he has brought him to this point.
He left a letter behind and decided to commit suicide, but he couldn't jump out of the window.
Because the mysterious woman 'Perran' (<0xC5><0x9E>ebnem S<0xC3><0xB6>nmez), who sits opposite the apartment with the maid and clean cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), is talking about her.
They approach the situation like a normal, normal process.
The woman is still tense and unable to jump into the concentration.
The conversation between the three, when the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Ipek Turktan Source) who cleans his house, takes part in the event, turns into a well-rounded affair.
Meltem, who approaches the situation in a more na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and sincere way, is unable to sing himself when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt is gaining a different dimension with the real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir <0xC4><0x8C>ermik) entering the girl's house with the spare key.
The singer's 'Meltem's lies to the press make things worse.
The game also features the song "The Girl on the Street" by Nazan Pencel.
BUNALIM GULD<0xC3><0x9C>R<0xC3><0x9C>S<0xC3><0x9C>S<0xC3><0x9C>
For the first time, U<0xC3><0xA7>er managed to ensure the pace and flow of the game.
The game's comedy load is drawn from Turkey with Zeynep Kankonde and <0xC4><0xB0>pek.
The types in your cartoon that the two of you play; the necessary mimics make the audience laugh with the necessary replicas.
While <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem S<0xC3><0xB6>nmez conveys the experience of the years very well to the stage, the Seahawk also shows a convincing performance reflecting the depressive mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik, who talks about Tolga Steelik’s award-winning film with her performance in ‘The Complex’, also successfully accompanies these four women.
The one-sided game, which is described as a bulging comedy, promises to laugh without getting confused.
Most of the beautiful words that come out of the mouth of 'Perran', played by Shebnem S<0xC3><0xB6>nmez, are as follows: They read my <0xC3><0x87>alakalema; they see my <0xC3><0x87>alakalema; they live, they see my <0xC3><0x87>alakalema.
All the children thought of dying once to punish their mother and father, and for some reason they were always crying at the end.
The woman hangs in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
A woman is always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with some sort of abandonment.
I have to put my hands in my pocket, sometimes I can't stand the things that are out of my pocket.
People wonder where they're going to put their hands.
Surprised, our hands are multiplying.
People who talk behind what they don't understand, and pretend.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women's heads are confused because they're confused.
You have a chance to live because you can't die.
'Long live the kefir consumption'
Can be safely consumed at any age
The main ingredient that does not stop counting health benefits is milk, but the more beneficial miracle food from milk is one of the foods that kefir can safely consume at any age, the Expert Dietary P<0xC4><0xB1>nar Rule En<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>, which states, "It is more nutritious than yogurt, because the vitamin B and the essential mineral
It is also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It is also a good source of phosphorus.
The kefir, which also has a tok holding feature, does not lose weight at the same time.
“The nutritional value is quite high and my digestion will be an easy drink,” he said.
The Third Deva
Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and women who go into menopause can consume kefir without any hesitation, the Expert Dietitian P<0xC4><0xB1>nar Rule En<0xC3><0xA7>, “Kefir is basically a local drink made in the Caucasus.”
But now he's starting to announce his name to Earth.
The secret of youth, long and healthy life, kefir is almost everywhere.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is also kefir.
Friend of the guts
This unique drink, which does not end in counting the benefits, is a friend of the intestines.
In our intestines, there are 1.5-2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups because they are beneficial and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called ‘probiotic microorganisms’.
The activities of probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when consumed sufficiently, prevent the adhesion and spread of harmful microorganisms in the intestines to the intestinal wall.
Deterioration of the balance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive tract should be maintained by proper nutrition.
For this, we need to consume enough probiotics.
It eliminates these problems in the gut.
Kefir is the nutrient that contains the most effective probiotic bacteria, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on strengthening the gut system.
It allows beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to multiply and be beneficial in a healthy way.
In regular use of kefir, the intestines work, the intestinal disorders are eliminated, the fats are reduced and there is a healthier digestion.
A healthy gut system means a healthy and diseased body.
"Inflammation, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, which are also well-deserved, also help babies to get more quality vitamins and minerals from food, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition," he said.
He wants to continue where he left off.

Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>'s other goaltender, Genk Tosun, scored 3 goals in the first half of the league against Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurdu and made his first hat-trick in his professional career.
He has won 12 of the last 15 matches.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> has won 12 of his last 15 matches in the Super League.
In the league, the black-and-white team, who won one victory and defeat in the first 2 weeks, left the field with victory in 12 of the next 15 encounters, while in the other fights they won 2 together and a defeat.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> scored 19 points with 6 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats in 9 innings.
“Father” and “Faithful Face”
The Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>-Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurdu match will face the most goalscoring teams in the Super League this season and the most goalscoring teams.
Black and white, who scored 41 goals in the first half of the season, were the league’s top goalscorer.
Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyur, who scored 36 goals in the 17-week period, was one of the two teams that ate the most goals in the league, with Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehirspor, who shared the last line of the score.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>, who played between the two teams in the first week of the season and had a 7-goal stage, defeated his opponent 5-2 on the pitch.
Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurd<0xC4><0xB1> Technical Director Crisis
Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurd<0xC4><0xB1>, who could not complete the first half of the Super League where he wanted, experienced a technical director crisis between the circuits.
Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurd<0xC4><0xB1>, who completed the first half under the management of B<0xC3><0xBC>lent Korkmaz, left the road with a 48-year-old technical man on the day of the start of the intermediate camp.
Hakan Kutlu, who was brought to the head of the red-lacivers instead of the fearless, only one day remained at the head of the team he had previously worked on.
In Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurd<0xC4><0xB1>, where H<0xC3><0xBC>seyin <0xC4><0xB0>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F>kan was elected president of the club, the extraordinary general board between the circuit was made, and the post-conference technical director Nurullah Sa<0xC4><0x9F>lam came to an agreement, but the 50-year-old driver was only at the head of the team for two days.
Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurd<0xC4><0xB1>, as Nurullah Sa<0xC4><0x9F>lam has not yet been able to reach an agreement with a new name, will face Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> without a technical director.
Emotions from the Little Students
Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r's headquarters, Sur district, sent letters to police and soldiers in the region for moral purposes from children in the west.
Start with 75 Aksaray.
Istanbul West Ata<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Nature Science High School and Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Ata<0xC3><0xA7>a<0xC4><0x9F> Middle School students, including Year Republican Primary School, started working as coordinators.
As a result of these studies, students in schools suppressed the choreography they created for chocolates in the shape of a moon star, and then drew close to a dozen letters of poetry and painting.
The children later sent their work to the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate.
Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate has set up an exhibition table on the work done by children in the west as a coordinator.
The exhibition, which was set up in the new building of the Ministry of Security, was dedicated to the work of the students.
The exhibition was visited primarily by police officers and citizens who served in the building of the Directorate of Security.
It inspired readers to read each other’s meaningful writings and with the letter in which the poems were written.
A student writing a letter about the operations in the Central Sur district found in his letter, "Our beloved police officers in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r are grateful for the sacrifice you have made to protect innocent people in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r."
It was learned that the show will run until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who was occasionally criticized for her policies on refugees, was given the name of a refugee baby.
The 26-year-old Memun El Hamza and his wife Tema El Havar, 21, who managed to reach the German city of Duisburg by fleeing the war in Syria, gave their first children the name "Angela Merkel".
Tema El Havar, speaking to the German press, said: "We are grateful that we are here.
We put the name Angela Merkel on our daughter to show this.”
Father Memun El Hamza spoke in the form of "Germany became like a mother to us."
It's the second 'Merkel'.
The baby Angela Merkel was found to have been born on December 27.
According to reports published in the German press, the health of the little Angela Merkel, who was born at a weight of 3 kilograms 300 grams and a height of 55 centimeters, is good.
Last year, a Ghanaian refugee gave her daughter the name Angela Merkel, and some refugees opened "Merkel Ana" banners to support Merkel.
U.S. Consumer Confidence at 7 Months Summit
According to university data, UMICH rose by 0.7 points compared to the end of December, to 93.3.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Richard Curtin, director of consumer research at Michigan, said in a statement: “Consumer confidence has moved its rise to the fourth month as expectations for future economic growth improve.”
“Individual funding expectations have also generally maintained the highest level since 2007 due to the weakness in inflation,” he said.
In the statement, it was also placed in the forecast that consumer optimism will now depend on inflation continuing to remain exceptionally low.
UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance since 2004 with an average of 92.9, is determined by the results of a survey of 50 questions with at least 500 people each month.
Super Loto Results
The results of the Super Loto were clear with a draw by the National Pijango Authority last night.
For 5 weeks, the Super Loto results were expected with interest and excitement.
The Super Loto, which is close to <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, did not return with six in its January 14 draw.
In Super Lotto, he spent 8 million 734 thousand liras a week with hopes.
Here are the Super Loto results, the winning numbers of the week and the list of bonuses...
The winning numbers in the Super Loto 430th week draw were set to 1, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 27.
14 January 2016 When he did not go out with six in the Super Lotto draw, he transferred 8 million 734 thousand 19 liras to sixty-three dry bonuses a week.
The amount of the bonus at the Super Loto draw is expected to be about 10 million lira next week.
According to Super Loto results, 5 and 202 people with 5 will receive 3,132 pounds twenty-four, 4 with 10,262 people with 10,66 pounds twenty-five pounds, 3 with 181,612 people with 6 pounds forty-five pounds.
Putin is lying about what he's doing.
While Russia is preparing to recognise the status of "can do business with Russia" to Turkish companies in the event that the services offered by Turkey cannot otherwise be met, the Russian Tour Operators Association has also made a statement that "Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculates that the dismantling of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft of "Exclusive conditions" concerning Turkey to the Russian government.
According to the draft, published in the Russian Federal Regulation, it is expected that Turkish companies and their companies will be allowed to do business with Russia even if they need to enter the penalty area.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources outside Turkey or in cases where domestic production will bring serious additional costs, Turkish companies and companies will be able to benefit from the products and services.
In this category, which Turkish-language goods and services will be included will determine the karmic commission to be established in partnership with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
Thus, it will be possible to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia by electing bureaucrats.
Again, according to the same document, private companies with state organizations in Russia will have to prove to the commission that the work they will do with Turkish partners is not reasonable.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government, a snippet of Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
The Russian Tour Operators Union also said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
The statement said: "Despite the advice of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to not go to Turkey, our citizens have started to look for a formula to organize their holidays alone."
The number of posts on social networks on the Internet "The most practical and cheapest way to spend a holiday in Turkey" is growing like a scream.
The most common suggestion is to make a hotel reservation online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the price of oil falling below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
Medvedev said: “It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought that oil would fall to $30.
With this move, it seems impossible for the budget to be implemented in its current state," he said.
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
After the plane crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that economic sanctions would deepen even further.
In those days, our signers, who tried to go in order to get used to Russia, our Thy staff is officially dragging Chileans at the border gates.
Turkish goods are being dumped in customs subject to controls that will not come to mind.
It's only been a month, and yesterday Nerdun Hacio<0xC4><0x9F>lu reports from Moscow.
One or the other, the punishments are a softening.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era where the economy is so globalized, your efforts to close the border with the methods of a century ago are no longer destroying the political struggle to turn into an economic war.
We are still writing news about Iran and how the economic embargo, which has been in place for years, has raged.
A friend like Russia and Turkey seems to have a lot of friends, but the two neighbouring countries, which are not so much, are actually in need of each other.
It is not technically possible to break these two countries, which are associated with one another on such a night, with the tourist, with the entrepreneur, with the customer.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries can get into each other’s country.
It is best to have a political discussion at the table before the creation of the new Reza Zarrab (Riza Sarraf) and settle it there.
Without infecting the economy...
Hotel attack in Burkina Faso: 20 dead
Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, has been reported to have killed at least 20 people in a bomb-laden car attack on Splendid Hotel.

Terrorists set fire to school in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r
According to the information obtained, the incident took place in the 1007th Street in the central Bindar district of Yunus Emre Mahallesi.
A group of masked terrorists, throwing molotov cocktails at Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School at 7:30 p.m., fled after setting the building on fire.

Fire crews arriving at the school after security was taken, extinguished the fire without covering the entire building.
Then, while police teams were investigating the location of the incident, multi-faceted work was started to catch the fleeing terrorists.
On the other hand, some police officers at the scene were helping journalists get a picture, while a policeman was trying to stop journalists who wanted to get a picture.
ATM thieves took over the fence
Police teams from <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Security started working on a complaint that some people had withdrawn money from their accounts and spent money by copying bank card information.
The police, who identified the files of the incident as M.M.G (43) and R.O (32) as part of the investigation, said the suspects copied the citizens' card information with the help of "card copy order" and "mini camera" that they placed in ATMs in different parts of Turkey.
The suspects who learned the card's passwords were found to be dealing with these cards.
With the operation, the suspects were taken into custody.
Teams looking at the M.M.G. and R.O’s knee-high computer have captured a large number of videos from the mini-camera system set up to capture the passwords of citizens who trade in ATMs, indicating that the suspects had been gone for a short while to catch them.
It was also revealed that the hostages obtained an unfair profit of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 through the copying process they did on 15 different ATMs in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir.
The suspects, who were sent to justice after their security operations, were arrested.
Officials have warned citizens to regularly check account movements against such incidents and to make hand-wraps at ATMs during the password entry.
The Netherlands: Esad Lahey to be tried
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Lahey.
Koenders, speaking at a conference in Lahey, said he was responsible for the refugee flow.
Koenders, who pointed out that it would not be possible for peace to come to Syria as long as Assad was in power, said:
Assad needs to be tried at the UCM in Lahey.
Someone with so much blood in their hands has to face the court.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee flow we are currently facing.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving office anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs help in this regard as well.
Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz protests
In the 59th minute of the match with Medicana Sivasspor, the protest grew when Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz failed to reach the pass goal Sneijder wanted to give.
Then he turned his back on those who were in a hurry to get their hands on him.
Then the reactions increased, and when each ball came to the player's foot, the protest whistles were heard.
Then some of the tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz and protested against his supporters, who were reacting to their own players.
Then a large part of the tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz.
Winner: There is No Inconsistency in Celtic
While Deila will admit that the Hoops are in a bad place and will overcome this, Griffith doesn't care about the inconsistencies in Celtic.
The Battle of the Hearts, with Warburton's traction against the punishment given to Neilson by the SFA and the January signings that broke the Team's unity
Leader Don's made a five point difference with Celtic
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty shootout brought Aberdeen to a rightful victory over the Dons at Pittodrie against Hamilton, and gave the Dons the opportunity to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about his words of inconsistency
In Celtic, Griffith's words, which create a code of incompatibility, put it in the opposite direction, implying that he and his teammates were in no way forced under an increased sense of observation as they prepared to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I'm in the canyon where the players are impatient for it.
The absence of the title race of the Scots also bore the soul of the Dutchman Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former international player of Dutch football Ronald de Boer says Dutch football enthusiasts have lost interest in Celtic because they don't have any competition with Rangers.
De Boer, an Ajax ambassador, said: “In Holland they no longer give the summaries of Celtic matches, why?”
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They talk to each other while they talk about the teams, they take care of it.
The tension in the old team's matches was high and those who wanted to watch those matches were not just Scots.
I swear I'll fix it, Deila.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss said he would return to the opposite direction.
The defeat against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and then the Champions League immediately after the farewell followed the losing match against Aberdeen, who is now a five-pointer in the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad days in the past, and we'll be back again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very imaginative, and I know that a lot of people end up angry or sad.
We are in the same situation – but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January Transfers
Despite his comments that he set some January transfer targets just a week or two ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is shy of signing, insisting he doesn't want to break Ibrox's squad.
Former Brentford teacher said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in this summer, there’s a pre-season period where you’ll get used to them, which we’ve seen in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players to what you really need can do a lot more harm.
Celtic Michu on Retirement Targets
From Swansea forts, Michu connected with Celtic at the transfer window, and cleared the forecasts that he might retire when his contract with the Eagles was over.
When he was 29 years old, he experienced unbearable pain from a troubled ankle and found no way to leave Galler in the summer.
Hearts prepare for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 ahead and then lost 3-2, turning everything upside down after the defender's red card - Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on what he says, he insists: “I never questioned the unity, I didn’t comment on the performance.”
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
Attacked Hibee was outraged when he said a song featuring aggressive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in Tynecastle at a bar in Edinburgh's Roseburn area, just before the Edinburgh derby.
"It was a derby match and it was the heat of the moment," the attacking player added, adding: "I can definitely say that from now on I will not go to Tynecastle except to play with Celtic.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that Dundee United’s management team will fix things – but they accept that the downturn on the pitch should end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will make the children ready to be put back on the road," Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "crazy win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness, thanks to Aberdeen's first penalty in the first half of Adam Rooney, admits they have to be held hopelessly against Hamilton Accies in the league to see Celtic's top-seven victories on top of five points.
McLnnes said: “There is no team that wins anything in the middle, whether it’s cups or leagues, without winning the game in this way.”
As unemployment rates in the UK increased, the rates among Scots remained the same.
The number of unemployed people across the UK rose to 1.82 million in Scotland from 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people rose to 1.82 million.
According to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than 5.5 per cent in the UK.
On the other hand, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, and the number of people currently employed remained 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by 74.0% – this figure is above the average of 73.5% in the UK.
Scottish Minister of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a full year since Scotland decided to remain a part of England.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen growth in employment in the Scottish labour market and a decrease in unemployment.
Why I Witness a Murder in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch the murder of a man due to a late legal intervention in the coming hours.
I hope not, but if I do, I'll sit in Richard Glossip's death chamber surveillance gallery in Oklahoma State Prison while he's being executed with a lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and no matter how shocked I was, I accepted.
As the day drew near, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to follow up on executions in America, and since there are more practices than there are available, a terrible lottery emerges when deciding who to choose.
Oklahoma dropped its media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will watch their emotions before they get caught.
I can't do this.
I’m going to sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have developed a relationship with him over the past few months as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The authorities in the prison said I would not be a witness or a journalist, so I would not be given pens and notebooks to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoman journalist on Twitter accused me of reversing my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, gain access.
I complained to him.
He also admitted that he could “bring it in a better language,” but he still thinks what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip, I don't agree with some of the things I say and write.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could get me off the witness list whenever he wanted.
But an international reporter also wants to be there and write them down.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public will help counteract the death penalty.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you would like to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I won't tell you all the details here.
I have no idea for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death is enough to make himself a partner in crime.
But I still believe he's not guilty of the murder.
I don't think there's enough evidence to justify a death penalty.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm gonna watch his death from this perspective.
I can't really pretend to be objective.
You can look at the other reporters there.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impressions you'll get from watching the death of a man you like killed unnecessarily.
Man Convinced of the Canning River After Police Squash
Canning Vale police officer remained dry while convincing the man out of the Canning River.
The allegation of escaping from the police car behind a man from Perth ended with an effort by a police officer "to gently convince him to come back to shore" in shallow and muddy water.
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for an unauthorized entry into Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man entered the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
But he didn't get very far.
"Senior Deputy Commissioner Shandel Castledine was standing in the water himself and said, 'I'm not going to go out, come get me,'" he said.
Police Major Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, “Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape.”
Champion football player Ben Cousins sets a lasting example in his mind.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape from a police alcohol control and set out to swim the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but the local people were inspired to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for a joke.
Peter Moody claimed that the priests were spying on him and threatened to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria’s heroes were trying to prepare a draft in their hometowns last year and threatened to leave the race immediately.
Racing targeted Victoria’s scouts and union department and said they were running a personal campaign against her to leave Lady Tatai out of the race in their final feeding for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media he was always trying to do the best in the race, and told Business Leader that he found himself in a state of strength he couldn’t explain himself when he gave a positive result in cobalt.
He said he didn't want to "look like naked grapes" when he bit his tongue for 18 months.
“I wasn’t going to say that and shut it off for a long time, but sometimes you get very angry and everything happens all of a sudden,” Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you show a reaction and you fold to its results, and I will fold to the results of what I said.
When I go home tonight, I'll sleep comfortably.
I want to walk my head straight and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start to think I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be running anymore.
If so, I'd wonder what I'd do with my license.
Earlier in a racing.com interview, Moody had blown up a bomb that accused the unit department of being in a spying effort in its own backyard.
“Ten months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — I would call it — and they offered to give him a job in my herd in exchange for telling them what I was doing in my herds,” Moody said.
They clearly believe I'm a triathlete.
If that's the case, they should all return their briefs because they weren't capable enough to catch me.
Former RVL president Robert Roulston, new RVL president David Moodie and the current general manager of RVL knew it then and now they know it.
Does that make me think he's starting to be personal?
The RVL has a number of balls, and maybe it wants to make people outside of the operators responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I don't doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But when I get there, I don't care about anything, and that makes me sad.
It's really hurting me.
I'll put pressure on them, and I'll charge them with decision-making.
I have my family's support and I'll walk away.
The employee’s long-running cobalt investigation into Lidari and his disappointment over the subsequent sketching incident led him to call it “throw my license at the end of the table.”
The undefeated champion Moody described the race day care rule as "funny" by preparing Black Havyar, stating that the mud or clay shovel was against the rules of being thrown at the feet of the horse.
This is contrary to the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that.”
One of my men mistakenly pushed the mud on his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could've taken it yesterday, which is what happened.
He took the race day.
Moody may face up to three months of men's punishment for using the shovel in race day care as a result of the investigation that the managers have opened.
That's a joke.
Those who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We understand that we need rules, but this has gone a long way,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed in Cobram was arrested.
Police have arrested a man who was hit by a bicycle in Cobram over the weekend.
The bike was removed from the air on Saturday morning after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries to the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
Police said the driver of the crash escaped the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old biker, Cobram, continues to remain stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has responded strongly to his opponent's claims about the fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticisms of his team as an effort to "create a day" for NRL's two favorite priorities.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said Friday night in the semi-finals in Sydney that the referees allowed Storm to "fight" with his own team.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett described the match as a "virtual" match for the rugby league after the semi-final match he won against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night and said that it was "the power of two Oueensland".
Bellamy defended the team's fight and said they were only focused on the "team" while fighting.
Bellamy said it meant that they were worried Storm would beat them, so he took power from the criticisms coming to the two leading hockey teams.
This is progressing — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about the race when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
Throughout the year, I guarantee we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques, we’ve only made a real emphasis on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and that’s been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team he’s been teaching and he’s probably not used to losing a little shock to himself.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding Bennett of his teacher who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons championship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
"With their own matches on Saturday night, our Friday night match was a matter of comparison and how exciting their match was," Bellamy said.
I remember being criticized because St George was a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't give a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that we can call exciting football, and especially young halves with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He put that point in 2010, and now everyone wants to play football in this way – there are no half (both) of each team like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can’t play that way.
This gives me more confidence because they're even talking like that because they're a little scared to play.
When they went to the big games six weeks ago, they probably didn't bring us to their minds.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match 20 - 18, in our match both sides score more but is this exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut off the attacks but not make the scoring attacks?
To me, that's my agenda.
If they're talking about us, that means we're going to meet them here at a later stage.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or one of the Cronulla Sharks tickets went on sale on Tuesday as there is no weekend this Saturday night as they won the right to weigh in at AAMI Park on Saturday night.
Serbian man released with $200,000 bail for drug crime <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The man, who was caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine that had been smuggled to Queensland and faced a possible suspended prison sentence, was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people arrested last month by federal police last month, who came from South America via Vanuatu and was taken from Solay's 100 kg drug bed, which was dropped at the port in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen at a meeting in the marina with his accomplices during the morning and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of facing a potential fine for possession of a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all the drugs and could be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
High Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of an escape.
They have open links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied about where the police stayed in the public case.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to be released on bail.
Judge Flanagan said: “It is clear that the $200,000 bail fee after both parties read their affidavits is actually a financial burden on them.”
However, he warned that it was not enough alone to prevent him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for handing over both Australian and Serbian passports, both daily going to the karakol and keeping the ban on going to the streets between 6am and 6pm.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girls' Phone to Attract Pedophiles to Send Image
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request child abuse visuals.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, providing a series of inappropriate child views sent to her by another user by opening a session in an online messaging service.
The girl later woke up and realized she had no phone and found Hogg sleeping in her hands.
She looked at him and noticed the disturbing messages just before she alerted her mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address, and discovered “related” web searches made using terms for finding inappropriate children’s pictures.
Hogg later claimed that the reason for doing so was because he was "managing and managing pedophiles on the Internet" to "behave like the police."
Financial Representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "It's an addiction - it's an addiction that scares people.
He admitted the calls were made by the computer but said he did so to act as a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
Questions were asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him pictures of himself asking him to send more pictures of them.
He said he did it to attract them.
When he drank, he said he had sick ideas and wanted to watch images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When she found the girl’s messages on her phone, she screamed at her mother, and she was shaking and crying.
Mom saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and came after the accusations.
She met the girl and said she used the computer and Playstation to look younger than the defendant was.
Ward Road, 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate child pictures on June 14 last year, violating parole on January 25 this year and not attending court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim said Hogg could not be included in the category of sexual crimes because there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October, when the report of his past social work will be given.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but was held in custody for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were registered prior to the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe Speaks Wrongly in Zimbabwe’s Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the stairs as he climbed a podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The parliament's opening was marked by opposition MPs' claims that they had received anonymous death threats in the event that Mr. Mugabe spoke.
Last month, in the national speech he delivered in parliament, he was insulted and constantly interrupted - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
The Democratic Change Movement (MDC) leader, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received a message on their mobile phones so they wouldn’t bother them during Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“After Mr. Mugabe’s speech is over, it comes from an invisible number for journalists, but the title is ‘death’,” he said.
He tells members that their immunity is valid in parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokesman said the party was "concerned" by threats to its politicians, led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will put an end to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in terms of restructuring and cost reduction efforts in corporate services.
HP will split into two companies that will be listed as early as this year; the company will separate its computer and printer business from its faster-growing hardware and service operations.
HP said in a statement that the expected withdrawals would result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO of the post-departure unit, said: “These refurbishment activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company.
“Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio that will help companies transition to a new business style,” he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Company’s annual revenue will be more than $50 billion and will focus on offering “unrivalled integrated technology solutions” for companies.
The company, called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley", split into two garages at Palo Alto and was founded in the 1930s to make electrical equipment by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s largest PC maker and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that strict-focused companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere has problems with his teammates getting injured before the match, Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, there was no reason not to play at Christmas.
The best scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least four matches in England, and it is unclear if he will appear to be participating in the European Championship next summer when he looks back on his past.
The most embarrassing part of the final problem is that Wilshere had finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then looked for his old sharpness before the season.
“This type of injury career is not threatening,” Wenger said.
It's an unhealed bone.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with their wrists or previous injuries.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but there is also the danger of a player returning mid-season as Wenger would accept.
At the same time, there is an uneasy pattern.
According to research conducted by Pr<0xC3><0xB6>miyer Injuries Ltd, there have been 23 different discomforts recorded by Wilshere since its inception six years ago.
In the last five seasons, Arsenal have played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two First League teams that have lost most of the time in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 due to injury.
Wenger admits the potential of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes it will be time to recover from last season's injury record.
“Sometimes you have an open period of injury while you’re back from an injury, it’s a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope it stabilizes the body, I trust it, and I believe it will do the career it deserves.
The Champions League champions have Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur games to play on Saturday in front of Arsenal, which will start against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, and next Wednesday, the Wenger team prepares for them.
Hector Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, which makes sense that he would play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger may also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott with Nacho Monreal.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give players the breath they need,” Wenger said.
Despite Arsenal being one of the clear favourites of the F Group, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most coveted stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo did not lose 41 games last season after producing his own "Nama<0xC4><0x9F>lu" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on Tuesday night, according to Richter's scale.
This is the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal last season received the necessary lessons from the defeat against Monaco in the Champions League, and continues to be motivated by the far-reaching goal to bring the club's first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger says.
That's never happened in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I have enough experience to be realistic.
We are passionate but not imaginative.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that teaches us serious lessons about friendship between men
The lack of similar portals in programs is noteworthy; especially at a time when men need more to open up, and suicide rates among young men are at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45; and it was three times more common in men than women.
To address these problems, the Campaign Against Secular Living (CALM) announced 2015 as the Men’s Year and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
There is friendship at the center of the struggle to accomplish this difficult task.
A study conducted among high school students with more than 2,000 depressive symptoms showed that if a person has a high number of “healthy” friends who suffer from this disorder, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for non-depressive people, it halves the mental difficulties that a circle of mentally healthy friends may face.
But, of course, friendship needs to be accessible before it works.
In this age where social media is heavy communication, it makes it more priority to respond urgently rather than meaningful communication with a focus on style rather than content.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people, even if it’s really all about isolation.
The concepts of artificial success, which psychologists call external guiding values; money, image, under the domination of social status; in pursuit of these, the inner values that have a deeper impact on our mental health – our inner longing for personal development and friendship – are being wasted.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was to turn this focal point upside down.
Characters were not defined by their work but by their personalities, and they were manifested by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the minutes they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s relationship with Rachel all came to the realization that they could actually relate to them, even if they were in the background to fully explain the men’s feelings.
A co-worker told me: “...I saw how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference while listening to people who are depressed and suicidal.”
They don't talk to most of the guys who come in contact with us.
“A feeling like ‘passing and going’ is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness.”
One of the programs that came to my mind when recommending long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He emphasized the small moments of his friendship.
According to my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people in times of difficulty, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are redesigned for celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don’t know how your friendship will make a difference.
Friends, Comedy Central ends from scratch - all 236 episodes - #FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easy for PSG to beat Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after the goal he threw at Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the Swedish team to beat PSG, the goal they had scored in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the start of the Champions League on Tuesday.
Here are the match reports and match reactions.
In the match where Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani scored, Paris Saint-Germain started with a 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in the Champions League on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria was a PSG player who allowed the French champion to continue his way into the Champions League without completing the goal in four minutes, but in the 61st minute they were unable to assess the chances until Cavani scored the second goal.
In Group A, he needed to make a strong start against the Swedish champions of Paris, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to ensure a recovery in the quarter-finals of the last three championships.
But the game they were playing for was not the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of position around the penalty area and was later sidelined against the team of his hometown where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win either inside or outside the Champions League, but winning 2-0 in this regard will cause problems for our competitors and it's a good start to give a comfortable look, even if there are some things we need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though we didn't score more than one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with one of the three changes in the 2–2 match played with Bordeaux in the 1st League over the weekend, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When the Argentine winger was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a player who would bring PSG to a higher level in Europe, and Marco Veratti’s cross-country team ran back to Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and thought he was going to send Johan Wiland to the far corner with a nice shot.
However, everyone was disappointed when they waited for PSG to win a big victory.
To pass this tour, the playoffs were lined up with nine international players from Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, a five-man defender and two players in the midfield depth, a heavy contender.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic made very few attacks except for the one that struck the corner where Kevin Trapp was protecting.
On the other hand, PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient finals, Ibrahimovic was unable to make the final move in the first half at least five touchdowns, and when the second half started he caused disappointment by not following Cavani's game.
However, he showed that when he came to organize his business friends he was more master, Ibrahimovich, who in the 52nd minute sent Di Maria to the castle of Wiland, gave the spoils of the false blow.
After the second goal came in full time thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal of the season, with Maxwell appearing from the left wing after <0xC4><0xB0>brahimovi<0xC4><0x87>'s batting.
The idea that Malm<0xC3><0xB6> would return to the game was exhausted, and after the gold that Ezekiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, was not considered to have thrown in the previous order, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's score in the empty position and did not allow the score to change.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was superior to their own team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not at the same level as him.
Teams in the squad are not enough.
He's wearing a hat in Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore hit seven of its falling commodity prices and raised $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday as part of a split plan.
Listed in London, Glencore has announced that it has sold a new stake worth 1.6 billion Sterling to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was seriously affected by the falling commodity prices due to China’s economic slowdown on demand and confusion in the markets.
The issue of equity caused Glencore's stock prices to rise early on Wednesday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
Stocks opened 0.69 percent higher in the FTSE 100 index, up 2.77 percent by 131.60 pennies.
Glencore last week announced its $2.5 billion share sale plan last week, which is part of its plans to reduce debt collection by as much as a third.
The company sold 125 pennies per share of its new shares, which was down 2.4 percent from Tuesday’s close.
The group sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent.
Concerns about China’s long-standing growth have cut iron jewelry prices by roughly half; coal, copper, and other goods have fallen between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be visiting the United States at the end of the month.
Xi's first official visit to Washington was said to be on Sept. 25 and a return-to-visit to Barack Obama who arrived in Beijing last November.
After the two presidents' bilateral talks, U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will give Xi a dinner in honor of his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also noted that "President Xi's visit will allow the two countries' relations, as well as the US-China cooperation on regional and global issues, and will allow President Obama and President Obama to deal constructively with the issues of disagreement between President Xi."
Xi's visit to Seattle, first announced in February, is expected to meet with some U.S. technology leaders and then move to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address, among other things, Washington’s concerns about allegations of China’s cyber espionage activities and some of China’s controversial issues of claims of dominance in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Shows Variety in Filmmaking Is Irrelevant
Matt Damon objected to Effie Brown, an African-American film producer, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate on diversity.
In the Project Greenlight Sunday night episode, which aired on HBO, Brown cut off an experienced actor’s speech while emphasizing that alternative views on the black main character in the chosen scenario of the project should be emphasized.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you're doing it in the movie's cast, not in the show's cast.
Shockingly, Brown continued to comment on the actor's Mars film, reacting with statements such as, "Hey, wow, okay," that he was against it.
Co-producers to discuss the finalists of the Damon and Brown show were brought together by the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly.
Brown first said, “I wanted to think about how people—managers, whoever they are—will be treated to the character of Harmony.”
The only black character is a whore who was shot by a white conversation wire.
Dear White People’s publisher, the finalists insisted on the rights to direct the film, Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio. Damon responded that their assignments “can result in the way we don’t want them to.”
After the debate was published, there was an explosion of dissatisfaction with Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing that "Matt Damon is the only black person in the room who can explain his diversity to this person as it hurts NOTHING."
After tweeting, he got 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments came at a time when the right expression of racism in the media was at the forefront of social debates.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement effectively encouraged law-makers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color across the country.
In February, the singer Prince talked about the movement in a top-down fashion while announcing the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
Albums are still important, he said.
Albums like books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to the question whether or not the group should be considered a hate group by Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure in Fox News.
“Leaders say Black Lives Matter is a network of love,” he said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon had been included in the list of artists, producers and media patrons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned its first champion
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win a $1 million prize for winning the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
This competition, entering season 7, had never seen a competitor who could complete all the stages in the obstacle park before.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay on the final tour.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to complete this park, and thus became the first athlete to complete the difficult 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero managed to complete this park three seconds before him.
After this difficult victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News with the shock of having won a grand prize of $1 million.
Isaac told E! about his salary, "I think it's great to think about it, I've never earned or passed more than $10,000 a year."
I mean, it happened for a while, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like, the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also met The Hollywood Reporter in the final, and although he was the first contestant to finish the race, Britten explained why no awards would be given.
According to the rules, the money is given at the fastest.
Weed said, “If there’s more than one finisher, the fastest one will win the prize.”
Although money is a great reward and life changes, it has also won a great reward.
I don't think he has a bad idea about it.
He's so glad he did what he did.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
A hero according to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone beats me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think if his roles had changed, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja Warrior renewed the contract for the eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers beat Minnesota Twins to death
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn't too enjoyable for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best in baseball, the Tigers are now in the final stages of the American Central League.
Lowering his game to ruin, the Tigers managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field by scoring a perfect game on Tuesday.
The Twins lost their chance to rise to the U.S. Second League wild card by surpassing the half-point difference between the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, the situation was a return to a good game that wasn’t seen for much of the second half of the season.
The Tigers manager, Brad Ausmus, said: “It’s all about winning, no matter what.”
The Tigers' top scorer Alfredo Simon managed to score in the sixth and ninth innings by showing early attack support with Detroit's number three times in the first two strokes.
Simon (13-9) made 6 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were runs.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
“I just want to close the year strong,” Simon said.
It’s hard to waste every game for backups, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' chosen batsman, scored three runs and two runs, making it the first RBI he has won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-match night since his four-match win against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He threw the stick tight," said Ausmus.
It looked good (in wrestling training), it was already better to be seen in BP in a way that this situation continued in the game as well.
At the end of the seventh batting series, Twins had the best chance of re-entering the game, which caught three runs right.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the strike sequence by pairing the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to take a slow hit, and Simon caught up to hit him before he pulled the second goalkeeper BrianDozier to the left for BlaineHardy.
Mauer moved forward with the courage of the only player who could stand against right winger Drew VerHagen, who passed the batsman Miguel Sano on the run.
With a pair of runners in the second tie, VerHagen managed to draw third quarterback Trevor Plouffe into the doubles game.
Plouffe's hit against DP this season was the 27th time in the big league.
After trying to secure the Detroit Ninth, Mauer crossed the RBI and broke into the Tigers and drew close to Bruce Rondon by 5-4.
However, he was caught by Sano in three rounds for the right fifty-fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early exit of Phil Hughes, who lost his form.
The Tigers have won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-hander, who has been away from the field for more than a month due to back burn.
"That's not the game I want to play frankly," Hughes said, "but in the continuation I felt more comfortable and managed to make pretty good throws in the third shot."
When the first shot was successful, Hushes took the second goalkeeper Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right fielder J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the game, twice out of the game.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to pass the 0-21 band in the number-making position.
Third quarterback Nick Castellanos watched with one shot to the right, won another run but was shot while Victor Martinez wanted to make the third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers made the second addition, scoring 3-0 from catcher James McCann, an outsider and midfielder Anthony Gose, winning a two-outer.
Paul Molitor, the manager of the Twins, said: “It was a big blow.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes fired three shots that did not bring the number until he was replaced by the right-hand fifty savior A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs in six strokes and four unsuccessful strokes.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of play due to pain in his shoulder he used to throw.
In 2007, he will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery.
Sanchez, who has been on the injury list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, was scheduled to begin work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, he will start with LHP Daniel Norris DL against the Twins.
The Tigers are 1-1 in four games against Norris since they faced David Price on July 30 for the transfer.
He hasn't played since August 20 due to pain on the right side.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will fight Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world more
On Tuesday, a group tasked with managing reforms said President Xi Jinping needed to open the economy out more to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Group Meeting at the Centre to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, "China must develop its policies of opening up foreign investment by drawing expertise."
Xi said that making new reforms while encouraging the opening would create a new space for economic growth by bringing new energy and vitality.
The leader group adopted a number of proposals, such as a negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the inclusion of state-owned organizations (SOEs) into private capital, and reviewing the registration system of the settlements.
According to the explanation, a negative list will be drawn up that defines the prohibited sectors and business sectors for investment.
The system will be phase-tested and developed with trial programs.
This is an important move because it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also relax its control over the companies by allowing the companies to carry out their own business.
The statement also said that it would examine new cross-border models of economic cooperation in China's border regions and introduce new mechanisms to encourage regional growth.
More private space will be opened to open up government-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy, and will provide them with better services by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or "green card" will be optimized and facilitated by bridging the application process in one way.
The guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice and the upbringing of professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
According to a statement released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bag is now very fashionable-Times Newspaper's Friday Eki
In the fashion world, roads turn around and come in bags.
The currents that have been emerging recently are miniaturized...
It can also be said that small bags attached to the big ones attract attention.
They say that everything is small is beautiful.
I think this is also true for bags.
The wind began to blow in the opposite direction when the bags and bags were almost unable to move, and the bags tended to shrink.
There were already small bags, but this time they came up with smaller cases of large handbags.
Only your phone, credit card and key can fit into these tiny bags.
The flow that began with Céline and Herm<0xC3><0xA8>s spread with Prada.
The fact that the bag has become a miniature curiosity has also affected the newly released models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he made this season with two-dimensional cases.
Panda, polar bear, and elephant-shaped bags are the most elephant-like.
The mini sizes of large bags that luxury brands offer with phenomenal names seem to have once again attracted the most red carpet celebrities.
Hermes's "Birkin" bag, which Jane Birkin deliberately prepared, is one of the most preferred.
Jane Birkin, though, said in a press release that she didn't want her name to be remembered with a bag, but that's how it's in her memories.
Fashion weeks, however, allowed the mini bag flow to become more widespread.
Mini bags are also featured on the podiums.
It is not possible to put them in your arms because they are very small.
They can be used with their long suspensions in cross-sections.
But in the pods, we saw more of those long suspensions as wrapped in models' wrists.
Fendi is one of those who brings the topic of mini bags to an advanced point.
There's a suggestion for those who can't fit in a mini bag but can't give up on them.
Big bags of friends mini bags.
How's it going?
Mini bags turn into a bag that can be attached to their big ones.
This presentation, which stands out in the podiums, has quickly found its reward on the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Skin changes in the denim
Turkey will compete with world brands on the subject of sea.
The experience he has gained in production is now enriched by design.
The loft is one of them.
We see that black models, which used to be a few, are now starting to take their place on shelves every season.
In the season when blacks soared, scientists found their closest friend.
Leather parts and leather-detailed designs stand out as the best friend of denim.
In general, short-sleeve models called "motorbikes" are on my agenda.
While the strong air of the skin fills up the black parts again; the chiffon long blouses, ruby sweats give a sporty stylish look.
In the past, young people used to want to dress like a sailor and disappear into the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Now the young people want to carry a piece that emphasizes elegance as much as it is comfortable.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands the target audience with collections and complementary pieces.
Small step for Banksy, big step for “global”
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The artist's first exhibition of the Global Karak<0xC3><0xB6>y building, which is the product of his 15-year work and the first time the 85 original works have come together.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened in Global Karak<0xC3><0xB6>y (R<0xC4><0xB1>ht<0xC4><0xB1>m Street) the day before.
Of course, the world-famous artist who used his identity and the name Mustear, was not in the open.
We don't know if he's coming to Istanbul.
But according to the curator Steve Lazaridas, Bansky is not even aware of the exhibition.
There's no situation that would require her permission.
Because Bansky and Lazaridas, a former friend, broke up after 12 years.
Some of the works exhibited were collected by Lazaridas and some by collectors.
But there are some things that Bansky's followers are curious about.
What did Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", where 85 works were brought together?
For example, how would they meet the entrance to the exhibition with a ticket (35 TL)? What if they saw a small shop at the end of the 800 square meter gallery area?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, the Rose make sound that her works are printed on cloth bags, wallets, and necklaces that draw attention to the world’s most vulnerable subjects like Now?
It's a disappointment for Banksy's followers that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit has been turned into such a consumable.
It's not Banksy's style.
But you still get it without wasting a limited number of tickets!
For Banksy, the big exhibition for the small, globalized world can be seen until April.
These are the low and the unjust.
Let them go dig ditches.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued his reaction to the academics who signed the statement.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an said: "These are the wrong-doers, they are the lowliest."
Those who are with the wrong-doers are the wrong-doers.
He said: "They have committed the same crime because they are with those who commit the murder."
Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who left the carnage in place of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is a place of peace that smells of history and civilization, 10 of our German friends have been killed in such a region by the Germans.
I would like to convey my condolences to the entire German people, first of all, to the families of those who have died.”
“Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination,” he said.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, in response to the academics who signed the report, said: “I strongly condemn academics who stand up to all these terrorist incidents and issue a cover-up statement and sign those killings.”
It's not clear who our nation is that it's much closer to understanding who it is, that it's the professor who's docile in front of it.
They are people of cover.
These are the wrong-doers, they are the low-minded.
They have committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the murder.
Here's what happened in <0xC3><0x87><0xC4><0xB1>nar, where are those kids, the three-year-old Mevl<0xC3><0xBC>de, who was martyred with his father?
How do they incite their conscience to join in with his killers?
I invite all judicial authorities, the senates of universities to serve because of these actions contrary to our laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, let them do it there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, they can either go to the trenches or go up the mountain.
I speak so clearly and so clearly.
The results of TEOG have been announced

The academics who were being investigated for their signatures began to be arrested and removed from duty.
At the Faculty of Communication of Gazi University, some teaching members hung papers on the door of the room "We do not want in our university that supports the PKK".

'I found 26 people looking for two combatant boys'
Mete G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan's second documentary "Young Pilgrims", 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February) became the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section.
G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan, who is originally from Edirne but based in the Netherlands, explained why and how he drew the documents he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pilgrims", which tells the story of a six-legged school student who is aiming to become a world champion in combat, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pilgrims, the first documentary of Turkish construction to be selected for this section, is one of the candidates for the Crystal Moon Award.
Birth growth is Dutch, although originally Edirne was directed by Mete G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan.
When he was a child, he listened to his grandfather’s oily fighting stories in Turkey during his summer holidays and watched the fights.
“There are no political problems in Turkey.”
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, unfortunately, the fight against our horse sports is not very well known," he wants to come together with six directors to prepare a documentary project.
This project remains fruitless, but one day the news of the magazine he was reading on the plane opens the door to another project.
We stayed at the sugar factory.
The 10- to 11-year-old wrestler follows the story of his two younger brothers, Mete G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan, who goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The children's father won't let him take a photo for a documentary.
G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan explains how he overcame this challenge: “I thought about what I could do all day long.
The support could have been withdrawn from the Ministry of Culture.”
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya, where the kids are going.
I'm thinking about going there.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
We started shooting in a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory's dormitory."
It was the most difficult language for the director of the document, who completed the shoots in three weeks.
G<0xC3><0xBC>mrhan, who says that three different languages are spoken in the set where the foreign image director and voice work, "I didn't know what I was going to encounter when I pulled."
"They didn't know Turkish," he said.
The Young Pilgrims focus on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Raised by his grandfather and suffering from weight problems, Baran, Aaron, who is unable to attend trainings for breaking his arm, is a passionate but health problem, Bethtullah, the school’s beloved child, Hope, the youngest champion Ahmet and the group, Mohammed, who keeps together.
Mete G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan explains that he works with children: "I left them completely natural."
I was just trying to use Muhammad everywhere.
I did the first one and a half weeks of training.
My wish was for the kids to act like they don't have a camera.
"Luckily they got used to it quickly."
It was a surprise to be elected to Berlin.
Mete G<0xC3><0xBC>m<0xC3><0xBC>rhan, who said that the young people did not expect to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, said: "We had the preparations, but it was a surprise to be elected to Berlin."
The Young Pilgrims are not a sports document, but a production that recounts the struggles of children and conveys cuts from their lives.
“I wanted to bring the stories of children with family problems to the fore with the effort to identify and deal with their problems,” she says.
Supporting academics from the art world
Following the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative", the storm that broke yesterday's investigation into and arresting academics, on the one hand, comes statements of support.
The first support came from the writers, among whom there were many famous names.
The next day, the filmmakers announced their support for the theater.
In a statement signed by 138 theaters, "...we stand by this glorious meeting of the Academicians, who are called for peace as artists working in the field of theatre and performing arts, in which freedom of expression, equality, the right to life, and freedom of expression are held."
"With our conscience and with all our heart, we are voting for the academics' call for negotiation and peace."
Among them are Atilla <0xC3><0x96>zdemiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Nadir Sar<0xC4><0xB1>bacak, <0xC3><0x96>zcan Alper, Serra Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, Honor Famous, Ye<0xC5><0x9F>im Ustao<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Kara<0xC3><0xA7>elik, and more than 400 filmmakers.
But without it, but without it: "We will not be partners in this crime!"
We are with the Institute of Academics for Peace, and we are with the academics."
The Association of Cinema Writers (S<0xC4><0xB0>YAD) also made a statement, saying "We are with academics who have been made the target of the L<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xA7> campaign".
The Initiative of Academics for Peace, which was held in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January, issued a call for peace and dialogue to the government, issued a statement entitled "We are not partners in this crime".
In addition to the 1128 academics at Metne 89, thinkers including Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, as well as academics and books from around the world were also signed.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu called on the institutions to "do their best", calling on academics to "support terrorism", describing the statement of academics.
After this call, some universities ended the work of academics, while the prosecution began a rigorous investigation.
A large number of academics were arrested yesterday.
Fans, please help!
H<0xC3><0xBC>rrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
While trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to some place, it is seen as psychological discomfort after the point where it begins to affect life as a whole.
'Celebrity worship syndrome', another 'syndrome of worship to fame', has already become an academic topic in the world, and we have a newly discussed topic.
It can be considered normal for ladies to run in the salons with famous photos.
But let’s not forget the ‘Hurrem Sultan’ year when all the young people in Ireland have red hair.
In the aesthetic operations of 2015, we left behind, it was already known that 'Beren's nose was hurting.
The situation on the men's front is no different.
For a while, he was dressed like Polat Alemdar.
Now, on the other hand, the wind is blowing.
Justin Bieber's copy is full of guys and we're rockin' around.
So much so that this unnecessary information we've mentioned has been read thousands of times on the internet: "First, when you go to barber, cut the sides of your hair, that is, the top of your ears and the surrounding area, to the top of your head."
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting process is complete, you should shape your hair with light water.
After the shaping process is complete, stabilize your hair with the help of spray.
"Justin needs to shape when it's moist to get hair."
All of this, which has already become an academic topic in the world, gives us the name of the newly-spoken ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’, another ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’.
Fans of celebrities look like we're drowning in love.
Artists are proud of the number of admirers, and how much it affects them.
Fortunately, the psychological situation is not as simple as that.
There is a debate over what young people will eat and drink, what they will listen to, what celebrities will wear.
Excessive adherence to the names offered as inaccessible is defined as a spiritual discomfort in taking on a role model.
Specialist psychologist S<0xC3><0xBC>meyye Demir admits that Turkey is left behind in studies in this field.
However, he does not overlook the fact that families are slowly becoming conscious: “One of the basic issues of psychology science is that a person is at peace with himself, that he is at peace with himself, that he is at peace with himself.”
First, filling the children's room with posters, dressing one's ass wouldn't be taken very seriously.
That's changing now.
She feels the need to interfere with her parent's situation.
“A commitment to one’s passion is a sign that something goes wrong in a young person’s life.”
Fans on the emotional speed train
Interest in celebrities is dangerous, as long as they don't overdo it.
Iron suggests not wanting to get married, jealous of his wife, paying attention to symptoms such as preferring his dressing gown.
We're talking about famous people by name.
Worrying about them, being related to their lives, is considered normal to some place.
But when the expert psychologist sneezes, the young people who miss the cantata ball are mostly: "When there are no names to represent the child in the family or in the environment, when there are no names to represent him at the point of nice behaviors."
There are not always good examples.
"He's copying the negatives, too, kid."
When we talk to them about how we approach them, S<0xC3><0xBC>meyye Demir begins by reminding them that celebrity passion syndrome is seen more in youth.
Considering that the elderly may be insecure, the problem is more comfortable.
On the one hand, while complaining about the limitations of their families, on the other hand, we face support and compassion waiting for young people: "We are forced to consider their emotional departures."
New research reveals that they’re struggling because of changes in the brain.
"The connection of a young man to an emotional speed train with a passion must also be met naturally, should be approached softly."
It is possible to change behaviors
Specialist psychologist S<0xC3><0xBC>meyye Iron recalls her duties to her parents to overcome the syndrome of worship to fame:
Recognize her emotional distress, make sure you are calm before you get into the matter.
Don't ever let him suppress your feelings.
Please note that you have respect for his admiration in order to promote independence.
Show a good example instead of teaching by chance, discuss the names that will be role models for her.
Try to take the place of celebrities in our daily lives together.
Reading books that tell the real world of celebrities will work together.
Be sure to transform your communication into an adult form of communication.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept it as it is.
Be sure to get expert support for your fan base.
And those who are angry, and those who are angry, are amazed.
The foundation of celebrity worship syndrome is someone else’s need for hope and help.
Unrequited love is actually a call for help.
But unfortunately, it's not perceived that way.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it is not possible to limit it to a country or a continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyao<0xC4><0x9F>lu notes that there are certain names that occupy television in every country.
The syndrome shows itself more by connecting with these celebrities: “They’re extraordinary.”
Most people don’t have their options.
Those who have it will not live like them.
Either because they don't accept it or because they don't dare.
“But those who do not have the opportunity, if they do not have the opportunity, continue to watch with anger that does not live like them.”
It doesn't matter who's coughing or sneezing.
Both of them have an inside look.
They make effortless money, they're on the magazine's agenda.
It’s enough to increase your fan base.
Another advice of expert psychologist S<0xC3><0xBC>meyye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this very point.
It should not be overlooked that religious life is concerned.
The support of the environment for those who are passionate about fame comes into play here.
However, he dares to admit that he is a fan of his fame as well as his own.

Should I have Safra Scalp Surgery? - Family - Health News - Time Gazette
Dr. Fevzi <0xC3><0x96>zg<0xC3><0xB6>n<0xC3><0xBC>l answers the questions in the corner of the Square Gazette.
I have a stone in my gallbladder and every morning when I get up, I go to the toilet 2 or more times a day with stomach pain after meals.
Is that going to stop me from losing weight?
I'm starting to use alkaloids right now, but my appetite doesn't decrease, I don't lose any weight.
That's what I've been doing since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have a gallbladder surgery?
CEVAP: Sapphire is often accompanied by an infection.
Complaints of this stomach ache that develops immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, the gallbladder swells and releases the inflamed gallbladder into the intestines.
The guts, which are uncomfortable due to inflamed gallbladder, quickly try to throw this gallbladder out.
That’s why you often go to the bathroom.
Because you often go to the toilet, what you eat is also thrown away from digestion, and it’s slow to lose weight.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a Gastroenterologist and the condition is determined using antibiotics, you can get rid of it.
But at the end of the day, you may also need a gallbladder surgery.
These probiotics may reduce your complaints a little, but they won’t go away.
Whatever it is, keep on using the probiotics.
Because the biggest helper for your weight loss is this probiotic powder.
I eat a lot of food when I’m stressed.
When my teacher is stressed and angry, I feed myself and gain weight.
How can I deal with this?
CEVAP: Excessive desire for food actually means that the need for energy is not fully met.
The reason for this may be to have little to eat or skip your morning and afternoon meals.
Another reason is that you can’t digest the foods you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you don’t have a problem with ulcers, reflux or similar, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic.
You will see its benefits too much.
I can't lose weight, doctors don't know why.
In your corner, there is usually information about weakness.
It makes a lot of sense to me, too, but my situation is a little different.
I can't lose any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
Doctors say nothing.
CEVAP: The techniques we apply are not just about weakening, but about restoring the physiological functioning of the body to its ideal dimensions.
Weakness and obesity are the same kind of discomfort.
Without losing weight in weight, losing weight in weight is treated with the same technique.
You will also be weaker when you eat sweet and savory foods.
I think you've figured it out so far.
You can also be alerted with carboxypunkur and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you're getting away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have also moved away from their ideal bodies by fattening them.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, they will also reach by gaining weight.
If the system problem gets rid of you, you gain weight, they also lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels worthless gets caught in ‘hate’
There are some emotions that are born in the world of feeling.
Fear, sadness, happiness, astonishment, anger, anxiety...
However, feelings like hatred, anger, revenge occur in children over time and as a result of some misbehavior.
Every person needs to be an individual, including the period of childhood.
So whether you respect your parent’s or social environment decisions, ask for an idea on issues that interest you, and you want to feel that it is valuable.
The provision of these forms the basis for the formation of a healthy person.
For example, in matters that concern the child, the decision to take the place of the child (what to wear, what to eat), the behavior of the child is not concerned with the wishes of the child, and the behavior of the child is not directed to his own truths (to be sent to the instrumental course of the child who wants to go to the football course).
The defense mechanism, because a child who is not respected for self and being, loses his freedom to “be himself,” reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
“Because it’s actually the exact opposite of accepting anger and hate,” says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who tries to tell both himself and the environment that the child doesn’t accept what he does by hating him.
The expert psychologist, who points out that not accepting the child's condition and reacting in this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, means "hate here 'I am' too" serves the purpose of protecting the child's self-respect."
“If the child is allowed to be an individual, the hatred will disappear,” he says.
The child tries to protect himself by harboring anger and hatred.
At a young age, both physically and mentally the most vulnerable times, Arslan, who says that the parents of children exposed by their surroundings to verbal and emotional violence can cause negative emotions in the child, is unaware that the presence of the child is not noticed, is invisible.
Arslan goes on to say: "It can sometimes be not only in the emotional sense that their needs are not being met (not brushing their hair, hugging and kissing, school or other needs), but also in the physical needs (eating, drinking, hosting, schooling).
This is an attitude of cultivation that opens the door to hatred.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are behaviors such as humiliation, insult, contempt, humiliation, unnecessary and severe punishments, feelings of worthlessness, shouting.
Because these behaviors are directed at the child's personality, they touch a deep place.

Romania Goes to Transparency in Election Spending
A new bill is being drafted to fully determine the source of the money used in Romania and bring a high limit to spending.
The government wants to make more transparent the money assistance provided by the person and companies sponsoring the elections.
The 'decision money' used in the elections is also expected to be preceded by the draft law.
Each party or person in the draft must spend their money on election propaganda through a bank account.
All the money spent in this way will be more transparent and regularly controlled by the Romanian Election Commission (AEP).
It is also planned to put a high limit on expenditures in the draft.

Attacks on journalists have become commonplace in Turkey.
Ahead of Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a Turkish letter with a joint signature to British Prime Minister Cameron.
PEN members asked Cameron to bring up the backlog of press and freedom of expression in Turkey in his meeting with Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Britain’s leading writers sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, urging his predecessor Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to bring up to date the backlash on freedom of expression in Turkey during his visit to London next week, which will be held by his colleague Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
The International Union of Writers (PEN) has also raised serious concerns about the "unspecified pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey" in the letter, which includes 25 authors, including the presidents in England, Wales and Scotland.
The authors point out that threats and physical attacks have become commonplace to journalists, writers and publishers; the attack on H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet Newspapers offices has reminded the Koza <0xC4><0xB0>pek Media Group as an example of oppression and handshake.
Among them were Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, and a member of the PEN, who was also a member of the PEN, including Elif Dawn, where three journalists were arrested for the Vice News institution, other journalists were charged, and arrests were made for journalists.
The authors note that the arrest of Can D<0xC3><0xBC>ndar and Erdem G<0xC3><0xBC>l in the investigation in the case of the MIT TIRs is also a cause for concern, "informing journalists in Turkey to carry out their real tasks in society".
He noted that attacks on journalists, writers and publishers have violated the freedoms of the entire Turkish society.
He said journalists and writers were exposed to surveillance methods that existed until the physical attacks due to a common "culture of inviolability."
The authors noted that the number of Turkish citizens who have been accused of insulting the president has increased, and after Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was elected in 2014, he has opened more cases of insult than the total number of his predecessors.
Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's words were spoken
It was noted that the six drawings show that Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who will be visiting London next week, was one of several government members who expressed support for press freedom, while those words did not turn into action.
The letter stated that "Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's visit to London is therefore an important opportunity for Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to make a clear commitment to freedom of expression in Turkey".
The authors asked Cameron, Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu, to make sure that the government respects Turkey's obligations regarding freedom of expression.
25 authors with signatures in the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (Chairman of the Scottish PEN), Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn (Chairman of the Geller PEN), Moris Farhi, Maureen Freely (Chairman of the British PEN), Richard Gwyn, Mark E.
