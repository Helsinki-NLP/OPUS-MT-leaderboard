The Welsh AM is concerned about 'looking muppets'
There is growing fear among some AMs in the proposal that their title should be replaced and made MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plan was to change the name of the assembly and make it Welsh Parliament.
A lot of people are afraid of the different colors of politics, which can lead to laughter.
Here's an AM from Labour, worried their group would "hear it Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not from Wales: In Welsh, twp and tae are twp.
An AM from Plaid said the group was "not happy" in general and they had already proposed what they could buy.
A Welsh Conservative, on the other hand, said his group was "open-minded" in changing the name, but he also said the MWP was not far from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English is similar.
According to the Assembly Commission, which currently proposes a law to change the name: "Any final decision on what to call Assembly Members to its own members depends."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received widespread support calling the Welsh Parliament the assembly.
Regarding what to call the AMs, the Commission favoured the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from the public consultation.
AMs are likely to be replaced, but the head of the President's Office, Elin Jones, could hurt everyone to agree, which is expected to issue a bill in just a few weeks.
The child in the reforms included other changes in the running of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
In AM the last vote on what should be called them when they have already debated the law.
Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of the country
There will be a vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will be carried out at the will of the resolution a few decades ago next to Greece, with its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor means that they own its territory and that Athens has repeatedly challenged its request to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is contesting the plebiscite in the name change, did not respect the vote.
However, these supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, simply in exchange for the name change their membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Tears are silent as the Harlem Churches are struggling
"Once upon a time," said the elder, "there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now, there's nothing."
He said he understands the loss of the bar.
"People's relationships are different at the moment," he said.
"People don't blame bars where people go all the time."
For the churches, he feared that soon as the leaders expected the money to be obtained from the sale of the property, "they too will soon return to where they started."
He added that the ruins of the apartment buildings can be replaced with condominiums filled with the kind of people who cannot help the remaining shrines of the community.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "so it will only speed up the arrival of the day when these churches are closed because those who live in said condominiums will be far from being part of these churches."
White congregations built the same church before the Blacks became the Harlem-Community Metropolitan metropolis in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation that worships near the building took its title.
The black congregation besieged St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of farmers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which countered the reception or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his replacement at St. Martin's, called the carillon "the eyes of the savages".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something different: "a cultural foundation" and "an irreplaceable and exciting instrument."
Adding to the famed Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
G. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in its final months was a complex story of architects and contractors, in which some were entered by the un ordained church leaders and others were entered by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocese wrote in July the vestry - the governor of the parish, which consists of unordered leaders - regarding the memorial "passing the expenses" of the diocese to the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the reception of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty to the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old man has been stabbed to death by a California lobster
A shark attacked and bitten the 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he descended for the lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, harvest officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Ani Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, had a half-hour dive on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a boy begging for a kiss and he approached it with his group to pull him out of the water.
Ani Hammel, he thought it was just a thrill to catch the lobster he heard, but "I realized the boy was screaming, 'I'm sick!
I got caught!"
"It's been a long time," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I'm going to throw all the fish in the water and say, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not clear what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Ani lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media meeting, there was an extinct shark in the area a few weeks ago but it was not identified as a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the sea from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for an investigation and for safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using department store-style beauty aisles with specialist assistants.
As an important part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as the fashion and lifestyle advantage falls, it will try out larger beauty islands in 11 stores across the country, and will increase next year if it succeeds.
Investment in beauty is on the rise as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill up shelf spaces that were previously used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Ani Sainsbury's, they double the size of their beauty sales to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also re-energize its Boutique makeup products to be vegan in favor of most of what it suggests - something that is being demanded by an increasing number of young consumers.
In addition, Sainsbury's will try to sell the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming part of the year.
Shopping online and shopping for a small amount of food every day at local convenience stores has led to supermarkets making more efforts to encourage people to visit.
Ani Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will more likely create department stores outlets as the supermarket chain fights off discounters such as Aldi and Lidl who have more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's puts Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered several Habitats since they bought the same chain two years ago, which they said helped increase grocery sales and led to an increase in the profits of the purchased companies.
The last attempt by the supermarket to change their beauty and pharmacy department was not successful.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stopped after there was an argument on how to distribute the proceeds from its chemist's stores to supermarkets.
The new strategy originated after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Unfortunately, Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding products from luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty islands to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in employees with special training and are willing to give advice.
Our brands have been designed to meet every need, and attractive surrounding and convenient locations mean we're people's top destination for improvement that challenges the exciting way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den's Peter Jones is furious after retiring TV presenter Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with her business lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for Truly, their brand of home appliances and accessories.
The business of the said pair is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old actor announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den's Peter Jones for abruptly withdrawing from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on her bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "angry angry" when the TV's golden girl admitted to a fierce meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of their huge business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he had no time for Truly, their brand of household appliances and accessories.
This business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million assets.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source of information: "Today, Truly is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that would cross him over the next few decades.
Everyone was very surprised by his departure from the scene.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, but it's too close.
There is a warehouse full of Marlow HQ products ready for sale."
Experts believe the company will lose millions of dollars in the removal of the performer of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most massive personalities, as a result of large investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household appliances, and in those that can be prone to delays.
And it can serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children are ten years closer to Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity by ITV.
A source close to Jones said: "We're not going to comment on his business issues."
"We're friends and then we're friends"
He joked about the criticisms he would receive from the news media over the comment that it could be "unpresidential" and because of being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
This is Trump's response to his "news anchor" speech.
"I didn't give anything up."
He claimed Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have been delayed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing "equal action" from the U.S. as they were making weapons reductions.
Instead, he stated, the U.S. continues to tighten its grip to keep the truce.
Trump had a more positive outlook on his speech at the rally.
"We have a very good situation in North Korea," he said.
"We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to release hostages, and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about their relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to stand up as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
Indonesia's Earthquake and Tsunami on the Island, Deadly Road
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, there is no declared national emergency, a precondition for prompting aid from abroad.
"On many occasions, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek help from other countries, so it is rather difficult," said Bb.
Although the Save the Children team is set up to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign personnel can work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster department, Indonesian officials are still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international staff will be allowed to participate in the assistance.
Despite the earthquake often experienced by Indonesia, they are still not ready for the storm of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other sea-coasts.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there is an existing warning, is also likely to have reduced lives.
At the best time, the trip between the Indonesian islands can be tried.
Natural disasters are becoming more and more critical of logistics.
An opsital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is currently heading to Palu, but will arrive at least three days before the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's luxury infrastructure the center of his election campaign, and he has already provided a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is suffering from a lack of funding due to his upcoming re-election next year.
G. Joko also faced persecution from the remaining sects in Indonesia, where most Muslims embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other offensive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool goes on to defend against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea when he scored in the 89th minute of the game on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xherdan Shaqiri beat Sturridge about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team struggled 1-0.
He wanted to get the ball off before being kicked to the far post of goal.
The ball flew over the top of the box and it flew over the top right corner of the net.
Later, the ball crashed into the net behind the batting Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It's just in the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq are always trying to play as far as possible, so I just tried to take all the time I could get," Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so I had already made a kick and I didn't think too much about it and I just followed the trail."
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker passes the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he goes to the midfield side and crosses to the Liverpool side in the field.
Kovacic quickly gave up in the midfield.
He settled in a swing through the ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard took over the defence and he lived with his left foot on the net with a far post just past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia was 832.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster department on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of the building collapsed due to a 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday that caused waves to reach 20 floors, crop Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokeswoman for the office, at a news conference.
Ruins of collapsed buildings spread to the City of Palu, with more than 380,000 people.
A man, 32, suspected of having been raped and murdered by a woman, arrested by police
An investigation into the stabbing was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stabbings at 7:55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have already urged anyone in the area to approach them with something seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "The investigation has just begun but I am calling on anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard of any suspicious contact with us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have gotten any footage on the dashcam to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
The Birkenhead police spokesman confirmed the woman was found and she was inside a property.
This afternoon, friends came to believe they knew the woman to ask where she found her this morning.
The investigation continued while police said they were reporting the incident to the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tries to enter his flat but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take a few hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A policeman has been heard telling a man that the whole scene is considered a local crime scene.
A woman was crying when she arrived at the scene.
He repeatedly said that it was "slow."
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon while another van was just outside.
There were several police officers standing inside the cordon and monitoring the block of flats.
Ask anyone with information to DM on <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers without introducing 0800 555 111 and mention log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Revolt of Parliament's latest watchdog targeted by the fight for 'history change'
The removal of it was justified by its indiscriminate destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described G. Crick's proposal as "fake" and "planning to change history."
Ani John Goldsmith, administrator of the Cromwell Society: "It is inevitable that the current debate on the removal of the revolts will target Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the destruction of sacred images during the civil wars in England.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas had done in the last century.
Prove Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent creation to Cromwell of 19th century opinion and part of the study of the history of a person believed by many still to be celebrated.
Ani G Goldsmith in The Sunday Telegraph: "A lot of people consider Cromwell, perhaps more than the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against the outsider, in his case of course, the monarchy.
The historical debate is still alive if it is accurate to describe it in general.
It is only certain that the mid-17th century custom shaped the subsequent formation of our country, and Cromwell was a unique figure who represented one aspect of that rapprochement.
It is also worth celebrating and remembering those who have overcome him as Lord Protector."
A pig that kills a Chinese farmer's
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only to his surname "Yuan," who was dead and had a cut artery, was found in a pig cage near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig keeper is preparing to put a vaccine on pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan municipality on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, she was found dead by her cousin, and she found an open door in the nearby pig cage.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth inside the cage.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the farmer had shed 550 pounds of pork, according to the report.
"Dung and twisted the legs of my cousin," his cousin, who was only known by his nickname "Wu," said in Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour ago.
Yuan or his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
Here is a market manager in the Evening News, who has been arrested for not attacking the pig, while police are gathering evidence in the area.
According to the report, there was a negotiation between Yuan's family and the market authorities for payment of his death.
Although rare, there have been cases where pigs have previously been recorded attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, which caused critical male injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig approached the Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife feared the animal would be removed.
After his pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive but could serve as a "pull" to them the taste of blood.
"They're just being playful.
They like to bite, to discover... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remaining strength will bring extensive and heavy rains to the southwestern U.S.
As it has been reported, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it heads into the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rain throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 Hurricane, had a speed of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a growing trough over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastward to the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will make the coming trough of extensive and heavy rainfall in the South-West over the coming days.
In the locality, it will cause dangerous sudden flooding, the flow of debris, and the destruction of desert land by 1 to 4 inches of rain.
Deep tropical moisture will cause recurrences of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapid worsening of conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It's not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
The canyons can be flowing rivers due to heavy rain, and storms with local heavy winds and dusting can be carried.
Local heavy rains will bring the approaching depression to some parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible for the brake to reach a total of more than half an inch, which can lead to a partial flow of debris and a slippery road.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during its rainy season.
Several widespread tropical rains will begin arriving in Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday night.
Heavy rains are expected in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, in October there will be rapid changes in temperature throughout the U.S., while the tropics will remain relatively warm.
At times, it causes severe changes in temperature at close distances.
There is a good example of a sharp difference in temperatures throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will be tested to increase and expand again.
There is expected to be a warm beginning of October with a broad 80s majority of the central and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the Northeast.
New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be higher than 10 degrees in practice.
Our long-term weather report says the high probability of higher than normal temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million people watched a restraining order on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation of the FBI's cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh found him drunk and tried to distract him from a high school party.
In a heated testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were reported by Nielsen on Friday following it.
The company counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that released it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a problem with the number of people looking at the offices.
To be more clear, this is equivalent to the number of spectators playing the football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's personality, has an estimated 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 1.3 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remains high after the hearing.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement that he voted in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning by CNN and CBS which protesters cheered as the elevator boarded to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood his eyes down as he was insulted for several minutes, and released it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power while many women have no power."
Before the elevator closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement, which in the hearing of the committee he would say more.
It's been broadcast live for hours after it's all cable and broadcast networks, while the Judiciary Committee should weigh in to advance Kavanaugh's nomination throughout the Senate to vote on it.
But Flake said he would only do so because his understanding would be that the FBI will investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats have already pushed.
Flake was somewhat convinced of their conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was clear that the Republican votes would not reach Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'policy' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politics" in Britain's future and undermining the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May came for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside May on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal Britain and the US should collect each other's tariffs was "like wisdom."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested, and jailed in the second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers of the fight between Sims and Simpson released a video and police said Sims had lost his mirror in the fight.
Police captured the mirror on the scene and said they saw Simpson's DNA here, reports WAFB, an affiliate of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to the shooting at Wayde.
His fine is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The Coroner's Office of the East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which, the cause of death was a gunshot to the head that broke through the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for helping with the investigation prompted by the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law students for their "effort and quest for justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
Baton Rouge grew 6-foot-6 forward, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "surprised" at Wayde's death.
"That's what you always remember," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Reaching homes south of Mexico's capital, the frog was spewed by the volcano Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to withdraw from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and to register 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of noise and hearing.
Images on social media show the thin ash surrounding car windshields in places in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 kilometers) away in the southeast of the capital after a 7.1 quake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been active called "Don Goyo" since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists in Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashing with pro-independence protesters protesting the riot police, and as thousands joined the opposition's action to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's brutal vote on the crackdown.
The egg and powder paint of a group of masked pro-separatists broke up the riot police that stopped them, and it made black clouds of dust on the streets usually filled with tourists.
The police also clashed over dinner and used rocks to control the fighting.
Many times pro-independence groups have called for "no forgetting, no forgiveness" to face the Unionists protesting shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local newspaper reported.
Tensions remain high in the region calling for independence after a year of a referendum on October 1 deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans as separatists.
The majority of voters were chosen to stand on their own even though few voted because the majority of opposition voters voted against the ballot.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the regional precincts in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to block action supporting the national police.
The action continued but was forced to go through another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer relies on the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year, we had one of our biggest moments.
"My parents were happy to see me, but we didn't want to leave," he said.
Despite having achieved a hectic victory in the regional election last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to fend for themselves this year because of being exiled or imprisoned and waiting to be heard by many of their famous leaders because of their role in organizing the referendum and organizing the referendum.
Ani Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest that supports the police, which politicians from both sides handle the ceremony.
"It's just a reminder," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the last part of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being an election candidate in Europe is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic principles and control that we have seen from the government of Spain," he said.
Londonderry: Three men arrested after car wrecked a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly smashed a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself were damaged.
It might as well have been at a crossbow point that was locked in the car.
Menga's tie, winning Livingston against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's victory
Livingston reported the Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second three of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tie was what was needed to keep Gary Holt's team in Hiberian in second.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in the Premiership this season and they will face the top Hearts who beat them by eight points, next week.
Prior to that, the Rangers would fight Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended their unbeaten division play in six games, with head coach Holt unbeaten since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has lost the opportunity to face off against visitors
Holt's team should have taken a long lead before they could score, if not because of their direct being that caused a problem for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed away, but tried to score, and Alan Lithgow's batting away because he was met by Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were happy to play the Rangers in front of them, because they knew they could make it difficult for the guests at the designated points.
That's how the important goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and got Livingston a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to take care of Menga, who got the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
At that point, Rangers had already picked up the ball but they struggled to get through the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled a little bit.
This game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force the save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow resided away from another set of Livingston plays.
Moving on to the Livingston side continues and is also continued to be pushed, as two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - are considered.
"Amazing" from Livingston - review
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Wonderful game and result for Livingston.
In a person, they are good, continuing to exceed expectations of higher growth.
Their playing style and character haven't changed much since they once again became the best, but Holt should be highly commended for his push to the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, leading the organized defense, as Menga struggled with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last ball was missing - only once they opened their side - and it seemed to be a call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the range.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a different reaction in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued about human rights issues, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
This city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have called for security to stop 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - have also called for Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
Two different protests mirror the compassionate visitors who are considered heroes of some German Turks and hailed as dictators of others.
On the Deptford road: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died after a car collided in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to find out the identity of the man and to inform his relatives.
There were road closures and variations of the way of the buses and cautioned motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the riot
Six prison officials were injured in the riot in the men's high security prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is currently ongoing.
Specialists were sent "Tornado" officers to deal with the riot, carrying eight prisoners and keeping them in a wing.
The scene was attended by officers for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "There have been specially-trained personnel who have been assigned to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not allow violence to be confined to our premises, and we make it clear that those responsible will be brought to the police and can be held for a longer period of time."
There are more than 500 prisoners at HMP Long Lartin, among the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the presiding officer was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the prison was called by riot officials to handle a serious riot in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Rosa Storm Threatens Sudden Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Survivors May Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare for Arizona, but that could happen in the early part of the next week due to the passage of the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa in the Desert Southwest, putting the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, has issued a follow-up.
The Rosa storm is expected to hit Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and it will be approaching Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten more tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rain, with an island-sized volume of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
The rest of the Desert Southwest area is likely to get 1 to 2 inches along with the central Rockies and the Great Basin, possibly with an eighty-seven total of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not in danger of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is drenched.
Although the flooding is serious, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the South-West is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced severe droughts, the second highest category," the weather.com report said.
The first of these was Hurricane Rosa to land on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Still with storm power and the fastest wind of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, the Rosa storm is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at a rate of 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with colder waters in the Pacific and was therefore weak.
So it is expected to land in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
Rain can be strong in some parts of Mexico, bringing with it a great risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected in Baja California to northwestern Sonora, potentially reaching 10 inches," the weather.com report said.
Then the Rosa storm will go to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border of early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk to Rosa or her lips is the very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to result in dangerous sudden flooding and debris flooding in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after finding a 16-year-old man with stabbings in Somerset.
The teenager was seen injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who has a photo of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh 'distressed' by the Democratic Party's 'crazy, angry', Trump says
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to avert the brutal and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "distressed" the Democratic Party's "seriousness, anger" in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh was ousted in Congress on Thursday, forcing and emotionally rejecting the charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she had denied it decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford has also been charged with the charges against him.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's origin and quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a lawyer with a mechanical history of public service," he said at a rally of supporters in West Virginia.
The President hailed Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the cost of Republicans voting in the midterm election.
"It's only been five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not going to run, but I'm going to run," he said.
"So wherever I am, good candidates are fighting."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was "to fight and stop."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be carried out by no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Death toll in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, as, expected to rise
About 384 people were killed, most of them stabbed to death by giant waves on the beach, when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi collapsed and collapsed, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves hit the beach reaching six metres (18 feet) at dusk, as most of them died and all its passageways were destroyed.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami rose yesterday, people on the beach were still carrying out activities and did not immediately leave and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"It didn't pass without the tsunami, it dragged cars, houses, it hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach.
Others climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people fled the 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops were damaged, bridges being torn down and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the city on the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have experienced a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by the large quake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could boost the strength of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of other victims were found trapped under collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and injuries could be higher along the beach 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "totally cut off without data" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency's criticism was widespread on Saturday as they did not hesitate to have a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said waves had arrived at the time warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building shouting fears of impending tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the beach, since the buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate efforts to save.
Military cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities had begun to send out, authorities said, but still needed food evacuees and other key needs.
The city's airport has only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll in Indonesia's Tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very famous.
As World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees stayed in tarpaulin shelters built in the yard of their shelter, they saw scenes of road damage, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even though aid groups have already started a tough start with the launch of disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, equipment, and personnel from other countries can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"This disaster is only at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government has said, 'O.K., it's a national disaster,' we will be open to the help of other countries but not yet."
By the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will inspire the devastating stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, there was a boy who was pulled from an incinerator.
On Sunday, the rescuers removed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games which ended in the first part of this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including G. Mandagi, were his students.
"As I get older in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
G. Gendon recalled that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the players of Palu, who participated in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a blue check mark, rather than a pair of blue check marks.
"I don't think the messages were sent," he said.
Thieves, charged $26,750 as ATM re-fills in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled the ATM's contents at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver's body drains an ATM into the entertainment complex and is preparing to transfer more money, writes Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, there was another man "running from behind Brink's character" and stealing a bag of money to be delivered.
Many of the culprits were found by witnesses fleeing the area, according to the release, but police did not specify the number of the culprits involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper will change his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name - to Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former recognized Kanye West."
Ye has long nicknamed West, 41, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande who has cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Apart from being the spreading of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said in the first part of this year's discussion of the title of his album on radio host Big Boy.
If so, I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means alone, to being only Ye - to be just a mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects more on who we are."
He was one of the first rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced a liking for the names Love and Brother Love.
Satisfied with having or without middle and big letters in the name were former collaborators with West JAY-Z.
Mexico's AMLO, promises not to use military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to control Mexican citizens."
Troops of soldiers set fire to a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people were killed at a time when the left-wing student movements throughout Latin America were raging.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican children by providing monthly aid to students and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of employment and lack of opportunities for education are threatening young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. needs to double its A.I. funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments were made after AI ads were made by various parts of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. lacked formal AI strategy as a whole.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: it aims to become No.1 in AI transformation by 2030.
"It's a good start to double the AI research budget, as the U.S. has left all other countries very much behind, and we're looking for the next success in AI," Lee said.
Double funding will double the chance in the U.S. to make the next major AI success, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who authored the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worried about an AI system that defeated the best American player of Otherllo, and then, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next contest would be held, to help identify future visionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. need to try to get help from the government, Lee said.
"China isn't getting the top academics; it's not the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other luminaires' technology companies have taken out universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy would help the U.S. boost its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to those with PhD in AI," he said.
China's State Council published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other governing organizations provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the early part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In terms of NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has not yet seen action seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for several months.
Macedonia, vote on whether to change the country's name in a referendum
Macedonia's citizens voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, an action that could fix the decades-long dispute between them by Greece that has blocked its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has insisted on claiming its territory the name of its neighbouring country in the north and has refused Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but it was argued by nationalists that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he was not weighted in the referendum and raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to take effect.
This is the stated question in the ballot in the referendum: "Would you like to be a member of NATO and the EU along with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth seeking entry into groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by the law, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to consolidate it.
The name change requires two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko, voted for a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name that will pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and sat in front of the stalls arranged by the boycotters in the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join very high and not enter the door of the wings," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a tough country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the US and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that it would be "proof of our future" the "yes" result.
A vote published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were involved in the referendum - down to the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were overweight yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and then one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the Kanlurang government's policy since it replaced it in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat Brighton's full defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling predicted Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game easy on his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
He skipped between the three defenders of Brighton, before hitting the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green clothes.
He forced a defender ahead of the run a few more at the end of the Brighton box.
He then jumps to his left and finds Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a tie on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," City governor Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage over the pitch in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball while deep within Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a good through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net before starting out on the border.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, who wants to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff contention, there was no reason to push another start.
But Scherzer is always hoping to get the mound position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but that is if the Rockies still have implications for the playoffs with a playoff lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At any rate, the Rockies secured a wild-card position with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for the left, we can stick to the mound, at any rate, knowing that feeling here in Denver, along with the citizenry and the other team, is possibly the highest level of any point I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they are hoping that Scherzer will be allowed to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and pitch on the usual day of his Sunday break.
Washington right-handed was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
The President did not explicitly specify the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the significance of Republicans' outcome in the midterm elections.
"We've done everything we can in November.
It's only been five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm afraid to fight good candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this appallingly radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to take power away by any means necessary, you see the virtue, the error.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should beat to get the power and control, power and control they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to counter and block."
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and ugly and disgusting and lying."
He cited the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received strong vocals from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you released the document?
Ah, ah, yes.
"No, no, no, I'm waiting for one - that's a very ugly body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
It's not a big church anymore.
It no longer accepts those who express their thoughts.
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to accuse me, it was no longer surprising.
By the way, I was the last in line of Labour MPs who said we were not accepted - all because of the disclosure of our thoughts.
A similar treatment was received by my colleague in parliament Joan Ryan because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship petition pushed me to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, which in the past is, in fact, similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
The reminder for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, so did the GC meetings every Friday night.
Unfortunately today, this is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of a "more understandable, gentler" policy, if it really has ever begun.
It has become increasingly ironic that opposing views of the Labour party are not allowed and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's superiors.
It started as soon as Jeremy became leader, as the comrades began to rely on my first thought with a similar political view to me that I withdrew and took positions I would never agree with - whether in the national security or in the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak in front of the public - and no matter what I say - there's a next round of social media abuse that calls for deselection, criticises the politics of the middleman, and says I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm even happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are politically inclined.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of those who face the rampant abuse of sexist or racist every day but never back down.
One of the most controversial aspects of this era's politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week announced that the Labour party should cultivate the culture of reception.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every petition of "no-confidence" or a change in election policies, the party becomes more narrow.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years that I've encouraged myself to just bow down, not speak too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I wanted to do when I was in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, excited by Thatcher's government's neglect to leave my comprehensive school's classroom literally crumble, I have been trying to promote better public services for those who are more or less localized.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the previous election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the positions of my policy and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advanced the petition on Friday, all I want to say is, when the country plunges into a Brexit that will harm homes, the economy, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, one message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if not in my representatives, whether a member of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threat of deselection or political expedition will prevent me from acting in any way whatsoever on my behalf.
MP for Nottingham East and Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unbeatable Ayr rises to the highest
The final two tests also deflected the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win the amazing and comfortable match against the Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the unique unbeatable side of the ten.
Ultimately, their unique defense, such as their better chance-taking, brought home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've tried our games so far, and we still haven't lost, so I should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The nicest in Ayr, they had a better adventure than us."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo converted, put the Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors game, gave Melrose permission to score and got an unconverted Jagson.
Climo scored Ayr's lead in a penalty, before, exactly in the half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 on Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and was reduced by Patrick Anderson's try, with Baggot converting just five points.
Then, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, released by the striker, and from restart, Ayr advanced with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
A yellow card was given to Ayr's sitting captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the additional man to pay with an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a thunderstorm of fierce force.
However, the home side withdrew and when the yellow card was given Struan Hutchinson to tackle Climo without a ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down behind the advancing Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try of the home side.
Part of the Still Game, seems ready for a new career in the food industry
Still Game pitcher Ford Kieran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry, after it was discovered that he was named the director of a licensed food company.
Jack Jarvis played the 56-year-old on the famous BBC show, which he wrote and starred alongside his long-time comedy therapist Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be late for the run of the show, and that Kiernan appears to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun reporter suggested Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant trade."
'We are the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hopes to reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval base shelling the rigging at La Paz.
The public buildings are adorned with a flag as blue as the sea.
Sea wetlands from Lake Titicaca to Amazon were defended by the statement: "We have the sea according to the law.
It is a duty to restore it."
In the entirety of Bolivia's landlocked, the memory of a coast lost to the defeat of Chile in a bloody 19th-century practice of wealth - such as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those desires are at the highest level probably for several decades, as Bolivia waits for the decision of the World Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"There is a beauty, a sense of unity, and security in Bolivia, and it hopes, of course, with a positive view of the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, full of hopes that the tribunal in The Hague will grant Bolivia's request that - after decades of face-to-face talks - Chile be obliged to agree to give Bolivia a free rein.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - also has a lot to do with Monday's decision.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some authors believe that the court has little chance of deciding in favor of Bolivia - and that will change little if it does.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to deprive Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The case means "not complicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision in just six months after the hearing of the final arguments, said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on global law.
And far from the progress of the Bolivian struggle, it may have been prevented for the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has jacked up the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric undermined any remaining good will of the Chileans, he suggested.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represented Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the speed of court decision was unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 people who are not understanding when both sides benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not be able to disarm a nuclear weapon unless it can be trusted by the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to continue the pledges made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival nation.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be getting closer to the start of a resumption of nuclear diplomacy following a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un over three months ago.
Ri said it was a "serious dream" to humiliate North Korea by continually imposing sanctions and protesting the U.S. in a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington cautioned against agreeing to the declaration without taking any significant steps to reduce Pyongyang's weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the emergence of weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line of big headwear that will soon be released on a High Street near you
If you want to grow your collection of hats or stay covered by the sun, don't look for others anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have released a series of unique men's headwear for their SS19 runway collection so the style set in Paris Fashion Week has been amazing.
This summer, too many non-practical hats have spread on Instagram and these designers have brought their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's distinctive piece is a truly unique beige-coloured hat embellished with a wide brim of bird-clad wrap around the heads of models.
Other great decorations include a steep porch, a wizard's hat and also a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head from getting cold.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of odd masks that were right for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have tattooed lips and are much more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
There is a creation similar to scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while there is another cone-like cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue this wonderful fashion statement - you'll be lucky.
As a result, the large bonnets on the high street near you will soon be released.
The arrival of the growing hat following 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a brim of two floors and seen all dressed up from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski was postponed.
The cult label behind the over-the-counter hat spread on social media has once again sent another big creation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw that's almost as big as the swimsuit model with its handle.
The color burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied by a white leather handle, is the unique piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I hope to see the arrival of large hats and beach bags on high street next summer - because the size of the impression the designer made, it's hard to ignore the demand for large accessories.'
John Edward: The ability to speak a language that is important to the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintained the track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with the help of another board of excellent exam results, which only strengthened individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen career and place as a global citizen.
As a sector of education that designs and implements a rigorous curriculum in the school, we see modern languages continue as popular and preferred choice topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person with the language he understands, it's going to get in his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will come into his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we should not only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the forefront of league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students earned the Higher A mark in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German student, 69 percent of the French student and 63 percent of the Spanish student had also studied.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as chosen subjects, are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that for reasons given by employers for poverty fill vacancies positions, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary for young people to be ready for their future careers.
Along with increasing potential job opportunities that require knowledge of the language, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have an advantage in the future due to having a life skill like this.
People who can speak multiple languages will automatically have the advantage of having the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 people in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language enough and only French was spoken in a two-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
This is why it is important for young people today to invest in language teaching.
Having the ability in many languages, particularly in developing economies, will give young people a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, schools are different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK when the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there is always a language option in independent schools, with specialist teachers in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are focused on providing an environment suitable for teaching that will prepare young people and give them the ability to be successful, no matter what happens in their future.
It will not be denied at this time, in the area of global business, that language knowledge remains important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be regarded as "the ability to communicate globally."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and efficiency for the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans to see LeBron James' start for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James' minute play was likely limited.
Following rehearsals in the first part of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will begin a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scheduled rallies next week, including a visit to Allied locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for the confirmation vote for his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump's goal is to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to lead on hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about allegations of bribery while holding the expected Senate confirmation vote for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
However, the main goal of this rally is to help Republicans get momentum ahead of the tough elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week are focused on "acting with volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority holdings in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control in Congress is very important for his agenda to get the president to go to as many states as we can as we go into a busy campaign period," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said in a statement.
The rally is scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and can be delivered by supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get a report from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help senatorial candidate West Virginia Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is the catcher on the ballot.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey that the president needs to go to try and strengthen him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown courage to keep hope on Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may have needed this Ryder Cup.
A completely invented concept in the field of sports is the "swinging pendulum of momentum" but it is believed by players, especially in competitions like this.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They only have six points, and now they're only four, so we probably have a bit of momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left.
In Europe the advantage, of course, is only four points and the remaining twelve points.
Americans, Speith says, think they have a bit of a bow and a strong heart, because Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and there are three points from the four.
Spieth led his side and dragged him from tea to green.
The celebration's screams grew stronger as his round lasted, he put in an important putt to make a table in four matches after being two down after two with Thomas.
At the same time his putt that won them in the match at 15, the type of scream that says the match is not over for the American side.
"You just have to be careful and think about your own game," said Spieth.
This is the only thing left for every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players higher than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable Ryder Cup storyline.
Four from four and can't make a difference between the different but amazing couples from Europe.
"Molliwood" was the only couple who did not live in a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped from the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That abyss, and how their energy seems to flow from and to the deaf viewers proves that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and there are no more famous players who can determine a win for the Europeans at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible, go to different places.
However, the Europeans seem to have lost the battle.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the front nine landed in Spanish and Swedish, and they were no longer up.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It is convenient to watch fourballs and foursomes closely due to interactions between pairs, the tips given and not given, and the possible sudden change in strategy.
Europe's game is better as a group today and they are expected to move on to the final day but this foursome session has shown the strength and strength of Team USA that some, especially the Stateside, doubt.
Europe are expected to enter 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will only be strong on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out on Saturday from fourballs and foursome matches with only 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini led the stables with two wins against struggling Tiger Woods to bring their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The Europeans side which included Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the American side who missed the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more than foursomes, and won two matches but could not lower the odds.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a very good weekend, only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed were knocked out in the fourballs, they were amazed by the force's ability to defeat disillusioned Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in 5&4.
Woods, who pitched himself in two matches on Saturday, showed short-lived streaks of well-being but had already received a 19-out defeat in his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to defeat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third rank in the world.
The day did not turn out well for Europe even though the weather was clear and windy in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored an enthusiastic 2&1 win against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after being defeated in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has recovered from the four-point deficit will enter the singles, but as holders Furyk's side only needs the draw to maintain the trophy.
After two days of being second in the position, they seemed unable to cope with a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says 'no-no' unilaterally to disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that they were deepening their suspicion of the United States over continued sanctions and that the country would never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under this situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives around the world that North Korea had taken "important steps with good intentions" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and promising not to make nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"While there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under this situation we will not really unilaterally disarm."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of a "successful" denuclearization strategy in which North Korea will be honored as it takes small steps, his statement seemed to be important because it did not immediately reject the unilateral denuclearization of the denuclearization regime.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. President and North Korea's head of Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to secure North Korea's independence.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first surrender their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected demands to reduce strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is pushing for denuclearization" and lifting the weight of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent way, and they also oppose "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions will impose on us is a strong dream of people who don't know about us.
"But the problem is that we continue to have doubts."
Ri had no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced by the U.S. chief at the United Nations in the early part of the week.
Instead, the minister declared the three had become a meeting between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and the United States were not the party on this issue of disarmament of nuclear weapons, the nuclear deterrence would not lead to a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech differs dramatically from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on U.S. territory cannot be avoided after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "slow down" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time for this, and also said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honor Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly and without delay until we are fully aware of widespread, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has jointly imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying there had been a crackdown, only to be blamed by North Korea for making "gangster demands."
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States carried out "equivalent steps."
He said Kim had mentioned to him the "equivalent steps" he was looking for are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a path towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard, take a course on having enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates to sleep well as an attempt to combat the macho culture of study throughout the night as caffeine is enabled.
One academic learns that students at the world's number one university are often unaware of the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine teacher at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on the study.
'After that, a woman came up to me and said, 'Why didn't you say that to me, in my senior year?'
According to him, no one told him about the cost of sleep - which I was surprised by," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year the course has been released explaining to students the importance of having a proper sleep behavior and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to take the course after learning that students had been completely sleep deprived for a week.
A one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light, and how lack of sleep affects athleticism, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, which encourages participants to think about their other day-to-day activities.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know - like your right to know the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having ‘all-nighter' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students is raising the problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should serve as a ‘secret weapon' for students to combat stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he says - also to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, so they become hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class of his first year at Harvard.
He said he opened his eyes and had the inspiration to pursue a schooling course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask estuants to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should think about setting an alarm when to fall asleep and wake up, and find out the adverse effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's team
The Rangers again experienced disappointment after giving Dolly Menga's side Steven Gerrard a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first win in the opponent's stadium since they won 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, to hang his side eight points against the Premier League side in the Premier League final.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' line-up no longer seemed to be overridden by inspiration.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third and just behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
And there may be more problems waiting for the Rangers after the need to give a solution for the head injury to the lineman Calum Spence after the apparent stoning of something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight side changes to pass Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi 11 that scored against Hearts last week and he would have been happy with how his good team prevented their rivals from each turn.
The Rangers were superior in possession of the ball but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored two minutes after scoring close to Allan McGregor's goal Menga's pass to Scott Pittman but the midfielder pushed away.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was won by Craig Halkett but nothing could be done to defend him Alan Lithgow except to force the ball into the back post.
The Rangers have gained control but seem to think more than confident that their plan will be made in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick by a quarter of the game when Steven Lawless collided with them, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half of the game but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to defeat Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's apparent strike.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its debut even though the opponent looked better, they could not be denied there due to their scratch just yet.
The Rangers again failed to take action against the deep set-piece of the deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not take action when Declan Gallagher kicked the ball in the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action in the break when he traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and almost had a quick effect on the exchange when the winger was able to slot Morelos, but quickly ran from his line to catch Kelly's surprise.
But Livingston continues to make it difficult for visitors to play in the exact class of the game they want, where their long ball swings Lithgow and Halkett in succession.
Holt's side would have grown only in the final stages but McGregor could well have prevented Jacobs before Lithgow could have gone wide from the corner.
There was another last-ditch Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton for a penalty because Jacobs was involved, but Thomson did not look again.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and LET YOUR HEART BE... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany will be a physicist one day.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later transmit a device called a Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger Counter also became a major supporter of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring the seemingly blind cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that thing?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by radioactivity on the minerals."
Evans: "It's definitely sounding like it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name has continued to exist.
A new vaccine against cancer has taught the immune system to 'remove' the harmful cells
The new cancer vaccine has taught the immune system to 'remove' the harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from the patient, and improving them in the laboratory.
They will then be able to "live" the protein normally in most cancers and then inject them back into the body.
The vaccine tested gives good results to patients with a variety of cancers.
For more than 18 months, ovarian cancer of a woman being treated with the vaccine has been lost teaching the immune system to identify the harmful cells.
The procedure involves getting the immune cells from a patient, and improving them in the laboratory to "determine" them the protein that is common to most cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the cells.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results indicate that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
Treatment of the type of leukemia involves the same procedure of getting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to kill cancer cells.
Kanye West joined the Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a Magic Hat, After his SNL Release.
The result was not good
The "boo" represented Kanye West in the studio as she performed Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he wore Make America Great caps, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people many times and they say, 'How did you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
If I remember about racism, I should have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show with a kit featuring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star had fun with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Decisions about sexual exploitation complaints served by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the footage of West's criticism to social media.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to embarrass West in the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not stopped in the backstage about his hat.
"They threw me in the back seat.
They said, "Don't go out wearing that shirt."
They've bullied me!
And they said I was in the sink," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the sunken place?" when she said, she did "I wear my own cape or Superman, because that means, you can't dictate to me what I should do. Do you want to develop the world?
Try to have love."
Due to his comments, the audience was booed at least twice and cast members of the SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety's report, and there was one person there who stated in the publication that: "The whole studio was covered in silence."
West was inducted as the coveted purchase for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
Many were upset at West's performance of the song I Love It, where she dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: THANK YOU IN THE HIGHEST LEARNINGS OF THE GOLDEN PEOPLE."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just real and without a doubt amazing."
"But I choose NOT to recognize a person (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his 'art') who I think embraces and expresses the ideology that is associated with my community.
He had freedom.
"We're the same," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had already changed his name, saying he now "is formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
fellow rapper Snoop Dogg had the name formerly Snoop Lion and of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name and turned it into a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington strongly criticized the harmful masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his character Jon Snow in the legendary medieval fantasy series HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, strongly pioneered the stereotype of a brusque defender, according to him such roles on screen lead to the frequent thinking of young men that they need to be tough to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actor Rose Leslie, also 31, also admitted that she was "excited" about her desire to tackle the issue.
"It's my personal preference right now - where do we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in harmful masculinity due to its highly vibrant characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think that they need to be this kind of man?
I think, 'That's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change that?'
"There's something wrong with young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he will no longer make any prequels or sequels of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he said, "he's done in the fields of war and horse racing."
Starting in November, Kit will perform nude in Sam Shepard's re-release of the True West story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that they were getting to know Rose as the best thing that ever happened in the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show 'this, it's been a way for me to have a family in the future, and for my life to be from here,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who liked Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy award.
The two married in June 2018 in the grounds of Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
Around 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were passed through sexual intercourse, which marked a change from the past.
HIV transmission in some parts of China is usually rapid as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing every year to 100,000 people.
A chronic issue in China's LGBT community is HIV infection through sex.
The illegality of homosexuality in China was established in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is estimated that in studies 70-90% of men having sex with a man would eventually marry a woman.
Most of the infections in the disease are caused by a lack of sexual protections in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had disseminated data to GOP senators, and insisted on 'refutable lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia's pages for lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the "ultra-right wing" writers and websites had filed complaints.
"Lies, lies, and so many more brazen lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the information released included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill as the Senate panel heard allegations of sexual immorality against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came out a few minutes ago when three senators examined Kavanaugh.
In Hill's report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState that are linked to Waters's office announced the IP address that refers to the source of the posts and it provided information to Waters' staff member.
"It's a completely false and unsubstantiated accusation," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - who has compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - has nothing to do with the spread of this information.
It's completely wrong and a lie that has no basis for this accusation."
Waters's speech, which included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, was quickly retracted online.
"There is anger at this refusal," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that he does not have the necessary behavior of a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and respectful."
Fleischer came out comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too much of a laughingstock as the hearing was held on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running candidate, also expressed his views on Twitter to get Waters out of the midterm elections.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had already notified "the appropriate authorities and entities in the enforcement of the law on these fraudulent complaints.
"We will make sure to get to know the people who are competent," he continued, "and they will be responsible for the law for all the activities they do that are destructive and endangering anyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - denied spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now commonly looking for values for Brexit in any new British-oriented film and seems to fit in with the new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 in Johnny English and made a noise again in 2011 in Johnny English Reborn.
Could it be a new opportunity for the country to export the strange use of self-hatred on the subject of how remarkable our lack of understanding is?
In spite of everything, Johnny English's big-eyed and glamorous-looking unreleased has a license to re-shoot things for a second time - more than anything else, his name suggests that he is an expansive comic created for places where English is not spoken by viewers.
Of course, he is a mad secret agent who despite his strangely accepting to be swab elegantly has a bit of Clouseau's character, with Mr. Bean's personality and mixed by a portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire song theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he caused a riot in his mouth.
There's one or two good scenes in this latest JE show.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter as he was wearing a medieval veil and daglia hitting the rotor blades in his helmet.
Atkinson's talent can be seen in physical laughter, but excessive laughter has not been effective and has not become natural, especially with confidence now adding to its element of laughter the brands of "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
There was once a joke made that it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's comics were not as creative and as clear as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in Bean's persona.
The premise now experienced in the area for a long time is that Great Britain is placed in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker penetrated the highly confidential web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, causing disillusionment with the duty-bound agent - a debilitating little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing to ruin the prime minister who is a tall and generous person, who has already been suffering from complete anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson ruined the performance of this mala-Teresa-Maya character but was not too stubborn from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since all active spies had been compromised, he had to be returned from those who had already retired.
And what that refers to is the high school Johnny English himself, who now works as a head teacher at an exclusive institution, but gives private lessons on how to become an undercover operative: funny ‘this, because English gives the high-school of Rock an academy of scholarships.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and he was reunited with former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
Batman and Robin are back in action with the secret service of His Majesty's Secret Service, and they can meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously into the hands of the charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve the troubles on Britain's computer: the ill-fated Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough had already begun their long adventure with silly receptions: pretending to be waiters, they started a fire at an expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride without noticing Volta's luxurious yacht; and English was beginning a huge stir when Viryset tried to use the Realist.
There's no doubt that everything is neatly arranged in that last sequence, but even though it's comfortable and tight, there's a limit to being a kid's TV show as a whole.
Not a big thing.
And I can't stop myself from thinking about other Johnny English films: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that could bring justice to his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to have four days to work in a week but the British can pay them the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to have the Britons work four days a week - but they will be paid five days.
According to the party, they want the company's bosses to pass on those saved in major artificial intelligence (AI) changes to the workers by giving them an extra day's rest.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they can still get the same pay back.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and plans favoring the workers is 'absorbed'.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the four-day shift to a week's work as a way to give workers an opportunity to the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: "The announcement of the policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It can't be done overnight but four days a week of work is an ambitious goal of the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers and also for the overall strategy in the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party had promised to work four days a week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, today the Labour Party has not endorsed this goal as a whole.
According to a Labour Party spokesperson: "The party does not rule four working days a week and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour debate last week to further explain his dream for a revolutionary socialism in the economy.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he was forced to withdraw power from the 'unseen directors' and 'people exploiting the pipeline' in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get the full amount of their stake because the Labour government may impose "reducements" for prudent misdeeds.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the company's boards and build the Inclusive Ownership Funds that will provide 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if their minds could change in the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh
Due to the FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett, the final vote in his nomination to the Supreme Court was denied for at least a week, and there was a question as to whether the department's knowledge would cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything from the FBI's possible findings that could change their minds.
Kennedy became more open-minded than his fellow South Carolinaers.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said I was speaking with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘this, after the accusation came out, I said, 'Did you do ‘this?'
He's full of courage, he's determined, and he's not shy."
However, Graham's voice did not seem to change.
"My mind is full of Brett Kavanaugh and a big indictment will be needed for that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett would have rejected it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all the people he named will be able to confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is a Global Citizen's Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a huge amazing line-up of stars performing and having a similar amazing mission; the end of poverty in the world.
In its seventh year now, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by thousands of people who will gather in Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge for the true purpose of the event to end the 20-year drought.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by adding the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those going to the concert need to complete a range of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or anything that makes sense.
But how successful is the global citizen now that it has only 12 years left before it achieves its goal?
Is it a fair way to give people a free concert to appeal to people who encourage action or just add it to so-called "clickivism" - people feel they can make a real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Starting in 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging the host of various purposes.
In its words, these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to advertise provisions and insurance worth more than $37 billion that could make a difference in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early part of 2018, the group cited 390 provisioning and advertising derived from its action, and at least $10 billion of them were spent or used for funding expansion.
The group estimates that the insured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main providers include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the U.K. focused on "helping children grow up to discover their full potential," which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition after the pandemic.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can note in history the lack of social justice that is lacking in nutrition," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told people at the 2018 live concert in London.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 calls for the U.K. to provide nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and youth through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "how do you think we can end the hardship?"
The Global citizen replied: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like our predecessors, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together, and we will fight against the policy of segregation of whites.

The U.S. may use the Navy for "blocking the way" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able to "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia's bringing energy to the market, as well as the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, from the Washington Examiner said.
Zinke said Russia's interaction with Syria - particularly where it operates due to the legitimate government's invitation - was only a catchphrase for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy broker as they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belt of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure that their craft does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compares Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, the benefits and the exchange of energy," he said, while saying that "Russia has only one thing to do" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come out as the Trump administration promotes its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is buying Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, is why Moscow has become "controlled" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the pipeline's current capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin insisted that Washington's strong opposition to the project was driven only by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are both of the view that energy cannot be used as a tool for war and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has taken a strong reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its stance on the project.
The U.S. has called on Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when other states are involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Thinking Well" by Elizabeth Warren on running for president in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was "thinking carefully" about running for president following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include a woman as president," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm really thinking about running for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at such a meeting, saying that "this country is being taken in the wrong direction.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our economy," he said.
Warren had previously been vocal about his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's domains were not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent of the population supports such a process.
The sarbey showed more support for the run of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible run and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in connection with a possible run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentioned Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq, after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"As my son goes through his return, I understand other families who have experienced the results of PTSD and some of the feelings our soldiers have brought on their return," he told listeners at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a big problem he doesn't want to talk about" and said that his son and other veterans of the war were "going back a little differently, they were going back to violence, asking if there was respect for anything given to the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, particularly female harassment, involvement in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supported the issue of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal questioning of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the friend-of-the-court district provided a brief on Friday in Washington to support a person seeking asylum questioning the policy, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not disclosed against federal policy.
He said his partner had abused him "and his sons members of the bayonet gang," but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which is the source of a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "was ignoring many decades of state, federal, and world law."
"Federal law stipulates that all asylum-seekers will be judged on the basis of particular facts and facts of the case, and such a ban violates such principles," the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The lawyers further argued in the brief that the policy that denies entry of immigrants is ingrained in the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become businessmen and "support the need for workers."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear that is due to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
Asylum has never been provided to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate efforts to save Palu as the death toll to rescue survivors doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very sad," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her pregnant baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
There is no shortage of clean water."
When residents are seen returning to their ruined homes, they wrap their wet utensils, trying to save whatever they see.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are already overcrowded, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had acquired a back and shoulder injury, are resting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to sustained strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about how the very powerful earthquake in the room felt on the fifth floor of the hotel where his wife and daughter were staying.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck on the falling wall that was ‘that’,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my husband ask for help, after all, quietly.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I wish they were safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accused China of 'Terror' Using 'Advertising Propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four pages of advertising in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid speech on the Des Moines Register - the state's worst newspaper - after China was accused of interfering in the election for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, an accusation China denies.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election has been ready for U.S. officials to say in Reuters that a new phase of Washington's growing campaign to clamp down on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a deepening trade war where they have replaced tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariff hikes in the first phase of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now pressuring the press by releasing advertising propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's most cherished tradition of free speech and free expression by issuing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in the newspaper stores here in Beijing, you will see only limited dissenting voices and you will not see a real picture of Chinese differing opinions about China's disturbing economic direction, because the Chinese Communist Party holds tight to the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China abstained from the offer to publish" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans push away Women Voters Before Midterms in Kavanaugh's Troubles, Tagasuri warns
While many major Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn they will face intense reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about this are very intense, and it is evident to most registered Republicans that they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be ignored," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill.
Reeher said he was doubtful that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be sufficiently supportive of the FBI's investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the modern group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they rallyed in the Senate aisle because Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unusual," Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; that's true.
But it may even rise, especially for swing voters who are women in out-of-town spots and for young voters, about 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, although they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, investigators say there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continue the confirmation.
"This has been a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or a targeted vote or whether Kavanaugh is sitting, it's about how Republicans handle this issue and how they trinate him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, the Americans seemed to be coming out to share who believed in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, the more few sided with the latter.
The new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after swearing last week that the drunk Kavanaugh had abused him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his king while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor's plan to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a startup that aims to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will be allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee boldly stated that the purpose behind Inrupt was to "take over the whole world."
"We need to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is completely controlled by the user who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "powering itself through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company methods, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a complete change will come out where all their business models will be completely reversed one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this in the next season of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy winner of the Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross in World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never found out that he had won the highest military honour in Britain.
A stone guard was removed from the tomb by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that "a bright symbol" would expose the stone 100 years after his grandfather's celebrated work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion crossing the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick hammock as the bullet was projected from the fields and machine guns."
Later, he went to the first line and led the line forward with "greatest courage" before starting with a field-gun and single-handedly knocked out three of the team.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I couldn't stand but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also dedicated the flowerbed after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it is an honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans don't sleep at night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig watch them
Think about it, you wake up at night to watch the Bellator 206 but you're not allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and aired live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare for their presentation, viewers in the UK were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some people are disappointed that they have to wait until the end of the day to fight.
A Twitter fan said the move to the young cartoon "looks like a bad joke."
"The government policy that at 6 a.m. it was inappropriate to watch such a show so they had to move to the young show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they would arrange their schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, it's Monday.
But we are fixing it.
Believe me, when they moved there, a lot of repetitive text and all of it got angry.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was technical glitch.
But no, it has to do with the government.
I promise it won't happen again next time.
We'd only do five against instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give the fans away but we were overwhelmed.
It's just really a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘down' due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this prompted him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think about it until he got to high school that "not everyone is like him."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs to be censored by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that his desire to win the Olympics has been reduced.
The regular inmate on the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months due to illness.
Coming out as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "feel lower" than others as she grew up because "it's not easy to accept the likes of both men and women in society."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I feel less, and feel that I'm different, are the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He was right to prove that he was "different," he said, so he didn't change everything when they found out about his sexuality later.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics became a high-profile campaigner for LGBT and used his release at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries from crime to homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt he was fortunate enough to live without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he would love a man - the US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said the gap had never been a problem.
"When you're going through a lot at an early age" - he first joined the Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer after three years - he said it was difficult to find a person of age who experienced both happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the only thing that matters is, 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of his last questions was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front seat.
"I can't tell him you're not going to sit in front of him anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he was really breathing and dead that he really accepted that I didn't bother him," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her first-choice song - Proud of Heather Small - that echoed her at the upcoming Olympics and still built on her hair.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday and 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not eligible for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to adjust his condition to avoid it becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time record, was built by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as often happens to him for the United States, a five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and practicing in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Since he never became the most direct driver even during the height of his career, the 48-year-old was not fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where false shots were often problematic in the long rough.
And it didn't seem like the hard course was enough, Mickelson was still facing, in the ninth match of the week, the British Open's incumbent champion Francesco Molinari, who joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down four points from 12 singles matches, start hot, Mickelson's fight may be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, kicked me in the back and guided me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was a Hall of Famer and has been added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I dreamed more, but that was what happened and ‘that’s what we thought we were going to do.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup match of the week.
It could mark the end of the Ryder Cup race that has never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 threes, and seven tables, though Furyk said his presence brought some unseen benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke about people, and he's good with the team room," he explains.
"I think it's going to be a lot of fun to play with him this week, and it's a lot of fun to watch.
It's more than just playing."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that only the big ones are going to be lost soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows, based on the experience that it's easy to lose big singles in the final day of the Ryder Cup and can be uncomfortable fighting it out.
Denmark started in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain took only five-pointers to the Americans but missed the finish line because the margin was too small, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that we were only big at Valderrama; we were just big at Brookline, and we lost there, and at Valderrama, we won, but we did win," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead the National 10-6 Leggings.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over yet.
You'll get everything tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until you can put the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's the attempt to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will stay.
I've said before, I'll focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best player in the world."
Glad to have his players perform in the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not leading myself here.
Tomorrow there will be other monsters.
Open individual performances can be seen, and that is a different activity.
It's nice to get out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you can test the limit of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to understand the players, to release everything you can tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get everything he can."
Compared to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better as an individual than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of major changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing when Europe showed "Miracle and Medinah."
"I remember every word here," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you've seen at Brookline, as you've seen at Medina.
When going in one direction the wave ‘that’, it carries a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're releasing the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the beautiful game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"That's what I've done with the group of these players because I think it's the best until the end," Bjorn told his picks for the singles.
Germany's new government has been re-elected
Germany's latest frigate in 2014 should have been commissioned to buy old warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not be until next year due to system failures and rising costs, local media reports.
The raid on the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the head ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be included in the Navy in 2014, but the major project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 would be replaced with the old Bremen-class frigates.
They clearly have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer retention period - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate power overseas - will be old-fashioned when they enter the service, said Die Zeit.
The lucky F125 frigate became the head of the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited some "defects of essential software and hardware" that would make warship useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software shortages are especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, the ship turned out to be too heavy to reduce its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same ship types used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the latest frigates are becoming more and more important due to recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
In the early part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "depleted with ships that could still be deployed."
The official said that the issue had grown over time, as the old ships had been removed but no delivery ships had been given.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were associated with the Navy.
The National Trust's mission is to protect the lives of refugees
The purpose of the new research carried out outside a Scottish Highlands estate is to reveal how bats use the landscape in their food search.
It is expected to shed light on the behavior of strange flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano batilles as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and mobile survey volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The sound analysis experts at all recording confirm the frequency of the bat's fangs and which species makes which sound.
Then, a housing map will be made to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to find out the benefits of residential management activities such as the creation of a field and what is the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
There has been a significant decline in the bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK over the past century.
They are at risk from construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Air-powered turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated by building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and pests along the path they travel.
NTS bats are important, which is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has trained experts, who regularly practice sarbeys, inspect nests and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only proposed reserve land for Scottish bats at the Threadave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
The estate manager David Thompson claims that the estate is the best territory for them.
"We've got a great place to stay," he said.
"We've got old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good housing.
But much more is not known about bats, so what we are doing here and with other properties can help us understand more about what they need to keep living."
He emphasized the importance of inspecting if there are bats before performing a memento within the property because it is possible that accidental destruction of at least one mother's nest could kill 400 females and young bats, which could potentially destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, fertilize or crush them or destroy their nests.
Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust Elisabeth Ferrell was encouraged by the public to help.
He said: "We have much more to learn about our bats and we don't know the climate of the population of many of our species."
Ronaldo does not pay attention to rape charges as lawyers prepare to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him as "good news," saying there are people who "want to encourage themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's forward and Juventus were accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
While speaking on an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "bad news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying is fake news now," said the camera five times that won the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to use my name for themselves.
That's normal.
They wanted to be famous so I mentioned my name, but it was just a job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage at the cost of the burden of intrusion, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place allegedly in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to papers served on the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo stepped down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" was "a kind man" who was beaten by "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but both of them liked it.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and the photo took his injuries to a hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement because he was "feared of retaliation" and worried he would be "disgraceful to the public."
The 34-year-old claims that he is now seeking to overturn the order because he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo joined Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK's 'life-long regret' about the loss of automakers
The UK's "lifelong regret" if it loses its status as the world's leader in vehicle manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the US without a deal it would temporarily expand production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese said the vehicle was producing that the impact of the border delay in the event of no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of them were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March it will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have issued their fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how trade will work on borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the US for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be border disruption that the industry says could result in delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the U.S. was "prepared well to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow not only to enjoy success at the moment but to benefit from this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to be able to fully continue any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota can't say how long production will last, but warns that in the long run, additional costs will reduce the plant's ability to compete and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said: "In my experience, in the moment of loss, these jobs can no longer be restored.
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with a correct and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trumpat's very important meeting of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "rescheduled another week" as the problem continues with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, Trump's and Russia's aides' relations and possible obstruction of the president's justice.
For several months, it has been debated whether Trump will blame the deputy attorney general, and whether Mueller's independence is at stake.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing the wire to record their talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" condemn Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid the Senate Judiciary Committee's opposition to hearings where both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which was further delayed by the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no set date for that, perhaps this week, it may be postponed for another week because of all the other things going on in the supreme court.
Let's keep an eye on it and keep the press up-to-date."
Several reporters object to what he said: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the While House since 10 September.
The host asked Chris Wallace why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to dislike of TV reporters' "disgusting," though he said: "I'm not congratulating them very much."
He then indicated that there was a growing direct relationship between Trump and the press.
"Q&A sessions make the president more than his predecessors," he said, adding without the aforementioned evidence: "We look at these numbers."
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States himself, that's better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it'll replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or engaging in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president has perhaps shown why, in showing lack of formality and sometimes odd looks in front of reporters.
Health secretary wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU staff working with the NHS of Scotland to express gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter today less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has promised to guide the value of applications for settled status for EU citizens working on its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "Last summer, talks between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, hopefully there will be decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stressed its preparations for a possible no-deal.
I know this is a worrying time for all of you.
So I want to repeat now how important each person's hug is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that reinforce and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Sumailalim in Emergency Operation After Getting Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was sent to the emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in the defeat on Saturday 31-27 at Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a few moments before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and just fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by the trainers and medical staff on the sideline before he was put on the stretcher and taken for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/range of injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out where the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore redshirt, is in his first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers of property in the UK will be charged with higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and will use additional money to help the homeless under Tory's new plans.
The move would counter the success of Corbyn's will to attract voters
Increase in the number of non-residents in the UK
Myanmar expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to charge a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and will use the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
The move will be seen as countering the success of Jeremy Corbyn's will to encourage young voters to make promises that will provide affordable housing and reward those who earn big.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to support the Government's desire to sleep on the street.
The surcharge - which was added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary housing and in homes purchased for rent - can be increased by three percent.
Kabang-Yaman expects this step to accumulate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties are bought by non-residents of the UK, which increases prices so it becomes more difficult for buyers to buy a house for the first time.
Many rich places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because many foreigners buy nothing in the country most of the time.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to help young people in the right age to buy their first home.
He blamed the major construction companies for the continued high price of the property by buying land but did not use it, and urged Mrs May to tighten the quotas on affordable homes to fix the "familiar housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced the attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending evictions for "no reason".
He also wanted to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would provide my premiership in restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that there is a problem in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
However, it's not so easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes like a hard-working British resident.
Too many people dream of having a home, and the lack of sleep on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition most of all is the government of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ambience above all" is to be Scotland's ruler when the sun comes up.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's ‘that'," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was always someone calling me back.
That's the only way I'll be successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's ruler included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he is not afraid to follow the so-called big club names, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The victory for me at this moment will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the organisation and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to bring it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross was only three years in his management career, after being assistant boss at Dumbarton and being part of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from a fall in the third tier, and changed St Mirren from batting down to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he used to when he was playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It must have been a mess," he recalls of the management of Alloa.
"I really believe that management is more important to me than playing.
I felt like I was playing a good game, so I had a good time and had a good time.
But it is difficult to play.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I still go through that when it comes to stress and pressure at work but the management is just fine.
I'm always looking for the boss and now I'm doing this, it's the most comfortable feeling I've felt in my entire life as a teenager."

According to sarbey, 5:30pm on Saturday is the best time for a pint
The hot summers have increased the sales of struggling pubs in Britain but have brought more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA said that he was the one who collected the figures: "Continuing sun exposure and the longer England's expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed what happened in June, when the sales of pubs rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were much stronger.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that drink the main merchandise are strongest, and by comparison the two seasons, they are higher than the drop in restaurants.
The summer effect on food pubs is also not as good as the main goods, although not as good as that of restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
Of the pubs and bars run, alcohol sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of the RSM said of leisure and hospitality analysts: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social events or empowerment remains the biggest factor affecting the market advantage of those outside their homes.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants are still struggling, and the drop in sales by 4.8 percent each year will be even more painful when it is added to the continued pressure of expenses.
It's not a good time for a long hot summer for food operators and only time can tell if the situation will improve with the arrival of the colder temperatures we experienced in August."
The overall increase in sales at pubs and restaurants, including new ones tomorrow was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in the release of brands.

One in five children have secure social media accounts that they don't tell their parents
One in five children - some just 11 years old - have secure social media accounts that they don't tell their parents and teachers, according to the survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rise of the "fake Insta" page
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that was shown to parents.
One in five children - some just 11 years old - are making the social media accounts that they are insecure from the elderly.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account that was shown to parents, while they also had private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old son's secret site found a teenager urging other people to "save me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of about 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "vote for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government branch.
Doyle was the track and field athlete in Scotland with the most wins and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a good opportunity for game managers to benefit from his extensive global experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect for sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland will greatly benefit from bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games with his total of four golds at the Olympics and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month now since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time can tell if I'm okay or at what level.
It was hard work but I was completely healed, I was studying again how to walk and now I'm exercising to be lazy!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Heart is the internet's opinion on advertising for breast pump where mothers compare to cows
The breast pump company shared an opinion on the internet because of the advertising in which the breastfeeding mothers compared to the milked cows.
To mark the launch of what they say is "the world's first ever silent wearing breast bump," the company Elvie released a humorous music video advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw in the play with accompanying lyrics such as: "Yes, I respect myself but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed I'm not rooting for 'those, those are my breasts".
The chorus continues: "I'll beat, beat, beat babies, beat, beat, beat, I'll beat my boobs."
The announcement, however, has sparked controversy on the internet, which has already been published on the company's Facebook page.
There are already 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it overwhelms the "terrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's really not a good decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
We need them to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, so their offspring are only a few days away from birth," said one.

Another commented: "First traumatic for mother and baby.
"Why don't you use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who are not distant from their babies?"
Another added: "There's no such thing as an advertising campaign."
Some of them were in favor of the song, but a woman said the song was "funny" for her.
"This is an idea for me.
I'd buy it if I was still pregnant.
I feel like I'm really feeling pumped up.
Advertising is also a bit of a mess, but I think it is.
"It's a product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their jobs or buckets) and feel like "bovines."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women will announce that they are all dancing with uninvited pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump milk say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bra undetected, so the women are more mobile, they can handle their babies more easily, and can even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD commented on Mother: "The Elvie Pump is a big change so it should be given a bold and exciting launch.
Compared to pumped women and cows we wanted to be able to pay attention to the pumping of milk and all the difficult things about it, while showing in a comfortable and first-hand way the great comfort brought by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has become the head of news.
During London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother filed for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Child Migrants Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of displaced migrant children has increased despite the fact that the monthly crossing of the border remains unchanged, part of which has become more difficult to place children in sponsors as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration.
Typically, most of the sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid that they will be able to challenge their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
The risk increased this June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household had to submit fingerprints, and share data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor children without a partner.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individual sponsors or family members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to pursue such individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials have implemented new policies that will order them to appear in court during a month of detention, rather than 60 days later, which is the former standard, according to shelter workers.
Many are faced with a video conference call, rather than a personal one, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Decisions that are not qualified for help are quickly deported.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to be upset or sad, which can lead to intense anger or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Supporters said that those concerns were stronger in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's distress are likely to be undetectable, due to its size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare for their emotions or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many have already experienced.
U.S., France and Turkey 'subsidiary forces' have been ordered to leave Syria immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the stay of foreign forces in Syria's territory was illegal, prompting the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more had to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight the sacred battle until both terrorist groups and "any foreign presence that is unlawful" are removed from all Syrian territories.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "a few western countries" for "spreading unwarranted fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the global community and charitable organizations to step up these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing the full working issue."
The United States and the European Union are warning that there is no aid for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large fort of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
With the agreement of Russia and Turkey, a large-scale attack by Syrian forces aided by Russia in the province, in which three million people live, was avoided.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear flaws" and expressed hope that the military action would destroy jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members will be held to write the basic law after the war for Syria and allow the election.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of current fundamental law," and warning against intervention.
Why Trump won the second term.
In that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again except, as many liberal viewers would probably expect, if his presidency were to end early in the impeachment and scandal.
In an undoubted "dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Today, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, in addition to doubling, prime-time ratings have risen to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly triple to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable ratings in the sum of 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol collapsed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she's laughing at me,'" Ms. Scovell said to me.
The confusion is confusing.
Of course, unlike others on TV, stories from Washington could affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families reunite, and the health of the global economy.
What you can't hear is a smile that can only be done by the richest viewers.
But beyond being a citizen's wisdom when you're six hours away from watching the Washington panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," in Paul Manafort's $15,000 bomber jacket made on the skin of the oyster, the swastika ("the swastika").
If I were you, I'd have a different view of Super Mario.
"Part of what he's doing so for this reality show is because he's giving you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the rotating cast of Trump's show and the day-to-day change in the story.

When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was in-record.
He could not leave the show, especially Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to appear on the Senate Judiciary Committee and suspended the future of the Supreme Court.
"I was impressed when we were doing the funny shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money from the outside flounders in the most intense fight in Congress in midterm elections
Unsurprisingly, cash was flowing in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to the change in congressional districts that resulted in fighting the two current seats for the same position.
It recently re-elected Pittsburg district Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which the new 17th actually adopted.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January that the old districts were manipulating contrary to the basic law to favor Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th began a campaign fund fight between the main party's governing branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a special election in March watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican had held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats very little.
U.S. Balanced Punishment in El Salvador Due to Support in China, Then Backs
Diplomats have confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's governing team.
State Department officials have decided to return American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, were only taken into account, including for narcotics controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include financial aid violations and targeted visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and at the high levels of unemployment and death there.
As the internal meetings began to take place, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow up on a similar one-year meeting that was seen as a step forward towards a United States embargo.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak at the conference, to be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic quietly without a new strict message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on the condition that they were not named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outsider close to the administration and also spoke on condition that he was not named.
Studying the history
The next event was the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice, which now has a lot of evidence on the public record.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is now turning his investigation into whether Trump's campaign in Russia has been compromised in its attack on our electorate.
If the incumbent changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this branch, as he prepares to re-elect, and perhaps eventually face a jury made up of his peers.
There are a lot of them, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall - or his loyalties to Europe - can't be avoided.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will make a lot of decisions that will affect how long the practice lasts.
In 1938, the Germans were prepared to make a coup d'état against Hitler, had the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next three years of bullying.
The course of history revolves around such points of directional change, and the unstoppable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change today.
What will we do if Mr. Trump accuses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
It is in doubt that Rosenstein originated when this newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly suggested re-recording the president and even gave speculation that the president was not fit for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new F.B.I. inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, the winter of democracy will be prolonged.
But I don't think we'll fall because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my home as an ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit me the Sabbath candles in that table with a swastika mark.
Because of that, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following Spain's impressive table against Villarreal in the first part of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury stopped midfielder Graham Dorrans from coming out of the season to a 2-2 draw at Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use that result as an incentive to bigger things.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," the 31-year-old said.
"We came into the game believing we could get something and came out with points.
We might have gotten it later, but, overall, the table has probably had a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, it was a big night in Europe.
We hope we get three points but the game will be difficult because they have a good result in their last game, but we support the people, so I'm sure we will fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened to me in my injuries and changes to the club itself but there was a good feeling in the area today.
The team was great and the members really enjoyed it; the training was good.
We hope we can fight now, win the last season and be successful."
Women's rights are threatened by the fear of retirement
Despite the fact that sarbey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, only a few people talk to members of their family about it.
About half of the number of individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't say your preferences early.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how care will be taken, as these decisions will be of great value.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help meet these expenses or insure yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a proxy for health care so that you can dedicate a reliable individual to manage your medical care and make sure that the professionals follow your preferences in case you are unable to speak.
You should also consider having the power of attorney for your finances.
Trusted people will choose you to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid when you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan for you to be prepared.
"It's not just money, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot several times using an air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, who was about 40 years old, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a deliberate act."
The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to the witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Palu city on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communications lines broken down, no information was available to the officials of the agencies providing assistance from the Donggala regency, an area just north of Palu closer to the epicenter of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency with over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The 2017 population of the regency is estimated to be 299,200, which is an administrative region that is lower in the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economic indicators of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
The tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is in the inundated part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died off the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Many people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, which began a tsunami hitting the southern coast, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the town of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which began a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of points and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing damage and fear as people remember the destruction caused by the massive earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no subsequent tsunami this time, but more than 100 died due to the collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists in temporary distress.
Sarah Palin's parents arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of torture.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone from him.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and in custody based on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "guilty, sure" when asked about his defense, a network report.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also incarcerated by Class B misdemeanour, with a one-day jail sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal cases.
In December 2017, he was accused of hurting his father Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was subjected to family harassment, interference in the reporting of family violence, and armed robbery while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him that Palin hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was first seen by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent act to PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude tsunami earthquake and thousands of houses have been destroyed.
Power was cut and communication lines broken and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the centre of Sulawesi in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The videos on social media show the moment the earthquake struck.
Hundreds of people gathered to enjoy the beachfront of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York have demanded the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that eight people have killed -- a rare punishment that has not yet been enforced in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used the Home Depot's rental truck to carry out an attack on the bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which would alert people who were walking and cycling along its path in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors had to prove Saipov's "will" to kill eight victims and "will" cause serious harm to the body, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was served in the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to be overturned by the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed against Saipov of 22 perfect with eight counts of murder supporting torture, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and accused of violence and destruction of de-motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of implementing it as "scared-up, cruel and blunt of the party."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov has caused pain, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade that dates back to when the Southern District of New York investigated the death penalty case.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple were hanged after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg was hanged in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek tuber, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had the inspiration to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to perfect.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He didn't have a perfect 22.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma these events cause in all cases," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team initially asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should rule Brexit negotiations, according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians needed to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said in Birmingham's March that the UK "would have come out now" if Mr Farage had been the Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's future challenge to reconcile her hapless group was emphasized by Tory's involvement in favor of staying in a separate protest against the city's Brexit.
The prime minister has struggled to keep the course of his Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks from Brexit favours, who want to stay and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the bad reaction - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and the "disruption."
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'read the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we need to break the Chequers."
In a statement, he said: "We are not fighting the world wars just to be consistent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone ignores suggestions that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds is not entirely true and they want to stay."
Tory in favour of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The public doesn't want the Chequers, the Opposition won't vote for it, our party and our activists don't want it to be who walks the street and governs us.
Please don't forget to check out the checkers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said that rally politicians must "feel the pressure" if they intend to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about trust between us - people - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to leave Brexit and we're here now to tell them 'we're not going to let you do that.'
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, who intend to back Brexit.
"We are moving the people's army in this country that has given us success in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, govern ourselves, the United Kingdom of Great Britain."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in Birmingham marched before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
There are a number of activists waving banners of Tory Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis narrowed the Conservatives down due to security issues they experienced in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can put IT systems and all technologies for Canada and many more, for no border fence, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just a laugh.
"There is nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think carefully" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "thinking carefully about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future in a town hall in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He is in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting in the area using the format of the town hall since Trump's sitting.
One of the participants asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and include a woman as president."
A man has been arrested after the death of Sims of LSU
Police announced in Baton Rouge, La. on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting and murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help recognizing the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got the right shot in the head that he killed," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defends his friend and Simpson shoots him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in the crime scene, holding a handgun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after team orders gave him the win from Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the role of the Mercedes" team order in the race would be huge.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and nearly left Hamilton in his defense in his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to play his teammate.
Vettel first stopped the pit and left Hamilton to go traffic to the group's end, something that should have decided the result.
Mercedes pushed past a lap and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a collision in which Ferrari's driver hesitated to leave the guts free of risk to continue to defend after a double-move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh in the late band of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a major part of the race as he continued to run to target the quick finish and lead Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
He eventually stopped pitting in the 44th lap but failed to accelerate his run to the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri has done well all weekend and has really made me a gentleman and given me a lot of time.
The team has done a remarkable job to have one-two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Flow of the Body ‘That’s
President Donald Trump slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for his insistence that he did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "violent and evil and lying."
"One thing that can happen and the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and cruel and evil and lying," he said.
"When you see the shows and the revelations after they say, 'Ah, I'm not the one doing that.
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who baptized?
Remember his answer... did you publish the document - "Ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't baptized."
Take it easy.
"No, we're not the only ones," he added, as he looked at the president.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had made the announcement.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he asked."
But his previous rejection of the president was not good, commenting on the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's a really bad body move.
Maybe he didn't, but 'that was the worst body movement I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who gets hurt to get power," the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned to defeat the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two early goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie crossed the home side before Dwyer returned only to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard skips the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals scored the victory.
This was the third three in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's people, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth presentation of the season by two sides, winning the Giants in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave the assist as Beauvillier doubled just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan returned home from the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's face at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to lead the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard beat them again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee only for the first time in the game in the latter part of the second period and he secured the win in the fifth half of his team until the final period.
The Giants, who are now three of their last five games, will return home and head to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died While Confirming That Earthquake Could Survive the Plane Road
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was called a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to blow the area and many were trapped in the destroyed buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the residential control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu Airport.
He left to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321 was able to fly safely, which was on the runway at the time.
He then jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He eventually died in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that that decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reports.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We are deeply saddened by this news," he added.
Authorities are afraid that the death toll could reach thousands, according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, limited access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number is still rising because many more bodies are under collapsed buildings while others are not reachable," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed the Palu to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
In turn, military and commercial aircraft are being supplied with assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with bodies.
There is no shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being looted all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, president of Indonesia's International Red Cross, told CNN: "Red Cross is working in Indonesia to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every evacuation effort.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first part of this year by the Lombok earthquake in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crashes: According to Air Niugini, a man was missing after the plane crashed into the lake
The airline that operates the plane is said to have crashed into the Pacific lake in Micronesia with one man missing, after first being told that all 47 passengers and personnel were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a male passenger was not found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all fine with the condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed at the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a really nice thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk in the water to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants were scared and screaming, and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said it was also helping rescue the smugglers who arranged the port nearby by using a sinking boat to take people to the beach before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades but no Air Niugini has been involved.
The story of a woman who was shot dead in the night
The prosecution concluded its argument on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of life-threatening burns on a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the phone records to track the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed up with Tellis on the night of his death, which contradicted Tellis' previous statement, reports Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the man's phone was to Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford was beaten on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another non-conformist was what Tellis said about two weeks he knew Chambers when he died.
Based on phone records, they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis broke Chambers' texts, calls and contact information on his phone.
"She killed the girl in her life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to go to trial that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
Three hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, which is from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from the origins of its political message and response to societal issues.
They want to go back to their roots and rekindle the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
A New York Times reporter has accused a man of being fired after "racist" text
A New York court has sued the couple for discriminating against her for dismissal after receiving a mistranslation text from the mother claiming she was "black again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and compared the lawsuit to the "rejection."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, with two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman after she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"INDIIIIIIIIIIITHIM NAMAN," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her text to her husband.
So instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "disgusted" Ms. Maurice, saying that their former stepfather, who was an African-American, had not done well, and that he expected to be a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day at work and returned home to Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for severance pay, and demands payment of $350 per day for six-month, stay-in work he would have done, even if there was no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know this is discrimination."
The couple, in turn, retaliated against the accusations that they were racist, saying that Maurice's dismissal from the job was reasonable, fearing they would not trust him after they hurt his feelings.
"My wife sent me a text that she didn't really want to say.
He is not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's wife told the Post.
"But will you trust your children to someone you've spent your time with, even if it's not intentional?"
Your new-born baby?
It's not "no."
Comparing the lawsuit to the "finger," Plasco said that it was only two months after the birth of his wife and "too much difficulty in the situation."
"You're looking for someone like that?
“That’s not good,” added the investment banker.
As the case continued, the public quickly sued the couple on social media, putting their behavior and logic first.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't like the talking bear, unveiling new letter
Says about Bond's son Karen Jankel's letter, which was born shortly after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's exciting to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
He would still trust even if his work was rejected, he said of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before gaining inspiration from the little bear toy who wrote the book as a youth, and added that the book's 60th anniversary was "happy and sad" after his death.
He described Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and added that his father was proud of the success in the end.
"He's a quiet man, and he can't be bothered," he said.
"But because Paddington is true for him, your child seems to have achieved something: you're proud of them even if you're not the one doing it.
I think that's what he thought of Paddington's success.
Although he created it and imagined it, he then gave Paddington the honor of being himself."
I was on the phone when my son died.
After the crash his son was rushed to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"Nad called to say that she was truly ill, that there was no hope of her survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then, I received a call from Nad saying that he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, son.
I'll be there soon.
We'll be with you.
He gradually loses his strength and loses in his body the drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart pumping.
He died before he died and “that’s all that’s been shot down.
I can't just sit there and wait, as long as I know all this is happening.
I can't cry or cry because there are so many people and families around me.
I had to stop everything."
Later, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was then mourning her son's departure, boarded the plane with other passengers - unaware of what he was going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I'm just sad, I don't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt overwhelmed by Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know he loves his son."
Women's rights activists put cards in place to stop the abuse of women's rights
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide as well.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on the Welsh bridge of cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son hopes to become a chef with a refreshing smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile was good."
So he left the job before he died, because "he was so sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I have always been concerned that it would have an impact."
Ms Davis made the cards, "to tell people there's something to go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut up - you need to talk to someone."
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms Davies for several years, was left by Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's departure.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
It's sad that he was sad on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he couldn't keep up with them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to accept it: "It's really a huge loss of family.
We were shocked.
We all have to go on and fight."

The next day Brett Kavanaugh hung as the FBI began the investigation
"I thought, if we could do as he asked - an investigation in a limited time, limited scope - there would be at least some unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "extremely" in the midst of the parties' ousting.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
It's because of their time.
Just five weeks into the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be too weak in their attempts to recognize what they want people in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the Senators, talking to them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through this he met his wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has made its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the vote table and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'defective' number goes down under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un sat down seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said it was a big deal to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and to higher charges by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most of the defectors from North Korea were offered later by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, with the longest border with North Korea and an easier border than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
It has greatly reduced the last few months of relations between North and South - which in fact are still at odds.
In the first part of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on delayed negotiations related to denuclearisation.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Singapore's Kim Jong-un in June, when they agreed on general terms for the agreement to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of settlement since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we would never be able to make wealth disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "too horny," not worthy of serving in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "too horny" and said because of his behavior he was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman does so, they'll say 'too loud,'" Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming on several occasions and crying as he discussed his family and his years in high school.
He also condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "hateful and co-ordinated criticism" that liberals angered Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony convinced him that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he was not in favor of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself in those statements and in the way he condemns the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the Lower Assembly.
"I'll say it -- if he's not telling the truth in Congress or the FBI, it means he's not worthy not only of the Supreme Court, but also of the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
On hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a deaf and dumb person to go to court and hopefully we'll say, 'Isn't that a nice 'that'," Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It's a fair trial, many months and years of anger abound, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I think it's just normal, isn't it?"
She continues, "A woman executive helped me a lot in one place, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she did a way that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he continued.
I think “that’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a way of expressing anger because first of all, they are misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I was crying with unrelenting anger, was punching me in the neck of an older woman - an angry manager I was always afraid of - and dragged me down a stairway.
"Don't let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy to cry for you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, had already worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run-offs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on his wife in a boat called Monkey Business and backed off the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for him not to think he was running for president himself.
"It's not really a good idea to think 'that'," he told me when he laughed 30 years ago.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another one.
One person called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign began a long time ago, he was left behind in fundraising, so he promised not to participate in the fight unless he could raise $2 million.
That fight was not a win-win.
He discovered that some of his supporters who would give $1,000 to men would only give him $250.
"Do you think they're going to give me a break?" he asked.
When he spoke and announced he would not launch a formal campaign, he ended up emotionally - thanks to the people who supported him, disappointment in the system where it was very difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at gender discrimination - so he cried.
"You think I've had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled what the press's reaction was to her.
"I'd like to see Kleenex sponsoring me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my lap?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could improve in Beijing
The initial outbreaks of the trade war between the US and China are striking, and although the conflict is far from over, Beijing may well have a dispute between the countries in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning in the first part of this year by imposing taxes on China's major exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week comes the biggest increase in new tariffs affecting the $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which in fact imposes a tax on half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing operates every time, the latest being the imposition of a tariff of five to ten percent on $60 billion of goods from America.
China has promised that the U.S. will rely on every move it makes, and it is likely that the world's second-largest economy will not be tackled in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it would have to give up the demands, but the US's public outcry would be a disgrace for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still say that if Beijing acted properly, China's support for U.S. trade war pressures would be positive in the long run by lowering the level of interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would initiate economic integration in either of the two countries, is more dangerous than what observers have previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the country's resurgence that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions had improved in the country.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to make rehabilitation in areas that terrorists have destroyed in order to restore everything back to normal.
There are already all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was open to help resurrect the devastated country.
But he insists that it will not receive aid with conditionality or assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has won the Ryder Cup in Europe six times in a row since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson's tee-shot, who struggled throughout the tournament, fell into the water at par-3 16th hole, and he accepted defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming a 1–4 player to have a 5–0–0 start since the start of the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5–4 by the lowest-ranked European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have been in his last Ryder Cup game.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful tournament of all time at his 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry but now I can't stop.
This man has become difficult.
So I'm grateful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I'm happy to have the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following a victory in Europe.
He passed the job on to his compatriot John Ram who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic by one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles that only double Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we had a bit of difficulty in Europe.
We were fighting.
Greetings to Thomas.
