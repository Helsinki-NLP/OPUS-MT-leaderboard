Parliament does not support the amendment granting Tymoshenko's freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal an article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of a former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on the easing of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political place of the regime; in the West, the process has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or uprisings, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and without him the war is over.
It’s time to determine the winners.
As a rule, the Islamists are defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential infidels will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can’t imagine and that we’d hardly want.
However, our way of life is not the only one of its kind, nor the best and most likely not suitable, for example, for the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, the NATO raids were led not by the American general, but by Allah, the greatness of which they glorified after each blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "Crossosians".
Although without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold at virtually no cost?
They probably won't get it, and the West will finally be able to take advantage of civil rights.
Unless the Sharia followers put an end to this.
A new wave of crisis has begun.
France and the rest of Europe are now at the center of attention of investors.
A statistical storm struck over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published data on GDP in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
Yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%; France - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany did better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%). France reported a small decrease of 0.1% (the initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results turned out to be worse than analysts predicted.
The key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed a growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with forecasts of analysts.
Greece’s economy has shown a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The return on both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4%.
In Germany, they argue that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech national team has been selected in the Euros.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Iira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home match, and she will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
There is almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, in part due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Iira<0xC4><0x8D>ek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the exit to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovich and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>inich became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after they missed two great opportunities.
The magnificent Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
The game was very tense from the first minute.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of hosts in the first half. The far-off strikes on the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around Iran’s nuclear power plant.
Thus, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, a prayer for students before entering the building followed a prayer for the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
Thus, they demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything is evidence that Iran has not left any attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon for students’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, a prayer followed for the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran’s nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Eating children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner.
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior associated with a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate frozen potatoes for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, concerns the majority of families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year; it was attended by almost 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia.
The Obesity event is not a coincidence held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecn<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBD>edotn<0xC3><0xAD> poji<0xC5><0xA1>tovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports load are the main determining factors that cause a rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excess weight or from obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day on the breakfast-percussion-lunch-percussion-dinner scheme, which is one of the inevitable conditions of proper nutrition,” the study said.
No lunch and sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of a family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst finding is that in one in ten families, people don’t eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the correct daily diet.
The study showed that fried food is more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet chilled drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is more than double — up to 15% — when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In the second part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Preferences in food in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of spicy, meaty and sweet foods.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet chilled drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main meal of the meal, the paste defeated the bird with a small excess weight.
However, the children showed almost no interest in bean, fish and vegetable dishes.
Aspiration to a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the control group of the study showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after the conclusion of the Obesity lecture – it’s no coincidence,” says the results of the project.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet chilled drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children were more likely to notice birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baked goods.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about trainings for stylists, I sat on the volume of information at introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
Next is more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training is held every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is not a single man on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
With one short neck, with another boy figure with no proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the owners of a more lush chest and thigh and narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and waistband is so large that you can not pick up a skirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the invested funds, as the perfectly sitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt, sewn to order, you will feel much better than in the one that constantly moves, curls, exposes the waist, etc.
The owners of boys' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffles, appliques, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid, it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant of the courses had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm going to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know about the Victoria's Secret advertising campaign.
I’m happy about myself because it’s a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Kristina Aguilera, who has recently corrected herself to a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or quite young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
The mudboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic composition style.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Camenik told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
Stylists need common knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
A stylist, Honza Suborna; a fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and a fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist must use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a t-shirt can be worn in the usual way, on top of jeans and t-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without laces, like a dress.
Another option is to fold the sleeve or raise the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he said.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: “For your work, you should know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start to break them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we are going to brush up on all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist must have more options for outfits than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture the subject of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite differently than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Suborna confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it unnecessary (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like - secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about the fact that some celebrity ceiling/weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for the stylist to understand fashion and be able to choose clothes.
Our job consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to bully them and stick to their opinions.
“If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us that a work bag should be placed specifically.
This is the bag that you tie around the waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylers use it when shooting some items, for example, a bag or hat), special clips for fastening the fabric to the back of the shoe, if the buckle is worn
In order to get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to properly make linings on the soles of the shoes.
Even during filming in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention the shots on the street.
And here's what we did with the sticker.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors to avoid spoiling them.
This requires a real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not come to my mind.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m beginning to understand that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambitions to some extent were met, but that doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Run" connected great hopes.
It was expected to move previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions have indicated that the game will take a decent place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs away.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is marred by several unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in fact, this is not a mistake, but an inexplicable glitch of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of the story, whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
There’s no sense in the game that the same thing happens all the time.
Despite the fact that the schedule is on the same level as in the previous parts of the series, on some routes it is nice to watch.
The game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, racing from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, significantly reducing visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to get under the avalanche.
The individual races are quite well-ordered.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For some time you are trying to overtake several opponents (essentially a regular race); then you are trying to improve the time (the standard race with a second timer); or you are competing with one opponent.
In addition, from time to time you come across a police force that complicates your task even more.
The exterior of the car is new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of Jack’s time is running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it’s surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (just three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property doesn’t add up; given all the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows the tracks of previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you are looking for an imitation of real life, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far, it's all very good.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you do not expect complex transformations and collisions, but if you do not have the concepts before the collision with the object, how will your machine behave, something is wrong.
Usually, driving or driving past machines in a tight flow, you sometimes slightly touch the other machine. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation, your machine starts to spin furiously.
Or it broke into pieces.
This is not so important thanks to the reboot system, but it is enough to spoil the fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break down or leave the track far away, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful if something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race by accident.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go through a certain way, otherwise you just won’t sign up.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars in a specific location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, for five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily travel between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already arranged so that you either need to wrap them around or drop the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you get close to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
Competitors also have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent chases you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand before you no matter what.
The fact is that when it goes in front of you, it worsens your review, which leads to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it’s so obvious that it quickly starts to cause irritation.
Unfortunately, because despite the simple driving model, the game is fun and sometimes so packed with events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t let you miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to track the ignitions along the way, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sporters for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; these are individual sections races that you will learn during the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points, common to the modes of challenges and story.
Many options are available to get a higher level of driving: starting from the machines and ending with the profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another drawback that is difficult to understand; this is an example of the last race in a sequence.
You and your car will get into the subway tunnel (we’ll think so), where you’ll race along the tracks in the dark (we’ll think so).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h (we’ll assume that is so), when suddenly a subway train hits you from behind, turning your car into a bust of a metallolobra.
For a few days, our editorial team discussed whether no one really thought for a second while creating the game, or whether its creators really consider us such buffaloes.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although, unfortunately, at some critical moments, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true of events with a large number of participants, where a good recording would not help you too.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the lover.
In order to please as wide a youth as possible, the soundtrack has 'compositions of different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite messy.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Either way, the game leaves the feeling of infinity.
Of course, it’s a good entertainment, but be prepared for the drawbacks that will blind you as an airport projector.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation of disgruntled and skeptical towards the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable disagreements between individual organizations.”
“I didn’t expect that there would be such a brutal war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto “Clearly and openly about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the CU would be envious.
In addition, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse who can’t play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did with his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, communicate well with them and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative on international relations and security issues in response to the question "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vizenov went on to focus on the programme, which is key for the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success last year.
The Czechs dealt with the looming financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic’s representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing brawl at the moment.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support, and which will be smaller; all these issues will be in the upcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, the Understandable Language”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curvy or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more cheques to European organisations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future.
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note rather the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what about the assembly, the Visegrad group again?' and he doesn't like it.
In the future, the Union of Vicencios expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t want to remain sidelined.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompej in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those entering the Eurozone.
History of the brand:
The IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was established by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, senior.
He believed in his motto, according to which many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant revolved (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
What’s more, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, even though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the company’s current head on the anniversary occasion.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the question of employee care just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, an elegant uniform and a complex system of bonuses for bribes.
IBM’s long-term relationships with consumers are just as advanced.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming, in which many future innovations are emerging.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
Organization with a Good Reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
“From the very beginning, from the point of view of the concept, IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company,” Robert Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM, told the Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added Forrester Research consultant Joe Colony.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going into the market and creating it.
For a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company – developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services – from servers to nanotechnologies.
She holds the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, with five of her employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (first-ranked by Apple), beating Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look forward.
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundations on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it’s giving up on them.
This differs, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with twice as much capital, it was the strongest equipment-manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth $15 billion. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net earnings have steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate currency is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
The history of IBM: from a raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Company of Computing, Tabulation, Recording" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally it was called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They have mastered technologies such as the legendary "table clocks", i.e. the clocks that set the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a director of a rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the head of IBM responded to the founder’s shadow—Watson’s ideas remain the basis of unshakeable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of various equipment for business – from raw knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to nine million dollars, and the company’s large-scale expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly forty years later, his place in the chair of the director was occupied by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and services with high added value.
Over the past three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businesses control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class research group is also working on speech recognition.
Richtarzhova about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rihtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarch (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rikhtarzhova explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided Bartoshova's blood in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rjichan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In fact, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up, pretending that she had reconciled with her husband’s novel; and now she finally forgave him.
It doesn't matter who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richard and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife won't accept him with widespread embraces.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am connected," Rikhtarzhova said, adding that she had already freed herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual occasions.
As long as Joseph has nothing against the fact that his wife rejected him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our alliance still works; I’m in charge of repair, garden, house and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don’t share the bed anymore,” Rihtarzh told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarchov finds a new love, he will not interfere with it.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, who and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I have full responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
Worst Female Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you are constantly walking in the shops?
Do you need to buy at least one thing each week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will refuse to walk around the clothing stores in search of perfectly sitting clothes and try it (preferably, in different color options) in the sample?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you outside...
The Eternal Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
“I need to lose at least five kilograms – maybe I should start doing gymnastics?”
“Are you still attracted to me?”
Do you know these phrases?
- Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are interfered with in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching for yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to constant partner complaints about their appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Glass washer, dust washer, floor washer, dust washer, bath washer - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for coming on a clean cauldron in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room, which was so difficult to clean?
In the event that you suffer from this “distraction”, try to realize that falling into the extreme is not good; and that in your family order and purity should not stand in the first place.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationships, as well as the whole family.
Efforts to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Spletni
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each of us will probably break apart.
Let's be honest, that's apparently the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The successful transfer of Yagra and Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5:3 on the ice of Carolina. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Girard used the experience of a thirty-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player in the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to the player in the same team with Yagro Yakubu Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the match, Yagr told foreign journalists that he was predicting a wonderful evening for Zhir.
"I told him before the game that he was going to hit the hit-trick."
“I felt it.”
“Sometimes you feel things like that,” explained Jagr, after whose actions Zira scored at the first opportunity given by the Flyers.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech track".
The closing Harrikainz Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek took possession of the chessboard and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the rounds.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwayer narrowed the gap by a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second time again led the Flyers.
Especially the giraffe.
After the successful submission of the Yagra, he scored a third goal; his strike was later converted into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his center.
“I never thought at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.”
“That makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," he added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruuta and Dwyer's penalty, cutting the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our area."
"He hit the ship, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far end."
“I was aiming at it and I’m glad it worked,” Vorachek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Czech team of Montreal Yaroslav Spa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury to the upper body.
Along with an experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2–3 after the penalty series.
Tomas Plekanets could not shoot during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
“The situation is bad.”
“We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.”
“Whatever it is, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to make peace with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“The replacement was amazing, and we couldn’t resist.”
“We had to simplify the game, move the bar from our zone.”
"What was our weak side," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjej Pavelets helped Winnipegs beat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Dynamics of prices for travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at the time mostly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, on holiday Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was necessary; otherwise individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was either necessary to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency clearance was necessary for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency permission it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular present-day Croatia, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished, which marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not be satisfied with their travels to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krone. After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights performed by charter airlines. Compared to the past, airline flights have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. The great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent in twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country thus has forever joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15 thousand kroner per person during a holiday abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect the President, the threat of the duck is back
For about five months, Czech football did not have a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nuremberg on Tuesday.
There is still no consensus as to which election rules should be followed.
Without this, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrzhich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Paclik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gazek left his post in June. Leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era has once again brought football into the gap between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smihov, as negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
No agreement had been reached on who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials who had been authorized to vote.
This point has since been partly settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which a delegation based on the powers conferred is impossible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it mainly dealt with this issue.
Opinions on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the duck?
“The issue is whether to follow the established norms or find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received great support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree with the compromise - to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of the total number of voters in both houses.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the overall percentage ratio, the winner must collect at least two-thirds of the votes.
“However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers,” Svoboda agrees with Moravia’s arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomas Paczlik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates of the rules of the election determined by the statute, Peltos is more settled than other candidates.
“I would like the election to go as smoothly as possible.”
“I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense, as at the previous general meeting,” says owner Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he mostly contradicted Pelt.
Pelta is still an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that in the future the candidates will cooperate constructively.
“All emotional bracing will calm down after today’s expected national team exit in the European Championship.”
“Football will again be on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate,” says the representative of Jablonets. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
“I’m hoping for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
“It’s not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to intentionally adapt the rules.”
“This could lead to another general assembly breakdown.”
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, by Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of transfer.
In the end, a meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like the opposition parties in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot has been put on the map: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new Czech Sports Directorate after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclyk enters the presidential race because he does not see a suitable candidate
If before the extraordinary general meeting of the head of footballers Plzen Tomasz Paclyk would see a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high post.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself.”
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Paclik’s motive for joining the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrikh Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged election favorite, from joining the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
Moreover, Paclick stresses that in the event of a victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people that I could have in mind.”
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclik and Pelta is due to the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berber is a man of conflicting reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the whole.
Paclick thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward.”
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football," Paclick said.
He points to the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was recorded while listening to the phones while investigating the corruption case; Pelte managed to avoid sentencing.
“I don’t know what the prestige of Pelta’s victory would bring to football.”
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclick. He now does not mention his previous statement that he "will sell the club Plzen if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could present a partnership with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclick supported before the general assembly in September, which ended the fiasco.
He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn.
“He’s very capable.”
"I can introduce him to the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
"I also don't suck my nose at what I don't understand," said Paclick, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade headed by Ludeko Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclick says he'll risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has been managing the Plzen team, which with his help celebrated his first league triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better.”
“Restrict the influence of certain groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to disgusting situations,” said Paclik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Spartan director Daniel Krgetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key points that a new president should be addressing.”
"If the taxes are taxed gambling, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the club Plzen pregnant, although he claims that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec and Reichl with the Prague Doll.
“This is not the ideal option.”
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the club to someone else, since I'm going to be back there in six months," says Paclyk.
Pelta has promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid the Electoral Path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new rules of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to avoid disputes about the rules of the election in the future.
Prior to Thursday’s negotiations in Nimburg, an Applet official remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-election struggle will noticeably detract from today’s expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he would focus on both representation and the receipt of funds.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to support his ideas about football in a wider context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to head the association,” says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, rules that weren’t as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June.”
“If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I’m going to take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be unsuccessful.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says he is not trying to stand out against rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindrikh Reichl, whom he appreciates for his legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelto.
“He’s been in football for over a year and he’s had some success.”
“However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
“And that’s why some of them are now doubting his true identity,” Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims he is faithful to the statements he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team should represent the entire football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the bogeymen or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole of football,” a 40-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual employees." It was his message to Strakhova, where the prolonged period of interdependence causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not come to Nimburg empty-handed on Thursday.
“If the only controversial question is how to conduct elections in the third round, we can handle it.”
“Football needs the confidence it can gain only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start to work actively
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindrjih Reichl, the current vice president, will become president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will, on hearings, be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, there will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for specific areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the former president, Ivan Gashek.
“As president, I’d like to focus on football as a whole.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events," he said.
“I don’t mean to say that I will do everything myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
“I’m carefully distributing the tasks so that in each of these segments football has taken big steps forward.”
“It probably won’t be liked by many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement supposedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know if that makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks into my wheels and question my every step,” he explained.
“However, many people have told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come.”
“It’s a trust I can’t throw away,” he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to overstate it.”
“Processes have started that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association may return to what was before Hashek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent in.”
“He’s surrounded by people who would play football so that he’s only available to the chosen ones.”
“I can be blamed in many ways, but not in subjectivity.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“While a lot of people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the most for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plzen’s governing club, Tomasz Paclyk, entered the presidential fight, Reichl does not dare to appreciate his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his success, he refers to the savings of tens of millions of coins per hectare.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta has been "dismantled from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclicka, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashek has started, without significant personnel changes in committees.”
"He wouldn't start distorting the facts for his own benefit," Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water.
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try on the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
A book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not have done during her research trips for the last one and a half years: without her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and loved the carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-nuvo.
She was eager to add every favorite pool to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
The historian of architecture Meder has looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and now she has collected the impression in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming), where everything went, from the public pools in Munich to the historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and "Taunts in the Black Forest.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland.
The 46-year-old author is a real ball culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only downside is that the fans of swimming should be at peace with the blue tile and the smell of chlorine, while the runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful pools.”
When the surface doubles the architecture
Dancing in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna - a health factor in the baths is so significant, because, according to Meder, all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such a job. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a surface of water."
“The superiority is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything is reflected visually: high ceilings, colorful tiles and trampolines.
The illustrated 190-page edition of “The Joy of Swimming” contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the health oasis – and causes you to want to jump into the water.
A collector of water bodies, Meder, discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered water rich in nitrates in the karst cave (Pestenny in Miskolc-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water, in a building built in the form of a bottle (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lf<0xC3><0xBC>rd<0xC3><0xB6> in Jasberne), also a
From the many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see the whole Zurich from the bath on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Antony. It is allowed on the steamboat.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for swimmers in Langenfeld. Aqua council in Ectal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open shells emerge from it, which seem quite small against the background of the Ettal mountains.
Algambra in Schwartzwald
The pool collector Meder did not find the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray. Baths named Arpad in Bekeschabe smell so strongly of oil that it can be difficult for you to believe that you are in a health source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the algae, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at a certain point disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open swimming pool of the Czech baths in Lugachovice, she found that the territory was guarded.
The bathrooms, designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible types of windows of a red-and-white-yellow building in the style of ar-nouveau, she saw ants growing between the tiled chandeliers.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will find not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of Algambra, added around 1900.
After careful reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder swimming pool - is not only because it is of Schwarzwald origin.
"It's a real achievement - so masterfully combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
To dive into the thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Speculation of Agricultural Products (Agricultural Products)
Doiche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will the Doiche Bank stop trading agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the task to the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the underprivileged around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis from the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Garald Schumann, demonstrates that the game of betting on world commodity exchanges raises prices – and so banks are involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
Initially, betting on goods was conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have given up on the rules of supply and demand – and are being used at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism. He promised to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade "is not worth risking the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
The trade in goods may decrease or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
The President of Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, emphasizing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Effects on rising food prices - a crying example of how mindless banks are currently acting against common interests".
As the bank’s chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“The Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Akkermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not go to the supervisory board as planned.
The cancellation of the speculative dispute in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not need to worry about expenses - with the consequences he will have to deal with his successor.
Each of them would refuse to invest in the product.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people took part.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that make a bet on the price of food are acceptable for the Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, every second would withdraw contributions that ultimately lead to speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings. The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won awards, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and was abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold ones that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwantzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its light steaming structure made of steel and glass.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
After all, it was famous all over the world in 1973 for its legendary BMW four-cylinder tower and its sister – a glass-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as a 20th-century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been vacant since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
The architect Adolph Krishanitz has since restored the pavilion, which has been called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belvedere Museum’s department, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening – in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslyin-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a young figure skater, who worked at Sotheby's, the Museum of Guggenheim and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, will be used as a reincarnation and a reincarnation
The new museum was to house a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruby Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. Also an office building had to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, thanks to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session by Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology of Vienna, and the pavilion was for him an "extremely important place" where he attended the exhibition "needle kachti".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost part of its size and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last reconstruction were much more serious. The building was "a absorber of energy", says Krishantits.
Window profiles on the glass facade have been replaced, reinforced fiberglass safety glass has been installed, and the glass roof has been replaced by high-strength safety glass.
Steel translations of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still a fine Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old red-brown color to protect against corrosion.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this is under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum management,” says Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite limitations, problems and transformations.
Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz recently noted that the pavilion “from Brussels” was rough – a typical history of “drops in the city”.
Such an architecture "is not always in its place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, because during the planning of the city there was an unexpected luck. Completely reconstructed "quarter of the main station" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of the Krishnanitsa - collector Francesco von Habsburg acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and is reportedly in talks with the city about the location of its neighbor.
Deutsche Bahn plans multimillion winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn’s internal crisis plan, the Bild newspaper reports that a total investment of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million is planned by 2015.
The investments are designed to increase the efficiency of locomotives and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow removal from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before starting work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, the head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellation and delays of trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at a time of worsening weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with the launch of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axis of the ICE trains much more often over the years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to Pay Many Millions of Pounds of Fine in the U.S.
The new troubles came after the unrest around Joseph Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatening a fine in the US for many millions of pounds.
Literally, Deutsche Bank had little problems at home, the past of the industrial giant in the US has now bullied him. Deutsche Bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to calm the financial disputes that arose after the bank's time.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA), a regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged credit unions down.
“We are pleased that we solved this problem without referring the parties to the court,” said a spokeswoman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and interferes with bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses that flow out of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer triggered a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgages.
They are supported by internal loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 a bubble in the U.S. real estate market broke out.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live a long time in September 2008 on the brink of a financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Agency for the Financing of Housing Construction (FHFA) is behind the biggest wave of claims.
It accuses 18 of the largest international banks of having acquired bailouts of approximately $200 billion from U.S. credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank is also facing a threat of prosecution by the FHFA on numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion, concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a Frankfurt-based bank to take responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares totaling more than ten billion dollars.
Warren Buffett, America’s largest investor, has always said he doesn’t invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed its opinion on investments in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investments were considered a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now been given the title "IBM Sir".
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March, he has acquired IBM shares worth a total of 10.7 billion dollars.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest holders of IBM shares with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
IBM’s significant time has been focused on high-income IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has evaded technology companies.
He claimed that he only invests in those companies that he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in the construction of machinery.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most expensive companies in the world with the help of skilled investments.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost flawless money-making instinct earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
The price of IBM shares increased by one percent before markets opened after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, also known as IBM, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the “cheek in Zwickau”, the Turkish media began to doubt the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers talks about a “bloody ideology” that is now rising to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and anxiety have become a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears. There have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Milan in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the now-discovered right-wing extremist network has such a scale that it is not yet fully aware.
The “Resurrection of Blood Ideology?” was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may find themselves drawn into the right-wing extremist boycott.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, recalling the victims of racial hatred by a silent picketing against the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at the ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the hiring of workers.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Enlightenment in some Turkish media was like a bribe. "Gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet also did not miss the occasion to hold this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lakhji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The behavior of the police and the subsequent successful cloud have been sharply criticized in German-Turkish online forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought about monitoring the suspects in the right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act equally carelessly, there will be no other choice for migrants than armed self-defense."
"This will be the best self-defense."
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the entire network will be opened and on the legality of the punishment,” Selen wrote.
The crimes in Mellon and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the fact that the world in Germany was under threat.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks so clearly living here that they are in danger, and the Germans - that mistrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the feeling of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past.
The Turkish press at the time mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Melna.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was accepted by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
as if he had determined the value of a person by the taxes that he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
He made clear what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bankruptcy scandal in Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s leading risk-based banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has hardly bankrupted during the financial crisis and since then has been constantly struggling with one crisis, another crisis.
Now to return it to the correct course must the German.
Alex Weber probably didn't think he'd get the part.
In July, after his effective retirement from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work on a no less effective post – Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was obviously delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its re-found strength and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has changed for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grubel – a banker known not only in Switzerland – had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take up his post?
Weber has been consulting the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take over as chairman of the board already in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he long deserved the title of “largest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world, and on the other hand - has not emerged from scandals in years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is not saving anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time a greedy asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, he joined the league of the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, a long-time professor at Zurich University’s Institute of Banking, explains: “I’ve always brought my UBS students as a model of a good bank.”
“Knowing what we know now, you can ask how I could have been so wrong.”
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wuffley - who was considered an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker - unexpectedly left his post.
A few months later we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write billions.
Believe it or not, but UBS has reported a 13 billion Swiss franc increase in capital to counter the crisis.
The bank was indeed able to find investors – but investors, from whom many bankers would have politely refused recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden so much that even its name was not disclosed.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel – the second-high-paying Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006 – resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was faced with a threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased from UBS toxic securities for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the huge banks being founded in a small country.
After all, UBS’s final balance sheet in 2007 was five times higher than all of Switzerland’s production (see chart).
“We will not be able to save UBS a second time,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was willing to pass on the data of wealthy clients who may have been tax-deductible with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted business income plus fines.
UBS, therefore, more or less acknowledged that it was a tax avoidance tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich customers – the veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client’s money began to flow.
For several months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its activity - in investing due to unsuccessful speculation and in asset management as a result of aid and encouragement of tax avoidance.
And it just calmed down and it seemed that UBS managed to break the situation, as this disaster happened with the afferent trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed in the bank that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment department is not working yet.
“The incident with Adolphus clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at Zurich University.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk-control tool.”
For a long time, caution has made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol of indelible reliability, as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli symbolize the exquisite taste of chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only it is a little more.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on Banhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rates of rent for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli stores you can find jewelry firms such as Tiffany's here.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Ber.
A heavy door leads to the lobby of UBS.
There are large leather sofas along the marble-covered walls. Next to the emblem of the bank, a large indicator "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking — or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the paper – like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large – in particular, in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits - and then fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” wrote Lucas Hessig in his book The UBS Crash.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If asked by Swiss banks, they would say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too large for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but graduated bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to the large amount of money they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffly, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wolffly and Ospel are a dream team,” says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wulfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding model and statistician, and Aspel with his inner instincts, has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of board members, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to beat Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the "tournament table", where the success of the banks was brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this path.
UBS was the largest player in currency trading and government securities.
Authorized consultants on management issues, however, pointed to a weak spot. According to that parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS engaged in an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in American substandard securities.
It developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them further — continuing to carry risks on its own.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as the attempts to bring the bank in order turned out to be more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a children’s game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
In front of anyone who heads this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger’s banking analyst already has an idea – to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities need to be significantly deterred.
The new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
In fact, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was only seen as a temporary decision when the bank suddenly parted ways with his predecessor, Grubel.
Over the past time, he has managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It reduces the number of jobs by 3,500.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
In public, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Threats of recession in Europe drag down U.S. stock exchange
The looming recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes that the debt crisis could be overcome in the womb.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens did not receive reinforcements.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty — but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 percent.
The market barometer during the trade varied between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent, trading 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing by 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The statistical service Eurostat reported that in September the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
“We’re not on the island, we’re dependent on them,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to hit a recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns. In an interview with CNBC, he said that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw into the trash bin a ten-year-old principle and invested in the U.S. high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM in excess of ten billion dollars raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at a level of $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of the remaining shares of the Construction Bank of China, having earned $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital ratio of net profit from sales in order to comply with stricter regulations.
The aircraft manufacturer Boing won, cutting losses on the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose by 1.5 percent after the company received the largest order in its history.

Imaginary thieves fill the cities
Players are considered problem birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of the cities.
Some like birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise, in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been reached.
At the first symposium, dedicated to crows, in the city of Lehr in East Frisia, experts argued that it is no longer possible to expel peacocks from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected peat, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional areas of residence.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees for nesting have made life more difficult for birds.
The guards are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwestern part of Yevere, Dipholce, Ahime near Bremen and Lere there are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of parents.
A vague project of the shooting of thieves in Lera caused disapproval of newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described hunting birds in traps and stabbing them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
“Normal movement and deterrence don’t give a damn,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lera.
Cutting down a stream of water or a bunch of trees often has adverse consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, said.
“Animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
Terrification is possible only in the form of an exception next to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We will have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang K<0xC3><0xB6>lner.
The combination of bird scares from those in need of protection of residential areas and their incentive to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information booths instead of benzophiles" - was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational hellish route in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands give information about the life of very thoughtful gamblers.
The project has already attracted interest from tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about noise produced by birds. "The noise conveys a lot of information. They need to tell each other a lot".
The mind and smile of these birds have entered the legends. Players often not only use the tools to master the viewed piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of a bird’s mind on four peacocks.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to bump into the litter in order to extract the mollusk.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the daughter.
In another experiment, the intelligent rats had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers put a small weeder with a mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the bait to the hook.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds took advantage of the wire to make hooks and used hooks to clamp the bucket over the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have been able to do so since the first attempt.
Ronaldo to take Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for victory at the last minute were not long-lasting.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.

Cheham was enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round play-off against Montenegro's outsider after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.

The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the lower end of the bar, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Yirachek beats for Czech Republic
Then in the center of attention was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postig at the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing by hand after Fabio Quentran's foul - Misimovich implemented it.
After the break of the 2004 European Vice-Champions, the account was secured by four more goals.
Peter Yirazek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are set to go to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.

The goalkeeper Petro Chek in the 9th minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential car driver Tomash Sivok.
Montenegro’s best chances were when on the field there was a duo of Stevan Jovetich and Deyan Damyanovich.
Damyanovich hit from the end of the penalty area for the 40th minute and barely scored a Czech goal.
After the break, she saved the already beaten Czech world-class goalkeeper after the forward FC Seoul left the field for the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, did not have enough football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn’t play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt now that coach Gus Hiddink will now be able to free up a place on the squad, which reached third place in 2002, the Croatians are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in the eyes of 31,000 spectators at the stadium Maximir.
Seljuk Inana's long-range strike for the seventh minute came into the standings, and the attacking Kazim Kazim was unable to throw the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croatian continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field together with Mario Mandzukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave place to Ivan Perishich of Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni will go to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first European exit after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team – who already looked confident in their place after a 4-0 win in the first leg – took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward’s goal.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team compared the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland has been at a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute did Robbie Kin of Los Angeles make his first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed not to let him take Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
By bypassing goalkeeper Paul London, Ward was in the right place and by dropping the ball across the line, he changed the score to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The company, which is part of the Dax listing, said on Thursday that it plans to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people,” Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s executive directors, said in a statement at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The population of 2,500 is expected to grow to 4,500.
The global market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this country, experiencing an economic boom, there are about 4,000 SAP customers from more than 176,000 around the world.
China’s growth forecast is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is included in the Dax listing.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the company from Valdorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The business software provider, with 55,000 employees around the world, looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on informatization in China.”
Mass Killings - The Human Dimension
Peter Englund’s very exciting and good new book, Beauty and Grief: A Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of active individuals from whom the heart is at peace.
Here’s a tip on how to read further: carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as you tell Mr. Englewood, and this list of active people will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you will get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, cunning journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat techniques.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains, how much "a book about what it looked like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and state of mind."
The book “Beauty and Grief” brought together the experience of 20 years of more or less unremarkable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets caught, loses a hand or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives here are marked as church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some at this time are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a severe cover-up war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Grief" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee owls; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is flies cece.
This is an interesting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling smokeless dust.
When a canon is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay in place or escape?
One way or another, who's going?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why we need to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows the fate of people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other already published materials.
Stories about their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund's collected little moments and insightful details.
Many of them are about arrests and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of the German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, everywhere erzaz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, non-real resin, paper ties, wooden cuffs."
He continues to talk about erzaz-food in Germany.
He describes "meat from pressed rice, boiled in a barrel of fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes stuffed with wood".
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell about honor and courage.
One American observes in himself the tendency to cruelty and says of war: "You do not feel that, in the end, it is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller, and to say that you are a jerk and that you are a jerk.
The British soldier, on the other hand, notes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be sad.
“When a person humbles himself with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But this, on the contrary, is terribly similar to the “convicted man, whom they secretly hang.”
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new kinds of fear.
“The conflict has become more and more an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls “a new look in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-dressed suit that arranges a cut, sitting at a desk.”
People act in an unpredictable way: low-level actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who were trying to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front lines.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
“The very desperate ones have rubbed it in the eyes, which often leads to lifelong blindness.”
Translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but unobtrusive, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war “freed out completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as "On the Western Front without Change" by Erich-Marie Remarck, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this non-chalant pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not going to tell him.
But it’s as if he reached out from the book to a page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands and set it on fire.
After the previous error - a carefully calculated reid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there was to be the least number of people in Zukotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone, except a few high-ranking officers, the rest were first told that they were leaving for training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence underscored how much importance the police department attached to the operations.
There could be no talk of repeating such episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of tear gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to release protesters from Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing to observe how the occupations in other cities were unfolding.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randalls, with Zucotta in mind.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called drills in the event of riots - counter-terrorism measures, which involve the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - in the sense of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was only referred to as "training".
“The few cops I know and who were called to the case didn’t say they were being sent to Zukotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that conquered the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters, who sneered inside before the deadline, after hearing about these plans.
The operation was carried out on Tuesday by officers from various police units, including district forces, a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal areas of the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a suitable time to attack.
“It was right to do this when there is the least of the people in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with projectors and loudspeakers gathered at the Peak-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The projectors and the pre-recorded announcements carried by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
Police said the tents did not touch until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to collect things.
Other groups of police officers, according to witnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police acted, and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through a pile of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets, and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department's teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown away.
Some of the protesters, who refused to leave, pulled out, photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp shook hands together.
And two people tied themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut the locks, rescue workers were called in.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for “a violation of public order and resistance in detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the search police department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "did not lead the operation," said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
Fences were placed on Cortland Street, in the neighborhood to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the neighborhood to the south.
Observers saw how from these positions the police extended the perimeter even beyond the boundaries of Zukotti Park.
At one point, the observers saw how a group of police officers, many with shields, pushed people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, and others, according to witnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The Union of Serviced School Personnel will bring the city to court for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to go to court in the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and were discriminatory due to the disproportionate impact on schools where poor scholars are studying.
The trial is probably the last resort available to a 37-member union of the district council trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for working with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7 as a result of what the leaders of the trade union called a medical response to their
City officials have categorically rejected this accusation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members parried, telling him that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that the school support staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37 district council reported that they had filed a claim notification, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The plaintiffs will be identified as Mr. Wolcott and the City's Department of Education, and eight temporary laid-off workers will be listed as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint, which was put at the disposal of the New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poorer areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that the poorer schools were not overcrowded.
He points out that while there were no redundancies in Staten Island, and there were few in the schools of the Upper East Side or Tribeca, 17 school assistants lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in District 9 and District 8.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked in free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget failures.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could have been misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of the coordinators for work with the parents.
The notice used the word "exceeding", although "exceeding" is more often spoken of when a teacher from the school's payment statement moves to the list of existing employees, the salaries paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired,” the lawsuit said, “and not just translated.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something that has something to do with the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution tabled by U.S. President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent), who was "independent",
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic aspirations from both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has yet been held easily.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the US military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of the votes of both parties and never got a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the American operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative clean-up — when Congress was angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry that it really kicked the ground out of her feet.
Then the events overcame the indecision of Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
NATO’s mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the non-violent operation for their protection.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council, or will they split legislators, such as the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader in the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the House Capitol this week, the House of Representatives is due to vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else that will be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convocation.
Other lawmakers have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they have not tried.
Gudlat's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised in this convocation.
Some of them were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a little more on "control over federal spending".
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors – mostly freshly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “moved” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, called for both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote to amend the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to cancel the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as well as another one prohibiting the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose them.
No matter how many members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th, 66.
This pace is striking compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they have achieved no more success than they do now.
The last amendment that was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
“Be beaten, but not defeated,” Giffords says in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the gunman shot at her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) on Monday night appeared on the federal channel, chanted a chorus of "concern from the ship", and sang a chorus of "concern from the ship".
Appearing on the "20/20" ABC News program with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from a bullet wound that shattered the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, going from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the draft limit debt bill.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
Asked how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour special issue "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of the new wife's book "The Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special issue told about the recovery of Giffords after the January 8 shooting.
In the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Swipe your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word: "What."
A few days later, Giffords pronounced the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by the BBC shows that music played a central role in Giffords’ recovery: we see a congressman singing along with the doctors “Girls just want to have fun” Cindy Loper and “Free Fall” Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she does not remember the day of the trial.
Her husband said he read a Giffords article in the newspaper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected assailant Jared Lee Lafner is held in a Missouri prison and undergoes forced treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, 'Gabbie, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through this, you'll heal and come back stronger than ever.
The military feels more regret than respect.
The event was a celebration on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines built around it.
The smoker's audience applauded him.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was regret.
Quite the opposite impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has been established between the army and often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
The soldiers are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, the military says.
The public is behaving more and more as if they are feeling sorry for people in shape.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as if we were unhappy.”
This is a sensitive topic for warlords who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger that the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they roared at the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will think whether “under the mask there is a cruel evil veteran,” said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, on his return, held a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some of the interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshn recalls how he told his sons: “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The discomfort experienced by the military partly stems from the American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely earned praise from a country that is little known to the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism the way it was quite usual in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Bernou, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of trips they made, the number of comrades they lost, or the extent of the loss.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, at historic court hearings, it should be decided whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army on charges of non-violence.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be established in line with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, according to her claim, was raped at night by her co-worker.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a fellow man carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” says Leyman.
But the native of Texas expressed her concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
“I’m sorry I didn’t listen to my instincts.”
A few minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, fell down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Leyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will be eagerly awaiting the court’s decision at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether to prosecute a lawsuit they have filed against the ex-Rosher Minster.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
The lawsuit filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., did not initially involve 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they have been raped or threatened not to commit sexual violence, and that the parties should not be prosecuted.
Burke says she aimed at senior army officials because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence? Higher leadership."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 other victims have been linked to her, many of whom may take part in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case – putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak – she will open a lot of cases if necessary to maintain the pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy – mostly consisting of the fact that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damages suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by the Ferres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage refers to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially banned from participating in the battle, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the combat zone.
The result: in the period between the two wars, 150 female soldiers died - two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the army to become modern, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her suit, three others are prepared.
At the Yale School of Law, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on the charge of promoting the genitourinary atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the army, at the center of which the diagnosis of "personality changes" that are the victims of violence to remove them from service is a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Akhova.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Office of Veterans Affairs, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of people claiming to be at risk of sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported, according to the Ministry of Trafficking Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service.
But, as we know, the attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought to court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The Turks in the Berk case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Leyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times the fiancée of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the assailant - from the cut to the hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Leyman sat in front of the judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Leyman.
"I thought I was born now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a mental ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander said, 'It wasn't a trial for him. It was a trial for me.'"
Lyman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavorable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Leyman and her co-workers on the lawsuit will move forward is a complex issue, says John Terley, a law professor at George Washington University’s law school.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine, which has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been critical of the Feres Doctrine my whole life.
The army has been behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds: “The chances are very much against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what's going to happen sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy exposing his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who became aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing.
While Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting to them is not difficult,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism at the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use an advertising tool on the site to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy – what marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then pushed them into advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey in which there were questions about the level of their education, their attitude to usability, and their attitude to usability.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to poll more than 10,000 participants from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way to conduct research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not so striking: online right-wingers are most often young men of the male sex, dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world – from health issues to social trends that are expressed in ‘Lakes’, posts on the wall, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-updated information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site by 800 percent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it gives an opportunity to study people who can’t be approached on the street with a blockchain.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to join the party, and they’d never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site, it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as their in-house tutors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
“You can’t solve the problem without revealing it,” said Washington Post’s Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We’ve found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn’t otherwise have found.”
Facebook is also constantly extracting different kinds of data about its users.
The data processing group of the site has processed statistics of the relationship status and St. Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in the middle of the term in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that the site has access to only them), that the champions of cyber freedom have to do for a long time.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users at all thought that the researcher could observe their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about the study he conducted in 2006 using publicly available student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they thought, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
It is not possible to find out on Facebook how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite years of work in the field of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools out of those that can be used.
“Nobody can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Breivik to appear in court for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who became aware of the organization of a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during the first public appearance in a court in Oslo.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge actions, but I do not acknowledge guilt."
Judge Torquel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a pre-written speech, to appeal to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, while others have come to make sure that he is locked up.
Everyone came to find the answers to their questions.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors on Utay told Norwegian channel NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but personally it got a little easier for me after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue collar, Breivik maintained calmness and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation is feeling right now.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” a relative of one of the victims said.
“It would be a lot easier if it were so.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shows at the Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Invention of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans may consider the biggest discovery in a recently rediscovered interview, which was remembered in anticipation of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also an up-to-date organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from “disease to think that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... and a great product of the great idea.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a Triumph of Nerves TV series about the emergence of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique extended talk.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he had already been working at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of mass Internet development.
While a small portion of Kringley's interview was used in Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited material became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which airs at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of a detailed interview, Jobs seems unusually willing to explain his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And unbelievably thoughtful.
At four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley’s questions, making him move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In a pre-Pixar, ipods and iPhones interview, there is something worse prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about Jobs’ postmortem evaluations, but there’s something hurtful and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an anxious dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“During all this time in business, I’ve been constantly asking, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answers you’re constantly getting are, ‘Oh, it’s just done that way.’
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize reporting at Apple.
Disturbed by the way of recording expenses, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted by means of “accuracy”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to track business expenses up to the smallest.
A joke about the Pope:
Jobs tells in detail about the "blue box" he mastered with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively break into the phone company and call large distances for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of granting power is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the globe half a dozen times, and you shouted at the phone machine, and it broke into the neighboring phone machine a minute later,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young, and all we’ve learned is that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both knew a little bit, but we could master a little thing that could control a big thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think that without it, Apple could ever have appeared.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one of the famous getaways he and Wozniak have practically managed to cope with by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope’s phone to try to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two were outraged by laughter just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and Bill Hullett's cold calling):
At the age of 12, looking for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hulett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at the Hulett Pacard.
“It has had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what the company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic-beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager and spin around that car and write a program for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products in the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting boards, one buyer asked him to collect an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on the loan, he had to think about both assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered while developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the fierce arguments ... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to gather a mouse that would cost $300] and I was full of throats and went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large companies that lose energy:
Long before he headed Apple’s revival, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would go wrong in seeing the situation and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and people who make a product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is pushed out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be a 90's Microsoft...
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a Form of Art:
“A great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skilled labor... when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to go to – some things you won’t be able to force to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 ideas – these concepts – by connecting them all together...
In the end, it all comes down to taste – it all comes down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it into what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists are copying, great artists are stealing.
It has always been a shame to steal great ideas.
Part of what made McIntosh famous was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to become the best experts in the field of information technology in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court is considering the case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether he would listen to the repeal of President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were celebrating a luncheon sponsored by an osprey firm.
The case happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition’s submissions.
One of the issues on the agenda was an application backed by 26 states challenging a speedy health review passed by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour rotational debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an impediment to the presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the court decision is announced.
A lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the Health Care Act should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently upholds conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The dinner was held at the Washington hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
Honorary guests for lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: the two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were obedient, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Court.
“The judges drank and dined at an official fundraising event with lawyers, whose cases are now being considered in court.”
Their emergence and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say they are very fond of mixing court cases with groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Jenny, is a famous conservative activist.
What’s more, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue for Judges Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court level of the first instalment.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record-breaking order of $18 billion for aircraft
Emirates has ordered 50 wide-body Boeing 777s, and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal size of more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price tag for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold man who lived future orders for airplanes.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft – 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s.
An incredible order was received from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at Dubai Airport in 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which can boast a significantly better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The price tag for six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neil Dior said.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many of the Middle East’s airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for planes, but also the rise in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, not so destructive because the country makes money at high low prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of the aircraft as prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the market for wide-haul aircraft and helps to prevent attempts by rival Airbus SAS to gain control with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the airline came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the sensory load after buyers demanded to increase the load capacity and range of the flight.
Shares of Boeing Co increased 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico’s president’s sister apparently lost in the election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the pre-election race.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have failed to make her bid for Governor Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s seat during a fierce state election, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped to propel the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the seat of the governor of the western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview the following day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections... they took the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valejo seems to have only slightly surpassed Calderon, who headed the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now owns the governor’s seat, came in third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug dealers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michoacan, drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine have long dominated.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues to this day.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he campaigned for Luis Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michoacan look, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valejo and said: "I think this victory should be very exciting ahead of next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ABR office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with either the help of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries are looking at Europe's difficulties "unbiased", and said Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
“This concerns all of us.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can’t be inviolable.”
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowings have increased dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could once again lead the world economy to a recession, and has led to calls from leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. One predicted that any Asian assistance would be conducted through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of EU financial assistance fund bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe, provided a tremendous strength to the Asian partners in the negotiations.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have a great job and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a mandatory condition because where we’re going to find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that for a developing economy like India, there is no point in helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for 1.2 billion Indian people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will learn that the Greeks are retiring at 50 years old and going on holidays to the sea, and it will not be perceived well,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India’s reserves should be used to hold Greek large and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as iron ore.
Mr. One said the eurozone crisis is threatening “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “lower risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to draw up “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon's Fearful Warnings of Potential Defensive Cost Reductions
Defense Minister Leon Panetta has weathered the situation in Congress on Monday, warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the e-mail.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the next decade, but is now afraid that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester initiated a general reduction of 23 percent and the termination of many new projects.
“Such a strong reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfulfilled — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building — and will seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also have to fire many of our staff members, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the staff to achieve the goals.”
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to combat readiness."
The cuts will eventually affect the military parts, Panetta said.
“Although military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements are seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets,” Panetta warned.
"The contract staff will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of the contracts and the supervisory contract that supports the troops."
“The staff will be reduced, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
The two senators wrote to the panel 10 days ago, asking for details of possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defense.
"As a result of the sequestration in the Department of Defense, the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power will be."
“We are firmly opposed to these dragon actions,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they published Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not an outlet that we can live with, and it’s not an outlet that we have to impose on ourselves.”
“Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or senators’ recent warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon’s release from cuts, we will see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work under the leadership of the Pentagon after years of budgetary scrutiny in Congress and the White House and realizing that he was faced with a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense drew a false picture of what could follow: an army with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a team without bullets."
"It's a wing of an airplane without enough prepared pilots."
“This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in his introductory remarks in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness, and unable to fight against potential enemies.”
“In essence, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McKay and Graham, Panetta risked new details of how the cuts "create significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restrict our ability to be first in the fold and to be in the fold.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face hurdles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter jet, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground-based combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace.
Cessation of further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A fleeting look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Caine, is engaged in contesting allegations of sexual harassment against several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania has been charged with falsification, as they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested last week when he told US President Barack Obama on the microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying is ruining careers and scaring countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibtionist Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by indisputable evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, has been charged with financial machinations during a campaign related to the cover-up of extramarital affairs.
And again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget a media circus with President Bill Clinton, rigged in a lie about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
History of cheating on exams at school and college is a common thing.
There have been instances when teachers gave students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities themselves.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In a single day, research shows, you can lie 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Identifying a lie or lying is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, similar to, say, ballads, where it is necessary to shout "Fallen!", the detection of lies is a serious direction of knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in prestigious design universities, researchers, and researchers,
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars are looking into the eyes.
They don’t always turn on, turn on, red or fade.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that the liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced lie detector can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, mimicry, question structure, and temporal characteristics.
I've spent a few years researching scientific discoveries in the vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it's clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps to focus on our complex world -- a condescension, especially if your professions
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel unobtrusive, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts cheat more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women -- about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people cheat less on their partners than they cheat on their unmarried (but that lie they say more often).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty about cheating on you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the “definition of the original state.”
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing further changes.
Observe the posture, laughter, vocal characteristics of your object.
It is good for you to know if a person is constantly bumping his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see a bumping his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of fraud.
Fraudsters can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean toward the exit, change their position in a certain way, or demonstrate "slightness after the interview" - this exaggerated sigh of relief and change.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interview signal to simply look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson has resigned and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which has led to her quest across the country.
Violent people may also use distance speech: “I didn’t have sex with this woman ... Miss Levinski” or repeat the complicated question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchy.
Someone can use a "qualifying language" when answering a complicated question: "Well ... to tell the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know".
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic way to detect a lie, but it is possible to master the ability to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled jugglers in professional and personal life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline needs to be revised after the US threat to delay its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- provoking the anger of the unions, but calming down environmentalists -- a company that is going to rebuild, is going to rebuild, is going to rebuild.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still receive approval.
The company voiced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Purbass says the company remains confident that it will eventually receive approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department’s statement last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sand Hills of Nebraska and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground reservoir.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental review, commissioned by the State Department, is likely to delay decision-making until 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline should stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is expected to move 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the oil refineries in Texas.
In order to do this, it needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he loves unions who hope for about 20,000 jobs related to oil pipelines.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are considering a bill to speed up the move from the Sand Hills and Ogallala aquifer area, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current study by the State Department on the impact on the environment has shown that the project will have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the reviewer of the Department ordered a separate examination.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another is whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate as it was related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBell was sued for allegedly causing a child to panic.
The New York family claims that the disco giant Patty LaBell began to storm into the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their teenage daughter to such an extent that it was horrified.
“Lady Marmalade’s tirade terrorized 18-month-old Geneva Monk so badly that she endured “a change in personality, a sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers,” her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10 last year, when the working scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevyev were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage carrying Genevyev.
Rozanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell angrily made a statement to a pregnant woman.
“She aggressively said, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter near the door,’” said Rosenna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She became angry and began to use the deceit -- the word on C and the word on F -- on the raised tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said that the hysteria had begun in Geneva.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBell leaned on her mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby was crying so much that she was strangled, she added.
The family later sent LaBell an apology note, but received no response.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it will receive, to the charity of children, to cancer patients.
“The goal is to make Patty LaBell responsible for his actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 - the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as associated with the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth of the economic base, but there was still a gap.
The low temperatures of February not only led to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the possibility of growth of the state economy, causing a reduction in economic activity by a total of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historical fall of 31.16 percent.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost provided by the Council of Mexico for the sustainable development of the rural area, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected as a whole, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected by frost.
the decline in economic activity caused, until November, the steady growth of unemployment in the state, the percentage of unemployment in the previous year, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters was recorded an accelerated increase in the level of unemployment, from January to March, the rate of unemployment in the previous year, was 55.053, the population of Sinaloa was unemployed
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is addressed by many factors, for economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Servantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions undertaken in the state.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law, which has been passed in Congress to fight money laundering, as it is illegal to tell people who are in possession of it.
Suspended immigration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Servantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad has been limited in the U.S., primarily because of difficulties with entry, and secondly because, once entering, they are already faced with a lot of difficulties in finding work, so the group of people is unemployed.
Violation of formal requirements
Analysis of Sinaloa’s labour market is getting worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malpractice, another reminder of work in the state is provided by low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, much lower than the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of PII
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the State FDI amounted to $630,697.
For its part, the State Government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded just 17,280,000 pesos of investment over the year, which mainly came to companies in the service sector.
Dolg
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government asked in July during the state congress for the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level, no more than 2,600 pesos were approved.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrates the lack of opportunities of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Processing Industry, said that during 2011 there was not enough coordination of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, a lot of work has to be done to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to reconcile the efforts of everyone and, above all, we will be doing a good and synchronized job of the new government.
Slowing down the economy
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Loredo said that events such as the early frosts stopped the state’s economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and, therefore, we do not have a year-on-year
Revision of directions
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we found that we worked on it, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
The Future of Work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the government's efforts.
"Overall, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own way in the conduct of public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that much more needs to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine in the amount of income for 100 days - such a sentence was imposed on the citizen of Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General’s Office said the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of a crime against health, in this case storing marijuana for the purpose of spreading.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol of the street of Cypriano Valdes, before post No. 80 in the city of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the wheel of a white car pickup, in which he carried a black bag in the box in the car, and in the passenger seat - a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the extract was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to remain incarcerated in the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions must be made to the work
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are likely to remain unfinished or long overdue due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while work programmes have so far developed, they are in danger, as the State Government is unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for work, and so it is still possible to delay their completion.
“They had to invest almost 12 million, and although the year ended, they didn’t give us a penny when they had to give us a share from the beginning of July,” he said, “so as not to delay, we started work and they have made a lot of progress, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Hesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the term of the municipal government had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not granted in the case.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to gain access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what remains to be the state,” he explained.
Although the State authorities had an obligation to provide these resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest on them came as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even if the year ends, they didn’t give us any money.”
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has made in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which carries the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes needed to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree detailing the move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olgoi S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in the law under the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical jurisprudence and law.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the state administration.
“I also don’t think that if that happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he said, noting that the planning of state policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector has to do with the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals – one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the postponement of benefits from the transformation into a digital form, which includes the satisfaction of public needs, which has not only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic governance, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of small technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting a decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data provided in the PPRV, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, amounting to 879 out of the total number of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is real, as regards the election process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where, according to the data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PPPV), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is only 27 percent.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Election Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles L<0xC3><0xAD>nderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral corps approved a set of principles to align local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not accept the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process, and the Governor Leonel Goda Rangel did not include the law in his public notice.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (the Supreme Court) passed a decision on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature, and called the "invalid and illegal" vote of the representative of the state on constitutional reform.
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote-by-vote” Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IVM it would be possible to submit a partial or full counting of votes to the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot ballots may be made under conditions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting protocol and counting documents in the ballot box or it is not with the president; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the general counting of votes in all ballots in the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the candidate-winner being considered and those who received second place in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that the
A general recount of votes will also be made if at the end of the usual count it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate will have taken the second place, if the candidate has taken the second place.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morellia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
Its dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, a reassuring ceremony was held.
According to the family, the last will of the colonel was to have his dust scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the Basio Cortesa family returned to the capital of Coaquila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marte.

At 5:30 p.m., he passed the certification of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, which was a member of Felipe Basio during his high school studies.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and to have his dust scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio, a very young man, left the city of Saltillo to attend the College of Aviation in Sapopana, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had his head turned even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, “as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo.”
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for a graduation ceremony for his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving a plane.
He's being dragged down the last path.
Shots from the guns were fired in honor of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, in the mercenary in the mercenary led by Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, people from the village and the state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Sicilians of Mexico, the Uzbeks themselves, and the Uzbeks.

Three bodies found abandoned on the N.L. Cadereyt farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderite Himenes, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found on the 1.5-kilometer Caderet Highway towards Santiago, at a height in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that in the village house, the wall of which was painted beige and brown, the gate was open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one metre away was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there was no Gils on the site.
At the gate of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group another, also in it and in the gates there are several holes from the bullet.
11 arrested in Kaderaite
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kaderite, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the colony of Los Alvero, and one person, who was in captivity, was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., military personnel made a patrol ride in the village of Staroye Rancho in Kaderite, when they saw a car without a number sign with two men in the saloon.
After stopping them and carrying out the inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 2:00 p.m., one of their associates was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, which, upon seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderite.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and the damage it has done to the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monty, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will occupy its positions.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with political parties in an attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form the government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well-designed," he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less common, as Italy struggled with the political and financial crisis, which brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a package of hard-earned savings required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure on Monti to speed up, unstable markets have fixed Italy’s 10-year BTP bond income more than 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Employers’ Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monti: “We said we would actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty’s chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monty’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centrist-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because until now many of its members have opposed the government majority, consisting of technocrats that form Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Montenegrin government should have strong parliamentary support to carry out reforms that are likely to be unpopular with hard-earned reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could become a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his series of meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a state debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monty said his government would exist until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before he could appoint a new election.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that it should be composed only of technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the process affecting the financial situation.
Political sources have reported that the mutual distrust and disapproval of the parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
Spanish players have more experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, 10 have already played in 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare 22 players caused by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a full list of A-class selection games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star League and in the strong Premier League clubs of England, have been very active in the league and in the local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see him leading the list in the Spanish team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subissarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javier Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javier were recognized as the best of last week's UEFA along with another player from the Iberian team, Subissarreta, with 126 matches and Schalke's striker Raul Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
It’s almost close to a hundred Carlos Pujol with 97 games.
Javier Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta - with 62, Sesque Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
On the Costa Rica side next to Michael Umana, left-sided Junior Diaz with 48 games and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Then, only five crossed the line in 30 games: Kaylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36, and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain have been played by Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santa Catarina (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 outings on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The others didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Adder have not made their debut yet.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored twice as many points as Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country on tour in honor of 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive Viva interview, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the assertion of bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on a tour of South America in honor of 20 years of work and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is a excerpt from the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask about it because there is some devotion to the band; the fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have been held over the past two weeks.
We’ve had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to surf and jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfers friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places to surf, this is how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you’ve done a great show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show out of the possible with the most diverse songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoire.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that what we've been doing for over 20 years makes it a dream.
We are happy with our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We are happy to travel around the world, where we have always wanted to go.
Everything happens very successfully for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the flower of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this great group of people.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s healthy when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from one city, but it’s much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and for us the honor of being part of the sound of Seattle that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for such a long time.
Yes, four of us were 21 years old together, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands do.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and secondly, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, we have also opened musical roads that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and it couldn’t have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour for too long, because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it has done without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release a single album until Andy Woods died.
There were a lot of disappointments because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we still have a lot of close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I heard the song or saw the photo, I was thinking about the person I was in disbelief.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local Las Robertas group will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open up?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video suggestions, and it was the group that we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it has to be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Eddie Weddere, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Antwill, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam achieve success in maintaining the topicality of the range, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who appeared at the same time, and if it matters now, I think it's great because it's music that's worth listening to, and the teams are like Mudhoney.
At first, your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It’s interesting because, I think, there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed was playing them, I was crying, when I was listening to them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you grow up and in your life there was some trauma and you lost a family member or friend, these events begin to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fukhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized at a state hospital on Tuesday for an investigation into the loss of muscle strength that is being observed in the legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which caused him to have been operated on four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told the N television channel that Fuchimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fuhimori should be a candidate for a pardon from humanitarian considerations; however, he said he did not want this because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations on tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, to which were added other diseases such as strong erosive gastritis, gallbladder cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, diarrhea.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the forces of the army extermination team, which acted in secret during the first years of his rule.
Muhyka goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by Uruguayan President Jose Muhica and made up of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and start negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Muhyka will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the most important point of the comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the schedule, published by Ugruvo.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will “beneficial for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations,” the South American country’s leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Muhik is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France that happened when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a tax haven list at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remain tax havens from the international community, a statement that sparked Uruguay's protest and a recall for his ambassador's consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group created from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in essence, had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has been trying to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements to leave this “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
Next PostNext Tired water pipe will become three-dimensional with “Super Mario 3D Land”
Super Mario struggled tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but never before did he do it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to announce how stereoscopy will work without glasses,” said the head of the press service of Nintendo in Spain, Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specifically developed under this platform" because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo representative said that despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, the majority of experts will go “second round” on the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the hero’s return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo bribes the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the plumber with his lips needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colom Guarantees Extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process had begun for Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for a $70 million laundering plot.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he did not "put his hands on" legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrokin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for the sale of drugs.
What Colom has done shows an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of missing Q120 million in the Department of Defense during the presidential term, which was a process leading to extradition, but the Department of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove Helped 6,000 Young People at Risk Group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of Trinijove’s first 25 years of social support organization are important: 6,000 young people subjected to social isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
To this end, it is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results at a ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Velia in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of work, and problems with drugs or marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions, which in these 25 years cooperated with the association.
The different political views during the election showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by the former consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the former lieutenant mayor and the current ecosocialist, a member of the municipal council of Richard Gom.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats is the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Clerics and La Caixa Social Work CEO, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "appears to be a good basis".
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the accumulation of hope in people experiencing difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and work done to it,” he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people yesterday at noon voluntarily left the building, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated their neighbors, according to a court decision without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a pass control here," the manager said.
The squatters, who captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, allocated all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially the banks from under the alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the attackers of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors to the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that organized there, the frequency and intensity.
The club’s owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner, and it’s been nine months since he “forgives” her rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal group PP, advisor Alberto Fernand Diaz, called for last week "immediate evacuation of the building to solve the problems of coexistence and the common spirit that have arisen among neighbors and degradation in this area".
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squatters invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had broken into.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to constantly resist the culturelessness that is being created in the building.”
So, yesterday, police officers evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police went to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after discussions about contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now defunct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colcerola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SCB, in 1987 the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not to the north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
Positioning Colcerola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild caban in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 contests for many other gates in Colcerol.
Under the gates is understood the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put a door on the field.
The question is one: Necklace? A park or a mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic for discussion among all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people meet each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the shoreline it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We have to admit that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Apart from that, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colcerola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “gate of Colcerola” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we must act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising due to “uncertainty in predicting public space” after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum’s platform “with its swan songs”.
The first fear is actually the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Limiting something is preparing for the next step,” the transition means.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current [as far as the General Capital Plan (GSP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colcerola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "should not be missed by the ears", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a passage that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should lead interdisciplinary teams ("success", he asserts), which should only be "a factor", which should have been created.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that calls the name of this part is complex, as the rules of the contest lack the general type of Colcerola: "16 cross-country competitions have been announced," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no point in reading it as long as it takes.
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for a single gate can intersect by program and definition with the architect's project for the neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council is eager to ensure that the strip directly over Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the representative of the Red Casino court pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative at Red Casino apologized to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of blackmailing the mayor’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to conduct a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor’s brother and on September 2, he was arrested and placed in prison for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Crimes of Heritage, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed at the place for 49 days, following the provisions of the second restraining order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderet for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in prison with the average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay in a municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigations it is quite obvious proof of Jonas' guilt, such as a levy of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmakers in exchange for a settlement.
On Monday, the Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to ask for forgiveness for the region’s mayor’s brother, so that in the coming hours he could get his freedom.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gomes if he had recovered the damage and who of the partners of the gambling house gives a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to pronounce the name.
On the basis of record 197/2011, a lawful pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabale, and no statements can be made afterwards on the proceedings that were planned against him; nor will there be any compensation for damages and punishment.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost at 15:50, he was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
The serving court, Jorge Janes, went to the prison of the San Nicolas municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He shall also inform him of an immediate order of release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Peres Hacome talks about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter hit directly on the ground in a state of complete destruction.
During a press conference Dionysio Peres Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The elements that appear to show that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its buoyancy.”
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transportation of passengers.
The ground in this place has a deviation of seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruising speed and that it happened on soft lifting ground.
“This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of the impact,” he said.
At the press conference, SCT owner Peres Hacome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft went to the border between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected Routes:
It is possible that due to the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Kuernavak valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the strike and the last record from the radar of the aircraft are likely to coincide before the strike there was no loss of control or change of direction of the flight.
Dispersion of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the blow came to the front and side line.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No obvious signs of a fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, undiscovered evidence remains in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent research show that there could have been multiple contacts with the earth.
During work on the site were found pieces of an aircraft at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a deviation from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study on a larger area than the outlined area near the site where the crash occurred, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces fat cell gene search program
Social Protection Leads Research to Find the Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; It’s Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which has been named the protocol "Child and adolescent obesity genetics", which will provide an estimate of the signs associated with obesity.
In a statement, the head of the Division of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to take part by going to MSSI sports centers, taking part in the study, to the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m., tests will be conducted with the participation of children.
He stressed that the protocol began to run at the sports center in Cuautemoca (in the west of the state of Mexico), and since October 8, the events have been held at the sports center in Nesaualcoyotla (east of the state of Mexico).
After the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
November 14 will be World Diabetes Day, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 with parental permission and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They are also asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to the appearance of diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis will be carried out (to identify genes that are associated with childhood oedema).
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects the concerns of health care professionals about worrying about weight gain among children.
In medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006, it is said that there was a growth in just 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 percent suffered from obesity, in the case of girls, 47 percent; in the case of excess weight, there was also a significant growth," said MSSI.
He said the rationale for searching for markers was based on the fact that the country’s population differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans are 65 percent descendants of American Indians, 30 percent descendants of Europeans, and five percent descendants of Africans, and this condition has affected genes that are linked to diabetes and overweight.
He explained that basically, the consequence of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn off the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children who can identify whether they have any degree of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of a violation of metabolism and even prediabetes.
With the information being treated with complete confidentiality, the doctor transmits it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the lifestyle that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main reasons that provoke excess weight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using transportation to keep small spaces.
This is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. an increase in consumption of sweet beverages and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature impacts.
If the signals sent by the road cover were to be taken into account, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand units for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Errera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, and adds that the process of astro
In his lecture Technological view of the pits, read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible, develops a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to the bitumen, but with better resistance both at the temperature and at the same time.
Errera Naher said this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of the roads and thus counteract the formation of food.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some - a high molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others - a low molecular weight called maltenes, which together give the road surface its character.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is in the fact that at high temperatures around 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures, it is boiling at very low temperatures.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineering specialist.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico are mostly covered with a flexible cover, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen, composed of small stones deposited in the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is immersed in a bitumen.
When moving vehicles and making efforts, it helps the forces to distribute very well along the road cover.
If it were modified asphalt, they would have been even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer, which is called the layer of wear, which is made of small stone, is actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road coverage that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires adequate thickness, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates the cover and it is difficult to get out of there, this causes softening of all layers of the cover and, therefore, the formation of food.
In the formation of the esophagus, he said, the first layer of wear is worn out and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, this process should be paid attention to at the first signs of programs of current repair.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of a hole, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the coating must always be related to the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of ions.
Rafael Errera said that there is still much to learn about bitumen and to do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to make pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Vala not have to do to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valéry received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca remained only to wish to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serra was to be pleased that she was on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.

A question that many people are asking:
What was not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the performances showed that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful face of the Vogue, the Corolla, the Corolla, the Corolla
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to conclusively answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?” posed by Martin Murilla Gomez from the literary society Let’s Be Respected.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of worship, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my childhood – Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at the moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Burning of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term "culturation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: “The universal wisdom, what happens, is what has to happen.”
And all of you, please, read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the sound hypotheses – Valé has been burned by favouritism.
A reporter from Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> suggested that, as she was preferred, she was not met with ovations, and she was the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Culinary competition of Oster, the audience vote for the best national costume, and Queen of the Cornish, the Queen of the Cornish, the Queen of the West), "the owl.
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit on Hillton Beach and during two of her shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “Like Home” program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become queen.”
In addition, the representative of Vallee had recently avoided communication with the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valé failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dotty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must not only look at the exterior, but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative Valé was mistaken for defects in strawberries and fibrosis, which was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physique.
Queen's adviser Jorge Ernan Orosco notes that Melina did not have the best body that she had, "but the problems of abdominal fibrosis, which was not very noticeable to me, forced her to lose points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Kromos magazine believes that the mistake of a representative of Valle de Cauca was that she would undergo surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the award, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction happened last night, they say that it was the guy that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for losing the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether this is the case or not, the fact is that today Melina has a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions directly designated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who recognized the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminal from Cali went down in history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, the criminalist CTI Kali entered the story as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at the CTI, this week it was time to “work” Elizaar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Texas, who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days in the jungle to reach the places where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valais and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. canyons and stones.
On the week of the operation of Elizaar to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big came up.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Kauk to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it in its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without beards, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much fat.
But the prints don't scream.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the prints of the body’s fingers to those that were in the pictures.
His eyes were not deceived: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSK.
Searching for fingerprints
For a specialist in the dactyloscopy of the Sijin unit from Cali, the recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliza Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in the disclosure of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopy specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When detained, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their prints and look for them at the base.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall home, because in this place the thief leaned on his hands to take possession of the safe, full of treasures and money.
“It’s hard to work with walls because they’re not comfortable surfaces for taking prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire hand and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he said.
The fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles from under the liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that in the commission of the crime a relative could be suspected and, in fact, fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A CTI dactyloscopy specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to places where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or ribbon is used to remove them.
After that, images of the prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of criminals, or are entered in the register.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that glitters, not all that you touch, leaves imprints on itself.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
‘Infuriated People’ Challenge New York Authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke down the camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court’s decision to expel the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
Members of the Wall Street Arrests movement on Tuesday challenged the New York authorities when they tried again to penetrate, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Bolshoi Park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get there thanks to a court order that allowed “angry people” to break up the camp on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the drive, capturing the park in the north of the city, where further aces were held.
"Our idea is that, since the court does not allow us to break down the camp on the square, we will break down the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for returning to Zukotta and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Uttria movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was personally ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had come to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuations.
In addition, the "angry people" began to seize a new park, located at the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is located in the vicinity.
At least an hour they could occupy this place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but Efe said he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization ensures that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as an intermediary in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zucotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, in which the legality of today's morning protestors' expulsion will be considered.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time, and even gave those copies to police officers guarding the area, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said some of the officers had been killed.
The court order prohibits the authorities from carrying out the evacuation of members of the Wall Street Arrest movement and forcing them to comply with “laws that were issued after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from regaining access to the park with shops and other property.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city has suspended the opening of public space and protesters have been informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to reopen tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zucotti Square, which was carried out at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and a decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the square to be cleaned because it had become "a place where people came to not protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors feared "to live in fear."
The evacuation, which took place this morning, was reprehensible and shows that deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesman for the movement added, which condemns the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for the Wall Street Arrests also pointed out that they intend to organize “grandiose actions” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will become the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on Russell Peters' Christmas TV show on December 1.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Big Repair", a rescuer in "The Malibu Rescuers", Bunny in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show on kanad.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the coroner (ballad performer) Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear on the December 1 episode of Russell Peters's Christmas TV show, in the role of a very special Maria.
CTV today presented the footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widely distributed online home porn video, where she features with her then-husband, drummer of the band "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" Demmy Lee, the singer of the band "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e"
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as the lead in Charlie Shin's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special is attended by Canadian singer Bubble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March on the Argentine model Luciana Lopilato and who also knows the meaning of the scandals.
Bublé recently named Kim Kardashian a "sucky" American during one of her concerts in New York City
Japan Resurrected After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the slump that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has brought about the nuclear crisis, the most terrible disaster the country has endured since the rising sun of World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million — a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be going on.
After three losing quarters in a row, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in the annual calculation.
Registered in the second quarter – for the Japanese financial year starting in March 2012 – also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The resurgence may be partly explained by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% reduction in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real break in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for a crisis to intensify – or reshape – the infrastructure, using the levers to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1% under the action of increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Climo Iena
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that will dave, like a stone, into the company’s account.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, blame the yen in their low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to occupy the EU’s peripheral countries, the government of Esihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be mindful of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts disruptions in the global economy, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone has even fallen below the average value, which is at the level of 100 points, after it fell by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again gives ground for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With periphery premiums for risk and uncertainty looming in the parks, Greece is still wandering around the labyrinth, which is leading to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new Ellad transitional government is imposed by Brussels’ demands rather than the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there are no new alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-day period agreed upon at his appointment may not be enough for their application, the leader of the conservative party "New Democracy" will not be on the sidelines of Antonis Saima.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive power.
A package of 24 programs to increase the employment of the population, reforms of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax avoidance will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives took one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, organizations that should freeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter on the agreement’s requirements.
But the European Commission, still feeling outraged by the effect of the Papandreou-styled referendum’s claims, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid if the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties can’t sign the bill.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Economy Amadeo Altafai said the trio's inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government what "should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet set.
In the Greek club there are enough strings for a while longer.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "main" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, the essence of which, she said, is that it is a "tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the goals of the millennium set by the United Nations in 2015 and the end of the year.
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all "responsibility", says Donja Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "ensure the best possible creation of new abilities for the people and people".
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties that we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would escape the poverty into which they were immersed.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world “was on the path started years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Mrs. Sofia as “an act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the tool's father as "an amazing idealist in general in the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the spot.
This experience was adopted a year later by the first World Summit in Washington, D.C. and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere", said Her Majesty, whose "relationship with this project has brought trouble to the
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech, calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Himenes said that solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment”.
Himenes concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and solid course aimed at eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” the governments of the developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a cost-cutting victim.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, highly appreciated the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "departed, before whom all doors are closed", and the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, who welcomed his "duke" in the presence of all the people, welcomed the two-faced
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it emerged in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is not as strict as it should be, today in relation to Greece and perhaps tomorrow in relation to Italy.
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, tabled for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted several minutes, which merited his speeches by Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schoeble, the Europhile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the chancellor, “it’s time for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which make it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schoeble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is against it, and the HDS leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the votes of each member of the European Union in the governance of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm down the situation in her party, the chancellor has increased the number of links to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but she has not sought to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticise "higher" Germany.
Although in the draft resolution on Europe the whole paragraph is devoted to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Fraud With Hospital Leaves?
Following the money laundering, the UMP and the government began an attack on hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and to speak on this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose out of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the campaign for the right to re-election to presidents, most want to focus on hospital records.
First of all, in terms of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the start of payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his salary in four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on the civil servants one day without payment of the sickness allowance (the civil servants still did not have to wait for the payment of the allowance, unlike the three-day waiting period).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-emphasized the topic of fraud, with a view to abuse in the issue of hospital records.
Control will be tighter and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all illegally received payments," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Saturday, Nov. 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuses with hospital records.
Indeed, they have been subject to constant control and political attacks since 2002 that bear fruit.
People in France are sick no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s take a look at the numbers in the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation costs in 2008 of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 thousand million amounted to 5% of the total expenditure on health care.
Of this amount, 46% related to statutory leave and accidents in production and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health-related expenditures were made up.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they didn’t take a day off from hospital.
Another study, this time related to health insurance, claims that in 2010 37 percent of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15 percent from 15 days to one month, 15 percent from one to three months, and 11 percent lasted longer.
Comparing these figures to the numbers of European neighbors, it can be seen that French workers are no more likely to take a hospital than workers from any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall share of absences in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared to 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to "gray" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 has led to a systematic check-up of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were “unjustified” or too long, amounting to 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unsubstantiated” for several million workers who received hospital letters.
Figures that show very few cases in comparison, for example, with figures of "gray" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominic Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million of unearned budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was announced on Monday in parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not enough to carry out this task.
“In order to achieve the economy’s goals, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening a vote of confidence debate in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “main task” of the new government, as “the country’s presence in the Eurozone is on the map,” he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “up to about 9%” from GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the New Government's Action
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned his party would not support additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the goals of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his disapproval of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU will not unlock the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they will support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had not said that he had not been told that he was not.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, says the committee of experts
Canadians refused to die, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee claims that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not counting the cases of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the penal code to allow suicide with foreign aid and euthanasia when the choice is made by circumstances, and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Whether or not it is due to medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
The highest rate in the country in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts, who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse in application, that is, the implementation of euthanasia or suicide with the help of a foreign aid may or may not do so with respect to people who may not like it.
On the contrary, confirmed during the teleconference of Josephine Downey, who presented the report, the majority of such cases were in those countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Josephine Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe that this will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of life.
66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are of lesser value.
As for people who have assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that a legally justified termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in the spirit of respect for the end-of-life refusal of medical care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it is not used to numb physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts on health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Dr. Pierre Deshan, a health law expert, described the position as “extreme” by experts who signed the report because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Metro Deshan, who yesterday discussed the summary of the report.
Metre Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is contesting, inter alia, the report's data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus Condemns 'Conspiracy'
Syria is becoming more isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, there was increased diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar Assad, who, with Russia’s support, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan stepped down President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to step down in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life," the King of Jordan, who is next to Syria, told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, pointing to Syria, a neighboring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" followed by the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course in relation to the repressions in Syria, said Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Deraa area of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shelling of heavy machine guns in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country is nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the League of Arab States' decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, ensuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to exclude Syria from the League of Arab States, it is currently studying “the mechanism of protection of civilians and requires the recruitment of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers into the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke for sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repressions of the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia.”
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November and providing, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting is going, and the release of the arrested demons.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement a plan to exit the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
ITALY
Monti takes time in markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not in parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of the program, which involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
Speaker of the House of Deputies Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of the dozen or so ministers of the country, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new government will have to act before 2013, the dates of the next election, he said.
According to Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti assured that by joining the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Ren said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet the target budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, called for, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian "boss boss" Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth, cannot meet the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence in the face of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor", symbolizing "serious calls" and "second Italy", according to the authors.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as by April 2012, Italy is expected to make payments on state debt obligations of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 million.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds in methods".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company producing nanoalms in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, IAEA mentions “the obvious signs that Iran’s development” of the nuclear detonator system “has contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also told the agency that he has worked most of his career on this technology in the framework of military nuclear.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes has increased by 50%.
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while during the same period other forms of violence on racial and religious grounds declined slightly or did not change.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in attacks on Jews and a 14% increase in the overall number of rapes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, the Human Rights First said, adding that “increases in cases of violence against Muslims are particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious violations of human rights,” said Paul Lejander, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
“Crimes on the ground of hatred” in federal law are the legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish for acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and today’s sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and is becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, what makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new tab “activities” and other “names” allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other “tweets”, the Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they will post messages, if they will sign up for new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “for a small percentage of users in August” before it went into widespread use across the network on Monday, Twitter’s Caroline Penner said.
Twitter, which for a long time has been known as intuitively quite opaque and as a social network uses rather vague terms (RT for someone else’s messaging, #followfriday for recommendation to track other users), is mostly used by more experienced users, as well as by more experienced users.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, it’s overwhelming and it’s too much like Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria-Hungary
Introduction to the Constitution of the "Golden Rule" of the budget
The leadership of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the budget "golden rule" into the constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the credit rating by the avionics reservists.
Chancellor of the Social Democrats Werner Feimann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian government debt amounting to 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper limit of the norm of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the state of G<0xC3><0xB6>teborg.
If Austria’s ability to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest on three thousand million euros more each year, said Vice Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria met the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of state and government demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decree, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and the land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to force the public debt to fall below the 60% mark, fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Eshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historic mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a "refugee" in these turbulent times of the global economy and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar at 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to recover itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile seed of recovery.
The world's third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic indicators.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy managing body Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", making it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising up to 55,000 million yen (519 thousand euros) the ceiling of the amount that it invests.
Eurozone
rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties with the payment of loans by euro area countries in a difficult situation, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Treatful investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the load of new doubts from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has pursued its vision of Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsuige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the euro area will hit a single currency that has continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party congress on Monday, in which a resolution was adopted, providing, in particular, for the country in a difficult position, to leave the eurozone without leaving the EU together.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6%
Lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that is of great concern.
This morning, Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same repayment period reached 6.2%.
These difficulties, with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked at the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the “basic task” of his government.
Spain was hit by markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The gap between interest rates on 10-year debt obligations between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expected growth in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected by 0.3%, thanks to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, despite this, revised to reduce the figure of the second quarter, with a fall in 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are a reason to reflect on the fate and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are studied.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now we have 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to replenish the growing deficit of fossil fuels in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, not forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance - a theme that has disappeared from the ecological environment.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which puts its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or in Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who continue their projects decisively.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its set, resuming the construction of the station, which was cut off after the Tri-Mil Island accident.
Although Germany’s model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal.
In a few months all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion in the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the interrupted wind; which is why carbon emissions and electricity prices respectively are 65% and 50% higher than the average of the Euro.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Because in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a key factor in the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create the industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole range of international small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to donate a large number of these enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,000 million a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrical engineer will order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its manufacturer?
In order to solve the equation about energy, one must recognize that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of Areva’s low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions indicates the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centers, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with safety.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that allows to counter such phenomena.
As it is being considered by all the energy experts who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudiced maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "state of human rights".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news releases when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of May 23) said that France “does not need foreign talents, quarries and waitresses.”
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree on this.
On the right side was Jacques Shirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left side - Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from around the world".
The difference is only in generosity.
In 2005, fear of invasion of the country by the Polish waterway was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limited himself to banalities, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us of in a recent book on the economy and the country that summarized the latest data on immigration (Special People: How migration shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the publishing house of Princeton University, p.
The restriction of immigration leads to a weakening of growth and reduces employment.
The fear of the impact of immigrants is based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, provoking a reduction in wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than replacing the local labor force, performing jobs that lack the local labor force.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the local workforce, while the most skilled ones work in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complement that exists between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the income of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of 0.6-0.9% in real long-term wages.
And it is without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel Prize winners, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo – all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, giving on average 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany, arriving at the age of 30, will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) to the state budget in his lifetime on average of 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was going to be “toothed” in the missing points of growth.
The mentioned teeth, which were used to scare away immigrants, gave just the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to make sense of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to be finally enthralled by its enemies, it was enough to organize the vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the “Little” it is known that this comes from the superficiality of thought.
A universal vote, although a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and may even become a “tool of repression,” as philosopher-Republican Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palindrome of a true-liest Greek referendum will have a double illuminating effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change in policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now aiming not in that direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
Card Blanch for an absolute European monarch or a jump with his legs tied to the abyss of nationalism – what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine, but of a joint, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of Europe's sovereignty, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is necessary to urgently restore the management of the European project under the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debt, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Exiting the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delors all now demand a European economic government.
Let's go.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into being is another madness and a new obstacle.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” republicans.
Revolutions of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, of the real people’s European sovereignty.
In order to create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Non-contact chip cards are becoming more and more widespread.
The world chip-card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important sector of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases, is simply by making a map of the reading device.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold in the world, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected to be 580 million units) and will make up almost 10% of the global chip-card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, a long-delayed Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 400,000 contactless Visa cards in circulation.
But big stores are growing in pace.
This year, Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to supply their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their customers cards adapted for contactless use,” said Gerard Nebui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, i.e. a mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Communication of the Near Field) technology needed to carry out such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they really have to fly away next year.”
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday that the experiment would be conducted from December to June of the following year in Cannes.
The iPhone devices of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with sockets that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch on the market an offer that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Paris is concerned about links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-awaited links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now confident of this.
“The way these two organizations are using, and intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leucour and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone sim cards belonging to the terrorists.
This is terror.
The analysis of the calls has indicated several interlocutors located in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is believed to be close to Aqmi and to the sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent in Boko Haram’s actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The Washington-led international community is now putting pressure on the Abuja to pay attention there to the problems Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed the group as a community of enlightened people who were not of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri by the mosque, school and imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram — which means “Western education is sin” — preaches the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the dishonest central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern cousins.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jose, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first attack of the deceased on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the United Nations’ local representation will become their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodlak Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all available information.
The World as Republican Candidates See It in Presidents
With respect to China, Iran and Israel’s aid Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplifications and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world by means of simple, or more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to presidential candidates from Republicans, voters would believe it.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying the loud but devoid details of foreign policy statements that are traditionally a strong side of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of getting out of the "Old Good Party", threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries into its industry.
The worse it will be if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to understand complex foreign policy, has failed to overcome a position that engenders emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who holds the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear program.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also promised to strengthen Israel’s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of the case.
He recently called for confronting China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – apparently not knowing what China has already possessed of it since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to the torture of suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also recommends Kane, Perry, and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to tone down the fight against terrorism.
They justly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature conclusion of the "fish" from Iraq, his exploits in Libya, which brought him a reputation for weak politics.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers Obama to be a positive balance of national security, which has eliminated bin Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in the sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is launched.
It is estimated to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the performance of the orchestra and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fijon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte have returned a symbolic valve that controls Russian gas's entry into the Western European network.
According to the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will enter Western Europe each year on the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will actually allow you to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding passing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debates, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of Europe’s depletion of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” said Francois Fijon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
Underwater pipeline is made of steel, enclosed in concrete, to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left from the Second World War.
“One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, North Stream’s press secretary.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without gaps along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but project managers gave up on it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state-owned company would forever settle on its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will shut down the gas flow in less than a minute,” Jens Mueller said.
So, in the case of a leak of gas contained in the gas pipeline, it will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers, who designed seams designed for the flow only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline will be carried out by a submarine robot that pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as by the apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped device is inserted into the pipe 1 meter in diameter and is pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any minor repairs.
Gas circulation is carried out only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called the North Stream, which was tasked with building and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Z<0xC3><0xBC>ge, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full amount, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Mueller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 thousand million for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmina on a sandy shore, planted with coniferous trees.
Valves with a height of 4.5 meters form an outlet gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it can be transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine Brand Blocker
Moleskine, created by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has the scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of candles.
Moleskine's block is easy to find on the rectangular black cover, on the rubber, on the yellowish-white pages, as if yellowish with time.
However, Moleskine’s book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, has decided to launch designer notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The block is inspired by the old technique of production, molasses - lacquered cotton rubber fabric, which was used, for example, to cover the chamomile.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought into line with today’s taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult thing for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand in Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We have gone a long way from production in the first years, when only 3,000 blockchains were produced.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting up a typical buyer’s profile is difficult because the blockchain equally attracts a businessman, a student, and a person with a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views, and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small cities and has been able to gain wide popularity.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the appearance of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition "Environmental Path" where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard print on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, handles, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that led to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has inscribed a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disability employment begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy that began in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still two times higher than the average, namely 19% versus 9% for the general population.
Disturbing?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
“In 15 years, we have made significant progress.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2, but 3 times higher.”
“There is still a lot of work ahead.”
It should be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them, more elderly: 37% older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are the essence of the problem,” said Christian Graben, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire people with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on Cité’s order showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented themselves as total people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally undervalued.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of the disabled employees set out in the law passed in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are estimated at 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” said Pierre Blanch, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which raised taxes, put a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects the growth of consciousness, in particular, in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with the number of employees from 20 to 49 have disabled workers versus 82% of organizations with the number of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45pm) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We will not come to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stadium of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after the departure of his striker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian.”
"I want to move on," said Lilly.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, this is one thing, he justifies.
“I’ve been in Lille all year and I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn points.”
Left in reserve, ahead of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "flash".
Don’t forget, though, about the concept of “pleasure.”
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and won campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Matya (Debushi), Johan (Kaba) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our roads have been crossed.”
“To have the opportunity to play against them is pure happiness!”
Leekens kindly recalled the "proudness".
"Pride" to play in a "holiday match".
“The pride” also claims as a “neighbor” that France “has again become a very high-level team” just a year after the injury in Nice.
“Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in a single plane with the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see to it in future matches, including against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his rematch against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the team, which he has held since September 2010, qualifies for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
Considering 0-0 on Friday in hell Zenica it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, she failed to achieve the goal that would calm her down.
“It’s a good result that, however, carries a certain risk.”
But at its brightly lit stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the public, which should be in excitement, although the match will be very tense,” said Bentu, an optimistic but reasoning figure.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are confident that we can win," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be at Euro 2012,” said Karlus Kairos’ successor.
No one on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could get the Bosnians to do it.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merits and players that have a lot of individual merits," he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "not giving them time to think".
A good idea, if only this time it turned out to be realistic.
