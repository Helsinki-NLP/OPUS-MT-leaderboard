The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for color people traveling to Missouri on the basis of state discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s road recommendation for the state of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to pay greater attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents,” the statement read.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, which make it easier to defend racist-motivated acts before the court, as well as as as as as a result of the actions of law enforcement agencies that aim inappropriately at minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are being stopped by police only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated allegations directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a male black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he was hit by gasoline while traveling across the state and was thrown into jail without charge of committing the crime.
The travel recommendation also points out a recent statement by the state’s top state representative, Missouri, which states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to be prepared – they should carry money with them to pay for the bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel the state.”
According to the FBI’s current numbers for reporting hate crimes, in 2015 in Missouri, there were a hundred cases of hate behavior, reaching 16th place among all states.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state actors to detain people based on violations of this law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recent advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is not even at peace after 12 years!
Model Sally Anne Bowman is murdered.
In 2005, a girl from Croydon was murdered by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant she worked in, he stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex with each other and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched carefully criminal work to examine the scene of the crime.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted to the court only the assault of the youth, and the lawyer claimed that his client found the girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police arrested him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson fought fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he said lyingly.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself, but she could have been cut, but it was empty.
Lewis was supposed to punch her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and blamed him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his tenacity and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn himself with marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told police.
He said he felt an adrenaline rush.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people in freedom who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror's mother told the deceased girl Linda information about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the assailants, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither prudent nor conservative," says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague boutique of Intimate.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It started off unscathed, about 12 years ago.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a bicycle trip to Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of extremely-looking vibrators.
“Different dwarfs and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different,” he tells me about lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic tools Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, and so offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left so that he could devote himself to another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in Prague’s Benedictine Street, it operates an Intimacy boutique, where it sells erotic aids in a way that is usually offered luxury bags or shoes.
Why wouldn't I?
It is also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you say?
But come on, don't be such puritans!
It was the Berlin-based Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept to the erotic trade than everyone is used to here.
No hidden excursions, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited rather than in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to think about how to understand the Prague trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimate was liked by both of them.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s also, you might say, gentle,” he says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, she won the variant, which distributed the store to the garden of delight and the bedroom, which is dominated by the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first we didn’t think it was perfect, because it’s not on the main street, but thanks to it he sat down to the name Intimate.
He's intimate.
It’s in the street next to the main one, so no one is cheering the customers,” Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a trade that will be different, with brand-name nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they entered such a store at all.
When I walked into the Intimacy store half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though there is only female service in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male leg does not welcome here.
Mostly men go here to buy gifts for their girlfriend.
“Men usually can’t estimate the right size and choose rather larger,” Martin smiles over a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the experienced clichés that women need some big help, and that's not true.
So a man in a good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
In the same way, men prefer mostly black clothes, whereas women tend to prefer the pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face it must be clear that I do not know who is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
I have a teenage need to indulge myself with admiration for what a serious tone the explanation is given to me.
It's like it's not going to get wet.
And it doesn't really make sense.
It is for a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't think it would be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the form of a seahorse.
He took care of the fact that women began to become more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He completely crushed the taboo that some men can endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"There are different options," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
With a loving connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it's got to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly, a masturbator is sold, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical vagina, but “rather like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, however, it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese were going to suffer a lot for erotic help, I guess.
"That's the reality of the internet," I explained.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the boutique Intimate, sells worldwide, still makes up about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not prudent at all.
On the contrary, we are a whole nation.
Definitely different from countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical store client moves between 35 and 50 years old and "has a certain experience with sex life, but with some help.
She will come up with something nicer, more quality, which would complement her partner’s life, or for herself.” In order to return, Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka make sure that every product is fully functional.
We also don’t want to indulge in a special type of bondage and latex, because we don’t have room for it, but it doesn’t fit here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who always had the guts to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would get in the way of them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
At least the first prize was the mentioned seahorse 'and this triggered a change throughout the industry.
They started to give up cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-conscious, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I must say that I was quite pleasantly surprised at how many people buy the design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to the Venus Balls by Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present – that erotic aids can be done differently, beautifully, with a story, both within the Czech Republic and abroad.
Ann’s story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is additionally manufactured by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may be a little against the flow, but it seems important to me to keep up with the developments in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything,” he later describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
It does not have a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are at maximum disappointments.
"But also you will start to smile." Currently, Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> has a vibrator on offer, on which you can let yourself make a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, it should add vibrating eggs and other news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what is right are.
Is there anything Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> would not have given birth to?
It is very difficult to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to the other, so rather we define ourselves as a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them will go to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her friend with a nature length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write to him that we don't have anything like that.
The question is whether any of us have made a joke," Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
And that happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gotta.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dry is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gotta’s best friend struggles with a disease that steals people’s memories.
"Yes, that's unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed the sad news to Bleska.
I know about my illness and so far I am completely in control of it due to the circumstances.
"I'm taking drugs that have to slow down the progression of the disease," he added, thanking those close to him for their support.
The whole family was willing to give up to make Karl's life easier.
Eva’s wife is trying to be at home as much as possible, and Zuzana and Tereza’s first marriage daughter, Karel’s eldest son Karl, also arrives at her father’s house on the White Mountain.
He fought cancer twice, and gave his experience to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has 60 chemotherapy treatments.
After that, he was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been told by the astrologer that I'll be here in my 90s," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
They still want to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The same disease is now being fought in the institution and actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
Chile’s parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will assess the U.S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial termination of pregnancy, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I'm sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have agreed on in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said in a statement.
The constitutional court in Chile has ten members and by the end of August should get a new president who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law that breaks the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would be attacked in court because it says it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
Members of the House postponed the vote on the bill last month until it is analysed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the proposal, and the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislation, there should be an artificial termination of pregnancy in three cases: if the woman's life is threatened, if the fetus does not have hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arises from rape.
According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s in Chile, there have been similar exceptions since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for termination of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything more sacred?
The target of Trump’s White House is now the Statue of Liberty.
An unflattering sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
The Americans could talk about it just as well as everyone else – see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of Trump’s regime, certainly knew what he was leaning towards when, during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the topic of presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he came up with a symbolic axe at the Statue.
It seems to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this he would be confounded by the multitude of owners of cruise ships and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the foundation of the monument, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller said of Acosta: “I don’t want to go down in history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the foundation additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he put it, this isn't about history.
It is primarily the haunting words of Emma Lazarus, who resonate with today’s times – called not only by immigrants, but by the poorest of the poorest: “Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go; let me go, let me go; let me go; let me go; let the poor man; let me go; let me go; let me go;
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller didn’t try to criticize poetry – he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a poster with a poem on the base of the statue, knew quite well that they were deserting themselves into a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the unity of the French and American republican government by representing a classical theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poetry, the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of evaluators.
Combining poetry with a woman’s imagination is a brilliant feminist conspiracy and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh – Jan Kr<0xC5><0xA1>titel on Trump’s rise to power – argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty actually does not invite anyone to the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “The Statue of Liberty.
It carries the legacy of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The passage does not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh's got a weird thing going on.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of a exhausted and cursed traveler, who often arrives in the heart of a new country after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will definitely know.
Their origin is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black sings praise to Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, head of the United Kingdom's athletics federation, said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge benefit to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London MS, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that in Scotland “something strange is happening” and British athletics could learn from the Scotsman.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt to that — we’re going to work on it,” Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
Scotland's athletics leaders think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laury Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the team captain.
“Elisabeth is modest.
Her introductory speech was amazing," Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or other national athletes, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unhindered feelings with which Eilidh spoke were irreparable.”
A silver medalist from the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championship, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle-distance runner Muir has set only five British and two European records in the past year.
The MS will take part in the race at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500 m track. This season he won the British Team Race and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had joined the team, but in many cases they would also attack for participation in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was chosen by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is a pleasure,” she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved when I moved.
They are athletes who will think about the front seats on the stage.
What about my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's taking place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the domestic fans and to rejoice at the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I will enjoy the unreal atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t go public if you don’t take criticism from voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
This criticism did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken from us – and stupid and dumb, we will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on starting to act like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was charged by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
The governor’s employees rejected the lawsuit as unfounded, and many “who cares” opinions appeared in the comments on the internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, that's what matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not impressive.
As you can see, your state is self-governing and strictly adhering to principles.
It turned out that it is also inverse in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people visiting the governor’s website – which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by its employees paid out of taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for the Washington Post newspaper Hogan, Amelia Chasse, a spokesman for the governor, defended the blocking of comments from the position of moderation of the posts.
However, using an image of internet trolls, spammers, or disgruntled people is too easy.
The Washington Post told a few real people that the posts had been deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and thoughtful, not rude.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md.’s lawyer, questioned about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I’ve been very politely aware that I’m disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports,” she wrote in a commentary section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that as soon as a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting so-called collective efforts, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called a “spam-focused interest” would most likely be called “defensive.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump faces a lawsuit by Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, according to District Judge James C. Cacherise, violated the first add-on in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
During the time of Washington, the low price of mail had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even at that time, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were gathered in his office criticizing his views on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with the United Kingdom.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, abroad they consume more data than at home.
Abroad, the Czech Republic consumes more of its tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, however, they have more time to browse the web, in addition, under the sun they usually do not have the possibility to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is based on O2’s recent statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the package than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our tyres runs over the winter, data consumption has increased even fifty times this summer.
In the second place in the table of data consumed, Italy was then placed.
Most minutes the Czechs depart from Germany, where many of them are expelled at work and during the summer.
Croatia, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, visits 800,000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
“Dozens of millions of photos would fit into the transmitted data,” Silvia Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1>, head of the O2 mobile segment, said in a statement.
Although Croatia leads in volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
In Austria, we go for a walking tour and an active holiday, which we do not have much time for surfing the internet.
"Moreover, the Czech Republic is heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
While in the data the operator recorded after the release of roaming fees high interannual growth, in the case of telephone calls, the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge leap ahead of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Roaming calls are used more by corporate customers on work trips," Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a comfortable atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish East Lothian administrative area, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open in the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, will play Paul Eales as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to love the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a fierce advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
The Englishman Eales will defend the title for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have a chance to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the year after my win, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when for me and my wife Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who has joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns home.

Poverty and Death in the Gold Country of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden chateau, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unscented hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time she does her daily work, such as washing laundry in the clogged water from a nearby swamp.
The bell in the room without a roof complements the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field of study.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers live in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one will be allowed to wander around the village,” Bardina says.
It is a rare sight of everyday life in the highlands of Papui, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a pre-primary public vote.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and deserted city, where you can get from the capital city of Jayapura to Nabire after a ninety-minute flight, and then a five-hour stomach running.
Public transport at this place is not working.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses adorned with bamboo fences, roofs made of corrugated sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
There were very few Indonesians looking at this place, as opposed to journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark t-shirt and shiny dress.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are among the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of American Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport won $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports timber mining at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army for the Papuans.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including an amount of $150,000 for a single officer.
The Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden hustle and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, harassed and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the Papua tribal area during the 1970s were equivalent to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture – according to another report, rape and electrocution is particularly popular – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has been burdened by the fact that Papuan resources attract to Indonesia colonists.
Of the 3.5 million people in the province, 83% are professing Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at a lower price than local Papuans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mother-mother (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, whose name is Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations in his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former treasurer secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But in Papua, that has changed very little and local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he will hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the shara at night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched this excerpt and tone, which was pronounced and later returned with four other soldiers, said local light-bearer Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the subterranean state pursued a group of children and shot them with their guns, reported the victims and witnessed events.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building and the next day, things were still going on.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting holes and performed a waita dance - in which he runs in a circle and imitates the song of birds - the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several protesters began throwing stones at the buildings.
With the escalating tension, an order was issued to the soldiers over the radio: “If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you’re allowed to shoot,” according to the TIME weekly in an official document, the content of which has never been published in the media.
Jeremiah Kayame (56), the chief of the Enarotali district Kego Koto, recognized the threat and called on the inhabitants to break up into their homes.
But no one was afraid of his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine on the porch of his vastly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shots were fired," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” John, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name, told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were linked to injuries.
The report of the murders was leaked to the Jacaranda media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave a passionate speech to Joko in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the victims’ families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
But almost immediately, excuses began to be made.
“Most of the violent acts have taken place a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 90s of the last century and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we're determined to punish these violent acts, but it won't be an easy task," he said.
In an interview on June 5 for TIME, which was held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, say that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Papua, had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with disbelief.
“In the last three years I’ve been asked a total of four times, but so far I haven’t seen anything,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many Paniai residents who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to him, he was killed by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting still doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in neighbouring Deiyai.
One person died and 17 others were injured, a dispute arose between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The rioters protested in front of the company building.
According to the police statement, the villagers threw stones at the members and were given a warning shot.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of payback,” 29-year-old Dominga Badi, who lives near the hospital, told TIME.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and expelling Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of "insurance of national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil brings poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The bread is just as unattainable.
The locals grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in fields; each of them processes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
As a rule, so few jobs are occupied by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education in order to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists in this regard.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papaya due to "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given such rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebel easternmost areas of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in the case of Papui is to a large extent limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including shootings in the Pacific Ocean.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir was appalled when he told reporters in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people spoke according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Further elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with gunfire in Pania,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of the predatory army - are reeling in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, consider their vote to be the “debt” that Jokowi must pay.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family, the victims of the Paniai shooting continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the ground opposite the police and military station.
With the knowledge that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head folded.
“What can we do?”
The French Navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
In the Pacific, the French Navy has detained a 1.46-ton yacht carrying approximately $256 million worth of cocaine.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was taken to the port of Nouméa, the metropolis of French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean, after being detained by police.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were headed, and to expose the “Lithuanian union”.
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs heading to Australia,” said Col Blanch, executive director of the agency.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for their smugglers due to its high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current strike is not the first.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem could be in homes for seniors, the solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1> could be infusions of a physiological solution that are soaked with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a man is, the lower the amount of water in his body.
“In addition, they lose a sense of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly,” M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In homes for seniors, she says, no doctor often looks after it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually solved by infusions.
"I think they should be introduced there as well, gradually, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to old people per day.
A lack of fluid can cause nausea, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration is seen as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a brain event.
The blood thickens and tightens the blood vessels in the brain, also threatens the failure of the kidneys.
Lying patients should not be covered with a feather, a cotton swab to the maximum.
The problem can also be one-time diapers.
"It's more medically demanding, but it would be ideal for the patient to occasionally expose and let the skin exfoliate," the doctor said.
The Torch has been burned for the second time in Dubai.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was set on fire, and firefighters had to evacuate all residents of 337 meters high and 79 storeys.
For the past two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (East).
All the residents of the building were evacuated and no injuries were reported. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and the alarm went off. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defense said the firefighters were able to get the fire under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could once again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to house high-rise buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation, which initiated the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, it was found that the coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police said the system of insulation and cladding of London’s Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board the aircraft.
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously passed the prohibited items through the control point of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered on board a plane with a knife or two.
Less than one percent of passengers said they had recently discovered that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents — showed that younger passengers were more likely to be in violation of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to consciously travel with an object that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7% of passengers with several thousand hours spent were passengers, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly passed through the alert a sharp object, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they intentionally passed the banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through the airport check-in and how much it did with approval.
It’s no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized items – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
Therefore, it is not surprising that TSA has amused the largest amount of liquids that have just been banned.
For some time, people thought that the TSA would handle books in the same way that it would handle packaged goods.
The transfer of liquids is permitted within domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned guidelines to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt called off his earlier decision to delay the Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, reacting to the needs of state environmental regulators more smoothly than previous governments.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when countries should start to comply with a 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that it would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “attacks with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who, prior to becoming the head of the EPA, Donald Trump held the position of Oklahoma State Attorney General, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or distanced regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden turnaround is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA enforcer had exceeded its authority in an attempt to distance the Obama administration’s plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“For the government of the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and waited until it was sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settlement and further setting plans,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation by means of a legal dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never guarantee our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can at some point use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that the regulations "will be based on healthy policies and the most accessible information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't been passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
“To address the EPA’s views – following our judicial review – is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when ordinary harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Advocates of public health and environmentalists congratulate Pruitt on his sudden change.
“It’s worrying what pressure needs to be put on us to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
He burned the man with acid, yet he's not, according to the court, dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment you are at home with your family and you laugh, the other one will suddenly change your whole life from the basics.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate met Andrew Christopherose of the United Kingdom, whose face was covered with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was provided by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at Christopheros knocked on the door.
Andreas stood up and said he was going to open it.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver that Christmas gift to the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
A man who has never seen him in his life, immediately after opening without warning, poured acid with the words, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing and I just felt an unreal pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wound.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of the patients were affected by a face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopherosis was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the deadliest thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his grief.
Today Christopheros has twelve operations behind him, which are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries suffered by the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after a difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have tissues that appear for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't back down and fight against deformation and deformity all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The assailant got involved.
As for the attack, Christopher is sure that an unknown man had to confront him.
Pachatel believed that he was revenged by a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case properly and then searched the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict on the surprise of Christopher's family changed dramatically.
"Three judges eventually came to the conclusion that the sentence should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks by pesticides has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed concern that it plans to issue new guidelines to state representatives on the classification of raw materials.
They're supposed to be classified as dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks, however, do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer sentences of deprivation of liberty on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other edible substances.
They also require that there be tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as these are various cleaning products.
In the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the eighty-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling hot flashes.
We're asleep.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to a civil defence report, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there was a flood in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged Dubai’s The Torch skyscraper in February 2015 and destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, as the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
Mrakodrap The Torch was built in 2011 and at that time it became the world’s tallest residential building at 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of twenty-three-year-old Ippolita showed a wide range of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs to Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn’t help him in the title, finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is threatened with a four-year distance and a criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of captured athletes.
A third-party player began taking steroids a year prior to he failed bodybuilding, according to his words.
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-boyfriend!
Almost Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into the hands of her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years old at the time and was already longing for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and definitely did not want to hang her career on the nail.
They were gone, but their friends remained to this day.
They also attended a press conference on TV Prima, where they met for a long time.
By chance, they both blended in a blue color.
At first they didn’t notice each other, but then they approached, and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokes when she fell behind her stomach.
Then they were afraid, and they were willing to pose to the photographers.
However, their meeting was no coincidence, as they will play together the loving couple in the new series of the Captain Exner Primera.
The Islamists were given life in the UK to prepare for the assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell to life behind bars, calling themselves Three Musketeers and planning a terrorist attack against police and the military, according to the prosecutor's office.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar crimes, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought that they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelieving", and a make-up of a gun.
This happened at a time when the MI5 Secret Service agent was putting a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror the prosecution could have caused if they were not stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convictions aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by a MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants’ claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 <0xC2><0xB0>C in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
Tuesday’s temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in the Hodoni<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xA1> Observatory, it was surpassed by Thursday, which became the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years were surpassed or levelled.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Perhaps the temperature in the Watchtower was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1> Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Pogo<0xC5><0x99>elice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as that of the Guardian, came in 2013.
It was 10 degrees lower in the west.
On Thursday, high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard there was the largest bucket in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where the mercury flowed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not exceeded.
In contrast, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, for example, the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A> website says that so far, the temperature on Thursday was only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures there began to grow until this late afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade and more significant rain could come on Sunday.
However, in most places of Moravia high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia even on Saturday.
There are no tourists in China.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
China has been trying to exert its influence for decades without the use of force.
Every year, it spends $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets and seeks to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is not doing that.
The state media there are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals last year grew by only 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspiration, China is not welcoming foreigners right with open arms, evaluates the situation in the world’s most populous country, Professor of Economics Christopher Balding of Beijing University in an article for the Bloomberg Agency.
An example of this is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, and the citizens of the others have to get a visa in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the US, therefore, the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if a person does not want to wait for long hours in the front, they must pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions are creating significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a given country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three per cent of China’s gross domestic product and has less than one per cent of all residents, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem on its own when the tourism movement uses it to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted its travel to South Korea as part of a split around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans paid for it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All of this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. central bank, China could leave as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will earn about $35 billion a year in currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, a country that is anxious to prevent the flow of capital, strikes a very painful blow.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general tenacity towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners living in China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been working very hard lately to simplify and reduce visa-granting procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they multiplied the deadly poisonous beaches.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Jeju can enjoy the youth of three rare, deadlyly poisonous beaches.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"The height and the length of the meter," said Martin Vobruba, a spokesman for the zoo.
The young men of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, will gather strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to miss them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australia's eight deadly snakes are the descendants of a breeding pair that originated in the Sydney area.
“The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the Death Eaters from around Perth,” said Vobruba, with the fact that in human care it is necessary for the mortals to winter for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a dream of African swimming cobras red.
The couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched a total of four eggs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victim, up to four meters away.
It is aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young people of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
Up to 40 days in the garden are still waiting for the hatching of the young from the dream mother black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified rewrite of the phone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for paying for the border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone interview with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>o Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The U.S. president told him he publicly condemned the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like this in the press.”
Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border as part of his campaign and announced that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also avoided publicizing the transcript of his first talk with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia was “stupid” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement – which came after President Obama’s governments – it would look like a “drug-styling” to the U.S. after that.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk spoke again at the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"There's something to be afraid of," Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, president of the ruling Law and Justice Party, told Tusk's brother.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk said, and told the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
As he left the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk on TVN 24 that was scandalized by Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me."
In his words, he does not charge prosecutors anything, but he does not doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, oppositions or people who do not like it, and I fear that I belong in this group.
It was the second time he had been interrogated.
The ex-premier was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he was questioned about the suspicions of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins have been replaced.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
“The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU,” Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said on Catholic television.
He added that any conflict with Russia would deprive Tusk of a chance to win the most important seat in the Union, from which, however, Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take it into account.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour hearing at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
Even then, he did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his appeals to the hearing were seen as part of an obvious attempt by the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>sk to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking it to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Attorney General.
The call for hearing came in the wake of the election of Tusk by the head of the European Council, whom Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but vainly to prevent, among other things, when visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk’s mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlov<0xC3><0xA1> protested on her own.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n left Warsaw at the helm.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies of Barma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections, which took place in 2013.
This comes from a declaration that regulates the delivery of voting tickets to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update of it, it is currently in the commemorative proceedings.
Four years ago, a member of parliament elected 10,000 Czech citizens abroad.
"Since the last update of the announcement in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or there may have been a change in the level of representation," it said.
The declaration contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative authorities to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive voting tickets in the version for the press.
It is their list that is changing with the announcement.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Malaysia's Bamako and Japan's Ky<0xC5><0x8D>ta.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are on the list of embassies in Kenya's Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and Zambia's Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation on the Consulate General in Irbil and Chechnya, the capital of China's S'-Cchuan Province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect MPs in polling stations at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which the candidates are to vote abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 that a decision had been made between the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs were elected abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later, 8222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were sent to the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recalled Racial lynchings
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed around the nearby towns of Monroe, Georgia, and coded towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver was able to get to the bridge, a group of white men with guns parked their way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled out of the cigarette for a long time and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside, the passengers were trembling with fear.
"We want that-- and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence interrupts the roar of a young black man, who is pulled out of the passenger's seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men crosses the "Roger's" neck in turn, the audience breathes with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kuklux Klan.
No one has yet been convicted of murder.
“It’s amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all those years — even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call to action. Every year the Monroe community recalls that justice was not done enough.
“We demand a trial and a closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated.”
On July 27, 1946, a medical examiner covered one of the bodies of a lynching victim at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were expected to attend the lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted so far.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's residents.
In April 1946, by the decision of the Supreme Court, the black citizens of the State of Georgia were granted the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election that Roger Malcom, a black farmer, had to stab the owner of Barnett Hester’s white-skin land during the taping — allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester had studied with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to a different state.
According to an FBI statement, on July 25, 1946, the then-significant owner of the white-skinned land Loy Harrison filed a $600 bail for Malcolm.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and brothers Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects were parked on their way.
“As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison,” the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, which not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
“They always had a clear subtext for all the locals of black skin: ‘this is how you get here if you register and go to vote’.”
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Her performance is visual, engaging, and insightful. She shows a deeply rooted racism that many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
Watching this reconstruction isn’t easy and even harder to turn a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are lurking in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can’t be a relationship between us if you don’t listen to what I had to go through.”
The main rehearsals for this year’s reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest of blacks – entered the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but in his words the role is exhausting.
“I have a bad feeling about it because it’s against who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, including Barnett Hester, train their roles.
The show begins with a plot - Malcolm makes a deal with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n--e!"
Rascona can't.
There's a rift going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," Greene said cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'n--r' in that tone."
"That's right," one of the black actors whispers.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it look like four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word to N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The crack, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings the sad song of Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is a feeling of sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen observers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
In the congregation there is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many of them from nearby.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murder could have been viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is horrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene summons a crowd of observers to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel at the victim's head, watch fake blood and immobile bodies, and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," said the little boy.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene thanks the audience.
The actors clean up the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugha, a man in a suit who played the leader of the Kuklux Klan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two friends-heroes and tears in their arms; in the end, emotions come to him.
"That's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know this role is up to you.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience will meet with the actor for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings from today’s performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those disgusting acts... that people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It forces me to realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “just called police gossip.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he has already started planning the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use read only the silver.
I don't agree, by the way.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often rhyming surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember the days of the past, where the instruction to use anything was rather a rarity.
So maybe my first phonograph contained only one paper, on which there were hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, there were some secret markings on all of them.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that letter to the shaman who was not afraid to screw up the back plate.
He advised me with a hint of what the paper with the labyrinth line is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a broken wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl records again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where just the overgrown grapefruit was sticking, required about ten pictures.
In particular, there was a plan with a description of how to move one part to another.
The set was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it, on the contrary, required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My disapproval of the instruction ended with my self-propelled Seat Leon.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, among which included, among other things, the replacement of the flashlight.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work should be finished.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right was going to be replaced really only in three steps.
1. Separate the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
Third, the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
At first I thought that I would move the right upper limb into the trunk of the car with a spring, a screw to which it can easily be removed, and then I will be guided by points 1-3 of the saving author of the service book.
I think it's a drawer.
This cover had no place, no space, not even for the thin handle of Popel<0xC4><0x8D>ina, that is, the obesian Slezan.
I’ve lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was further reinforced by my wife’s entrance into the garage, which was called by the rook and the words that I heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked helplessly.
My response took about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar term, there are only two published words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she said in a sentence that may be her last in a long-lasting bond.
I slowly explained to her the problem, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture of the author of the instruction, where blessing with burnt iron on the hand that wrote the instruction, then by sealing it, so that he could never write anything again, was simply an introduction to the wide range of the instruction
"How about dismounting the box?" said the woman dismounting the battery.
In pure desperation it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just reading from a collapsing state after checking two of the State Department's Drug Control Officers.
I know him as a balanced colleague, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field, and who can also interpret wild stories with an uninhibited voice.
"Imagine I got a fine for not having a hand-washing manual hanging out," he told me in a weak voice.
I gradually removed the whole problem, which was that above the sink on the patient's toilet there is no picture guide to wash your hands.
His argument by the commission official that adults can wash their hands as a rule, and that the need for pictograms to master the usual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of the settled palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of the chromanoonce, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the bucket.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joyful finding that a man has washed his hands exactly as the S<0xC3><0x9A>KL judge orders him to do.
Finally, I have to state that I have been inspired and prepare a detailed plan for toilet work.
In the case of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of urination, due to a certain difference of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions of two.
The problem remains with those pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure also means a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse a certain squall in the prudent visitor's toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn from his squabbles that he has become accustomed to his life.
Pearson to drop 3,000 more employees and cut dividend in bid to revitalize the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday it would drop an additional 3,000 employees and cut the temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to redeploy 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to revive declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, where one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, officials said.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in the main mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the explosion took place on Tuesday after a security guard, together with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a sub-house built explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagra.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban have signed up for the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already questionable situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of U.S. troops who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has trained in recent weeks, have shaken public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reassessed its decision to distance smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to defer the Obama administration’s law, which ordered states to reduce emissions, just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to introduce the “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it is submitting the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their opinions,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s efforts to distance ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurement, set limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen from most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to curb many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama – according to Trump’s words – in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s effort has launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups, who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r was wounded and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may not have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer has organized a monstrous event in Czech proportions, hosted by such leading figures as Karel Gott, Lucien B<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>, Simono and others.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and to present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the newly appointed person.
But few people already know that the very filming of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and did not go without a regular trap.
Sara’s song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic nature of the scene, in the video, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a blow to the face.
But at one point he hit him so hard and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a morning, I wasn't expecting it, my nose was bleeding right away," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers at the scene said it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
The video of the young artist mentioned is now being brought to you, you can also record in it the scene with a stroke.
An unspecified version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room at ESPN’s Los Angeles offices, while Garcia – the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council – came down into the hall where he welcomed Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka, the World Boxing Organization’s featherweight champion.
After Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, both boxers were on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled up his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
A lot of luck."
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka Egis Klimas adds that the potential clash of boxers would be an "excellent test".
"I'm a former champion in the peer-to-peer league," Garcia adds.
"Because of the game with the Broner (67 kg) I had to collect, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63 pounds.
I would like to go back to the light weight category.
The bat has to come together again to gain weight... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why not do it to them.”
The puppet agrees.
"The box would benefit this match."
Climate raised the demand for payment for consideration - which is part of his strategy. Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko should make his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year fight with Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in Jo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>vez v<0xC3><0xA1>z<0xC3><0xAD>g<0xC4><0x9B>
"The game should be run in a pay-per-view style, fans are asking for," said Garcia, who later expressed that he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the game through a television station that would come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will get that kind of attention.
We are waiting for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka as a "horrible boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko, however, refused to congratulate Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a when he said that the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looks “very slow...sorry Mike, but you’re talking about knockout.”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension in front of each other.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match gets so much attention.
And I'll gladly attach it to the fire," Garcia said.
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match.”
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volhy.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And finally, the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad end of the whole story.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>eboksary in <0xC4><0x8C>uv<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xA1>.
It was only thanks to the documents that remained in the car that the police managed to identify a few.
The documents survived under water for a decade, without which the police would take much longer to ascertain the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
His find was reported to the Cheboksary police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by the frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its conclusion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The latest results from the Swedish asylum-seekers’ tests, which have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as being over 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their lives.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to the investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency ruled that the person questioned was “possibly over 18 years of age”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall only be accessed if the age of the respondent is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson from the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Contrary to last month, the statistics are kept in busy queues and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases, it was found that “the person questioned is 18 years of age or older”.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the respondent stated that he will be 18 this year.
Criticisms have also been found in the medical method of determining age, which includes wisdom tooth X-rays and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-ray surgeons.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person in question passed puberty.
“I had a reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend the opposite,” he told Metro.
The agency's medical agency G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision by saying: "Generally, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the 18-year limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that he would not meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay for a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even if he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This comes from the transcripts of the interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Pena Nieta was non-diplomatically punished for being critical of his plan to build the wall.
The southern neighbor described it as a growing political problem and pressed the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that in the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview and threatened to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
Somehow, the funding will be invented and eventually it will be well received.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to contact you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said.
The wall, however, called it the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important thing.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after the takeover.
Mexico has refused to build and finance the 3,200-kilometer wall, as a result of which relations between the two countries have also deteriorated.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
This conclusion was prompted by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from international facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later he joined it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you've made, but you'll have to stick to it," Trump told Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost murky, for example, when Trump considered it a good idea for an Australian refusal to accept refugees boarding boats.
"You're worse than I am," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation intensified.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they are bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
“They won’t be great people who will go to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In the interview, he also said that the refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world citizens, often even several in one day.
A conversation with Turnbull eventually turned out to be the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before ending it, he said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the killer of Rana before the crowd.
He also looked at her father.
The execution took place on the square in Yemen’s capital Sana’a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi took the girl, took her father's house, raped her, and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then smothered near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has affected the entire country, facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first line of the thousand-headed crowd who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father reported his feelings to the media after the murder.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I've had enough.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were also present, along with the crowd shouting the slogan "let justice live."
The gunman in the square brought a police supply from which he was pulled out.
The police put him on his stomach.
One of the men turned his weapon against him, and from the immediate vicinity set fire to it.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every single morning that was burned.
Mr al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been carried out in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood at the Liberation Square in Sana'a and waited for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into a hateful madness, the killer would fall into the ground and drown.
The execution was ordered by a court that is under the control of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act provoked such a revolt that the judge decided to punish him for death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would have been more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that carried Ranina's body was terrible," he said.
"The wound went away this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the murderous parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
In the morning, she went out to play with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We were looking everywhere, but the wound was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was held and to demand an immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read to the present crowd the record of the investigation in order to calm them down.
The accused, according to all accounts, did not express regret over his act.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read the verdict to him, but the convicted man only looked at his perpetrator for a long time.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but on the Internet there were a lot of recordings taken by the crowd.
The Governor of West Virginia has announced a change of political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at a meeting of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice Governor said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I say that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
The approach of the spectators exploded in joy.
"Tomorrow I'll sign up for the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has previously promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: “The passing of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party that is putting obstacles in our way, rather than contributing to the lifting of our country.”
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least-legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is the last drop for an already-defunct party without a leader who is desperately trying to find a positive and unifying news,” said RBS.
Sebastian Coe hails Russia’s ‘sincere’ apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe hailed Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which was held on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that it was determined to fight doping.
He apologised "to all the athletes who lost the gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think today we witnessed very sincere responses and presentations," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today we have been very successful and we have moved to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia," Coe said.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones,” he said.
At the MS in Athletics, which begins Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have met strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it was allowed back.
Tests on the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board presentation ended.
CzechTrade was acquired by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is in dispute.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was obtained by the publishing house of the Young Front Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savova.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech state is suing Savova for tax fraud and asking him to issue it to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Pro-Export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade signed a public contract to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The order, worth a total of 30.8 million crowns, was obtained by the publishing house of the Young Front entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savova.
The Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are suing him to flee.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The server was alerted to the case of Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award of the contract was to decide from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion has been very helpful to Savo’s company.
According to the information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-criteria of quality.
It was in the result that she moved ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which at the same time offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received an average score of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
In addition, BDO Advisory and R-Media, a digital agency, participated in the tender as well as the Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz server under the publishing house Economia.
The VLM publishing house objected to several objections to the outcome of the tender in that it considers its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their refusal, it was decided to attack the competition with the Office for the Protection of the Economic Competition of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
It is believed that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The designer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of a public contract on the basis of a clear subjective assessment, a clearly favouring participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the designer and other contracting authorities," the contracting authority said.
According to the Director General and Chairman of the Board of the VLM Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>my, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an incredible and one-hundred-percent evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the contestants as unlikely and suspicious," he told Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed itself in the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contracts mentioned by you is published by law in the Contractor’s Profile and in the Public Contracts Gazette.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves on its progress," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, a media representative of the agency, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by stating that it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economy had hit the competition with an article in Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that article.
The fact that it was she who provided the BusinessInfo editorial services in the past four years could help her in the industry.
The contract was first completed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his company, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the United Kingdom for its publication since 2014.
According to Savova, he is the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, under whose influence the publishing house Mafra belongs.
Last year, the London court rejected Savo’s appeal against the issue, but the businessman withdrew.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any understanding from the UK on the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to date," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Prague City Council, told the newspaper.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was a member of Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company that controlled the Czech-Buddhist Samson brewery, and Maraflex, a Cyprus-based company that profiled itself as an investment fund that buys endangered assets.
It is also supposed to control the bankrupt Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legions, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove along the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the dumpsters.
The motorist drew attention to himself by careless driving along the streets, sidewalks and park roads in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovi<0xC4><0x87>.
When the watchman began to chase him, he decided to catch her in the direction of the Station.
"Policemen with increased caution pursued the city when he could not control one of the side roads behind the Marian Spa and took a motorcycle to the field where he had crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to arrive in the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
The police then found out that the motorist did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were removed, his production number was scrapped and the production label itself was removed.
It is so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test was performed on the spot to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman added.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs do not in any way disrupt Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be enforced by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, which introduced UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s move was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Following are several financial conditions for Neymar’s transfer to France.
Because the PSG team is funded by a rich Qatari family that has enriched energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already-starring football family.
Clubs can spend a huge amount on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the managerial costs of the business related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the UEFA director's chair in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that owe themselves to the new forces in the lawsuit ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003—buying a club with potential and spending interest amounts on players and building a global brand—was suddenly not so beneficial.
As part of the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs may lose up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander <0xC4><0x8C>eferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-time payment, it may, for the purposes of accounting, distribute the amount for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing the transfer to be signed at EUR 44.4 million annually for a period of five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million) - which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenue through companies associated with club owners.
Even though the Qatari company is sponsoring PSG once funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be paid by the organizing committee of the MS in 2022 football in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar have denied that Neymat should become the MS ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would easily expose UEFY agents.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to UEFA’s statement on Tuesday, no investigation was initiated into Neymar’s move to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of dresses.
From the signing of the contract, the club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG is violating FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ for both the club and the state,” Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same La Liga stance on funding the club.
“It’s a result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as he becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan backer Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the farm.
The same scene as in the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan reserve moved against the Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The flight team, fueled by new multimillion-dollar forces, ends after the opening doubles match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the incised goal it was necessary to shoot four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we could get away with anything else.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta manage to get that long into the game?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The combination of the opponents was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we shot in half an hour.
Of course, that’s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was already much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it is one of the pain when a new man is formed.
We played only three competitive games and the composition is constantly changing.
It’s about the coach finding the perfect eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging to you that you have already played parts of two matches in a row?
They are still only part of the game.
I myself don’t know how my condition will develop and when I could play at last from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe me, you can't come back.
Sparta somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they went into disarray.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I'm terribly sorry that we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show me something they'll come up for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember a visit like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting each other, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
In the event of an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to be segregated for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tom<0xC3><0xA1>n, who is expected to spend a considerable amount of ten years in prison for cutting taxes.
The estimated damage is 645 million kroner.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice had violated his fundamental rights, the actual findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges identified the complaint as unfounded, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK found from the court database.
The U.S. is no longer a court of appeal.
"As a fourth instance, it cannot assess the factual or legal doubts that are allegedly allowed by the General Court unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution said.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
Verdict has been in power since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in a publishing prison in Argentina, where he was also at the time of the U.S. decision, according to the resolution.
The penalty is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
He served from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis.
The damage of 645 million kroner occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to experts, exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the complaint, the company World Servis did not include in its tax returns all the invoices.
Instead of monthly VAT deductions and consumer taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, the tax was paid in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies that the company was trading with have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radom<0xC3><0xAD>ru Vyb<0xC3><0xAD>ral, whom the court measured for VAT machinations in 13-year-olds in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court ahead of time.
"Summer to the Insurrection" and "Comrade Detective" series play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the famous 80s; both for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State") on MTV; and, of course, also for the modern era, especially in 2001, before the stars like Elizabeth Paul Banks and the project stars, Amruds.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From a French perspective, it looks like someone is breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not only because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with greenery, which H. Jon Benjamin pronounced).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - the middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and were unable to get away from previous events.
The sequel “Ten Years Later,” in which adults play, doesn’t push so much to the emotional level and satire is sporadic, including a parody of 90s thrillers such as “Hand on a Christmas tree.”
At one point, the character finds himself on a pile of Apple Powerbook haraburdas, wheelbarrows, and “slips of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The benevolent Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still did not convey his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a woman.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-placed Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Especially fun is watching the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias character Matt Dillon from the movie Young, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
The franchise could start moments of random madness, such as the recurring series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I predict will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the final scene the whole band will be released for the first time.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War series "So Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons of Eastern and Western wrestling clash.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, directed by Rhyse Thomase, is set to act as a television production: a drama about two Romanian police officers from the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in a way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - held by Gregor and idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who acquired Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective is too focused on a nasty propaganda drama - which includes a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too dizzy and comedic moments are not enough.
At a shorter pace, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in which two fatteners swallow hamburgers stacked on a large crowd.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The ideas of the Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have not been able to cancel the IAAF’s ban on start-ups.
The International Athletics Federation of the IAAF at the Congress in London has confirmed an extension of the international ban on Russian race starters due to the state-sponsored doping program.
Voting in the history of the world championship, which begins on Friday, was very clearly expected.
To extend the ban, 166 delegates spoke out, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is, above all, the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted before Congress by the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban be continued.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and in the country still work trainers with a disgraced reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) is not yet fully operational and does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes coming to Rio de Janeiro to discuss last year’s Olympic Games.
Despite the ban, the upcoming MS will be attended by 19 Russians, who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a longer time.
However, in the championship they will not be able to start in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England to support interest rate of 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a sharp economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has led to speculation of rapid growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite the craving for family budgets.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) political actors voted six to two times to keep the interest rate at 0.25 %, and the results of the vote to increase the interest rate supported a slight economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets will continue. The bank expects inflation to increase to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of Brexit-induced inflation, and also stated that the rent-out of mobility should increase more in the financial markets than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to remove part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from next February onwards, the Plan for Timely Financing should start to pay, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England stated that it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “The MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with the pressure on real household incomes and the burden on consumption.”
On the issue of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to “tighten the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than the markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "permissible" and "limited".
The Bank has reduced its growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 at a value of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing growth buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% from the previous three months.
The high-probability growth will remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although, according to the bank's statement, it should increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is a minor relief for households affected by rising inflation and a poor rise in wages, the Bank said the situation is worsening even before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” revenue cuts in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will “significantly” increase towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the high interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0.025% in August of last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decline in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the complete unification of prices and the economy will last for at least four years.
Prior to the Bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was developing increasing pressure on households, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank stating that it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to 2% of the target was “completely” due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Due to the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only increase as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and re-mortgages – there are no-fee options on the offer, as well as the low rates they get at auction.”
NHS Predicts Controversial HIV Drug for 10,000 Patients
Since September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment based on the decision of the Supreme Court to fund the NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 TB patients in the UK.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported last year’s Supreme Court decision, stating that the NHS has the financial means to reimburse PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, accepted NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
The application PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people, and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic and take care of the potential participation in the testing.
The program will come to taxpayers for <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully address the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It’s another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of the National Aids Trust, said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and does not need to negotiate with a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement with pleasure.’
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one needs to be fast testing across the country; we need to make it available to every patient.
We now have a trial drug PrEP available and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection."
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and suspensions by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will lead us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country and protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on the High Legs: Interlayer and smart design have turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - it is a visual example of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment at Earls Court and it had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him immediately, and on the same day I shoved him.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters of complete renovation has passed.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you have to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage space and an interfloor to make use of the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed design studio based in Notting Hill employed an almost four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that two gaps would be inserted above it - the challenge for the architects was to create an interlayer on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to involve his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on its own - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the hallway, the beautiful living room looks out over the old copper window frame in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror strip in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance doors there are storage areas equipped with mirrors to store cabinets and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
The kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to play out very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of the space and storage spaces, Joanne has acquired an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, what you’re selling is living space — or appreciation of your property,” Erfan said.
"The real estate agent basically calculates its price based on the living area at the entrance to the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining high-quality materials that lend the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t fall in love with electricity distribution in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts don’t win.”
As it turned out, high-quality design and increased living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid for it and declared a law banning the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned the use of state money on the roads of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's going to stop this madness?
“California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles is considered discrimination.
Tennessee, however, passed a law that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again passed laws that religious charities that have given birth to children after birth to adoption, do not have the obligation to provide these children with adoptions to same-sex couples.
Because of these laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens’ travel to eight states of the Union from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have trips to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid off from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
On the roads, they must either obtain federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the roads of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has been patient, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also does not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not like California's travel embargo because of this.
He sees them as retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against each state of the Union, which would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he urged the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's a fact, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is going to go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what’s wrong with the conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell pigs under the penalty of the penalty, when there are enough pig cutters?
In the state of Colorado, a baker faces anti-discrimination and high fines for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave him in the room and not order the relevant cakes from the hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic, domestic policy in non-federal powers according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California, and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California as well!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to be tolerant of their way of life.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of life and let live by which all reasonable people should be guided, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one can ever express a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they must be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the enemies of modern freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have made such concessions on political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case of this was the 1950s, slavery was a political cause, and the war in the North against the South was a turning point.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening, and the United States is mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Criticism of Putin received a gruesome punishment.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court punished him for calling on people to take part in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests over the past two months and announced that he wants to resign as head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin’s chief executive, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was punished for calling people to protest through videos posted on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll get them out of the judge's pay later," he joked on the Kremlin's Twitter account.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of treason.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the judgment in question politically motivated.
The fines of 300 thousand rubles, including 25,000 rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the split opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to protect Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing the forest business Kirovles.
In May, the judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so authoritative, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire by their Italian family, pulling over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis is staying at the Toorak estate, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a dispute over joint property and commercial property up to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly disputed before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna, her brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
It was founded by the Westco Jeans family, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company in excess of $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is a "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns a property worth $316 million, while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
For Paul, the division of assets and financial resources has become a problem.
“Colin’s proposal was in my eyes markedly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a 2015 affidavit before the court.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which Paula, according to his statement, cut off Colin.
Colin resists the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a meaningful solution to the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, are flooding lawyers, including Allana Myers, QC, and attorneys from both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had operated milk bars and milkshakes since the 1950s, and in the 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They bought a property in Collingwood for the money obtained by building the property, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated with $10 million on his departure and Luke with $26 million.
Paul, Luke, and Mark were “not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has since been held back, despite being a former member of the board of directors of the AFL, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add."
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to settle the matter before the court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a statement to the court that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a viable solution."
On Friday, all hope was out of the question.
“Our disputes will be resolved in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Wind in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower with children.
MHD drivers fascinate water and summer clothes.
In the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, she only goes out in the morning.
The <0xC5><0xA0>kolka is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no swimming pool, but teachers are showering children in the foggy area.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and curtains are removed.
The air is trying to cool the clean air because it does not have air conditioning.
This is also very important for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have an open operation," said Miloslav Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the school.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to her the temperature moves about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close and we have the blinds on the south side that we protect ourselves with.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr<0xC3><0xA1>zi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees growing on the ground, so we are under them.
"We have a beautiful nut there, there's a table under it, and we do different things there," school principal Barbora Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Teachers with children try to walk into the forest, where there is a bigger fridge.
Kids get wet hats and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a handheld pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children," Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Also, the director of kindergarten in Novoborsk<0xC3><0xA1> street in Prague’s Proseka Jitka Vilimovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said that the teachers of children are trying to stay in the shade and drip them with water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15:00.
Every child should have a head covering.
Teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
Every day they also have to eat vegetable salads and to eat always fresh fruits and vegetables, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Perhaps today, a mother brought about ten pounds of melon for the children," added Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Drivers are given water or summer unicycles.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer drinks on hot days.
The cabs of drivers tram and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air conditioned in the passenger area.
The high-temperature tramways have not been seriously damaged so far.
A minor injury occurred in a loop in Hostivara.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that the drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Chlorinated drinking water is available in all loops, interchange points and ticket offices," said <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the car washes and at some replacement locations, employees have so-called soda bars, which produce a chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ion-protective drinks.
“They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily commutes,” she added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic liquidated 108, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic rose above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly employed in the fight against fire.
"They are considering fires in the natural environment, and also those that are associated with flax work," firefighter Nicole Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
There was no change in the weather in the evening, when storms and storms were raging in a number of places.
In connection with the firestorms, 236 interventions were carried out.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They were the most involved in the Central Bohemian region," Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> continues.
However, the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> in Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also been attributed to the work of the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, 10 cases of caramel oxide poisoning were carried out by ambulances.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbonated oxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the room frozen.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict President's media diet
Many tried it before him and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The Politico portal said the new chief of staff at the White House plans to restrict the flow of information from President Trump - including reporting in television news - in the hopes of keeping Trump at the level.
Here is part of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly met on the first day of his new job as an employee, he outlined the key problem Trump’s White House is trying to fix: incorrect information that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he must personally approve all information – whether on paper or in a word – because the president can make a better decision based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth for Trump’s control and his media presentation.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back decades – and now that he’s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump was upset as a candidate by honest reporting, it was fitting for him to show that he is being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media that was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets on the back - at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that sing praise to him."
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t know about – that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn’t check them out.
We will never know about the tweets that Trump never sent, most likely.
If his employees managed to keep him on his butt at least a few times, then their efforts did not go out the window.
However, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from inciting controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump’s materials – which can, but may not be reliable – that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published in May a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
Here is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative news from the media, especially to reports of leaks, and seeks to find out where they came from.
The situation came at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — that accused Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a “source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
No matter that Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he has not submitted his claim with any evidence; or that he has already issued false charges in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tried to implement the system to manage and document the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to implement the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness just won’t go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These irreplaceable factors of Kelly's mission are certainly putting a strain on him.
Tourists are discussing a trench and return to the 'Millionaires' Quarter'
Several of the most livable homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again deserting over with determined tourists, who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to reacquire the field for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on a field near a thriving street in the city of Solihull, which is nicknamed the “millionaire’s Quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were shown in May. Neither did the trench, which was excavated on the spot under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their fall.
The group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans with unprotected gaps that served as a way.
The displaced residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull City Council, saying they were “not able to solve the problem.”
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
Last night there were more coming, and today there will be more coming.”
She added that : 'The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I am not allowed to continue to pay taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said: ‘It’s ridiculous. Just recently we’ve been watching the last departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
A spokesman for the Solihull City Board of Directors said: “We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the site near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to address the whole problem in a timely manner.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible report any unsocial or illegal behaviour of the police at number 101.
We'll get the whole picture that we're going to bring to court."
The European Parliament's husband hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded Robert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under the constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight passed without any complications.
R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> reportedly had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said the car hit him, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After the transfer to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the hospitals in Bratislava.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>anské from NOVA.
She didn't want to talk about the incident.

Italians set up to fight rescue ship NGO with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue ships of NGOs that sail to the Italian coast with migrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules regulating their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates for the first year, has refused to comment on the whole matter because of the accusations made by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosoise.
“It is and always will be the number one priority of saving lives, so we’re very sorry that we can’t operate in rescue zones right now,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on all the current charges after gathering all the information and assessing the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying migrants on board the ship, who were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The newly appointed organisation said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" in the case of rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of the new Code of Conduct has also been rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, who are embarking on rescue operations in Italy, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local authorities bear fruit.
“In the last few days we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks to be held this month with the Libyan mayor on the topic of the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Silicone and cellulite came down from the overall!
Hot summer days are absolutely tempting to take on only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parties.
Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everyone else involved with TV Prima, just the brakes, she wrapped her body in a mini-overal.
And just a few regular moves were enough, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also a buttock.
In general, he cut himself in half, and he cut himself so high that he had to adjust it all the time.
There was definitely no need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Sending Text Messages to Commit Suicide to Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, a 20-year-old woman, has been suspended for 15 months from a two-year jail term and then spent five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened with imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and cream blouses, Carter stood at the scene announcing the verdict with tears in her eyes, with her hands torn and eyes pointing toward the ground.
"Her conduct killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judges.
“She ended her life to make it easy for herself.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility," she said.
“She didn’t show any signs.”
Carter’s legal representative, however, said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Justice Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her conduct.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It won’t take a day to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has testified that she is "persecuted" by the awareness that she will never attend her brother's wedding and never be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of a man I’ve seen since I was born is the pain I’ll bear for life,” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person assisting in the suicide of another person. This case therefore establishes a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published that spurred suicide.
“Maybe both of you, jump out of the building or dot, I don’t care,” Carter wrote in a text message sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it Conrad,” and “Just hit the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz stated that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised a lot of questions.
One of the people standing by Carter’s side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, and two years ago, she was acquitted.
Ms Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi to fine-tune up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer, BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes there are "more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is home to BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies have called this decision a download.
European car manufacturers have promoted to a large extent the use of diesel engines in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulation.
Nitrogen oxide, however, that triggers diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles for the installation of gas neutralisation equipment issued by diesel engines, which makes the competitiveness of cars more difficult.
While German automakers are facing careful scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges of smearing powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid errors by Volkswagen, which in an attempt to meet the emission limits installed in its vehicles software that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen representatives have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In Germany last month, former head of thermodynamics at the engine development department at Audi would be arrested.
Zaccheo's former manager Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and therefore does not involve extradition, so he can face a lawsuit in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi took part in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits – thus extending the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi cars in the investigation can have a lasting impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker makes an disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
The man and the girl are dead.
The accident occurred on the Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias TV channel said that before landing, the plane was flying just above the people who were drowning on the beach.
Some people from the beach have reportedly fled to the sea from danger.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane crashed and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom were taken alive from the accident, and the police took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to set up a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic at all finalizable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is undeveloped, although it began to be built as early as 1978.
Even though it is unscheduled, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, Castle Road D11.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months has recently stopped the movement of the Child of the Earth.
We Eastmen get the highway after the pieces, as if they were running out of salads.
They cut the wheel and then we'll only see when and if we get another one.
At the same time, we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite currents of trucks go directly through the city of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or N<0xC3><0xA1>chod, which is not as reasonably object.
But the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, that is, nine years ago, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a touch ever since.
Therefore, when the construction of the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradci Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> started with an archaeological survey that began at the end of this year, you might have sculpted the eastern Bohemian peaks.
After all, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that the building will not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Land Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has given a breakdown.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked the construction permit decision in its entirety.
They shall request a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the County Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Law Office.
So far from D11 we drive near the village with the explicit name Poh<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we drive, we just go down the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and give preference to then fall into the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the republic.
A beautiful, constantly connected road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the essence of the problems of building communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically inexhaustible in the current system?
Read in a new reflex.
Provence's levandule threatens climate change
The levands have become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but are now threatened by climate change.
The lavender disappears as a result of the dry climate and harmful insects, causing a shock to the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and at the bottom.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
They also have cicadas and raccoons that carry micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate.”
There's a lot to bet on.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil that is produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller.”
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The killing of journalists underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce’s staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the unrest in the Sinaloa region, with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and non-violent drug wars.
But today, under the pressure of recent events, it is mainly due to its own security.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, it is enough to use imagination and prejudice.
Choosing them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspicious of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence does not stop and the bodies are held in a mass across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 have been in power since President Enrique Pena Nieta came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal and military protection.
Among them is the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-encompassing - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Justice“, on which the middleman shows, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a t-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a print on it.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects, according to a statement by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, have so far been charged.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and the murders of journalists get to court in such an exceptional way.
Journalists from Riodoca insist that they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; although they are aggrieved and the said territory is currently very treacherous.
“Without information about the killers and without a view of justice, a security meeting is irrelevant,” Ibarra said.
“It’s foolish to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to catch several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, all because of the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunmen then entered his car and shot him near the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacan, rumors are spreading rapidly.
In Valdez's case, however, there is only a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions seek to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa and the cemetery is full of elaborate two-story mausoleums for the drug king, many of which are larger than houses.
For a moment, forget that the word “premier” is thought to be one drug cartel that controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of drugs.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, is still reeling from not protecting his friend.
He believes that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n’s sons.
The peace could anger the sons; the suspected gang members collected all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after taking over other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez has become a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock worth $50 and establish it together with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloa “it was impossible to run a newspaper and not mention the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists were happy to go in search of problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said as he accepted the award.
“Drug trading in Sinaloae is a ‘way of life’,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do with the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
Riodoce's employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and unchosen language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all rely on their daily routines.
He was always wearing his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions – how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you mess with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation occurs.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not playing here, get your hands off it.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "They have a sense that can be ridiculed... and then there's the thing with Javier."
The old rules, he said, no longer apply in Sinaloae, just like in the Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoca employees meet, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of a forty-degree shaft in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were elected by the state to protect the Riodoca office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan neighborhood.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who, according to the government's statement, are corrupt.
It has been several months since the journalists last set out in the hilly areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the programme this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Sinaloa.
They are also charged with suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the office of the State Representative.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were alerted when they were going to write about what every resident in the city knows: that this restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain policy, which is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high places.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n's sons, El Chapo, Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, avoided military intervention.
Even a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly have ruled out the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez’s office turned into a warehouse of cedul<0xC3><0xAD> and a rally to protest against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez seized several cedules and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the office of the State Representative for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n state.
Only a burnt body has been discovered, and the authorities claim that it is Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is graded all over the country. Many of them organize protests and lean on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS Press".
The Bojorquez newspaper's director is on a visit to Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their killings for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "defeated" by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
“You’re going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez added.
Killings obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Mac<0xC3><0xAD>as, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my reports.”
Next to the severed head lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to end activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, which is based at the northern border of Chihuahua state in response to the March murder of the journalist Miroslava Breach.
Others are still continuing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after his director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels in public with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's not an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly stalking you.

Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
The researchers have now revealed the findings of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains—which experts called the ‘Mona Lisa dinosaurs’—found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his slender skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is “the most preserved ever found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by the researchers who described him with the words “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armored bison is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk discovered the rock on March 21, 2011 while drilling down the Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“Just a little bit of eyeballs and you’ll believe he’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly be inscribed in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this beetle — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was most likely facing a serious threat from the masochistic dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts say that it allowed him to better merge with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur Nodosauridae first appeared in the papers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team to carefully uncover the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of rocks and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising, as Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave preference to masking before confrontation when surviving.
Many modern-day animals with masking — such as deer, zebras, or swans — are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosadaurus had to fight for its survivors literally.
“The handover of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur is a visual illustration of the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the peels also revealed that the skin’s dinosaurs probably had a reddish-brown color.
The researchers continue to study the animal and look for other insights into its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to find out its last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea where it sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at the time, the climate was the same as in present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans went much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it’s completely covered in perfectly preserved cracked skin and at the same time it’s preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the call.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; it’s enough to narrow your eyes a little, and it seems like you’re just sleeping.’
During the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, masochists, and dinosaurs, roamed the earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be a favorite asset of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose most recent findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta’s body was plunged into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk discovered the rock on March 21, 2011 while drilling down Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from jaw to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50-cm-long blades protruded from his shoulder.
The researchers believe that this birch tree was blocking the territory of today’s Canada until it ended up in the river that flooded it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after arriving in New York, a St. Louis native sat down on her bed in an Airbnb room and posted on Facebook on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
“The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall posts.
St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his comments about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which he lay in the street uncontrollably, from which no one took him even four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone down to get back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that he was the victim's father and held a cedule in his hand with the inscription "Fergusian police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following the live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead in his hand and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand, pointing at the crowd, shouting, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to and can be called normal.
I felt my skin all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight, and the next day she traveled home.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?” that will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and inviolability told from the point of view of the people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell’s dialogue with her daughter – dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral leader – introduced a topic they had discussed many times before – “about the experience with blacks”.
“Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls in an interview.
"Right now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I didn't think I'd take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... of what has happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow into it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to get rid of them.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who expected police officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the meal.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9th,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis University College, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food into the Black community.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayanov.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
This type of skepticism has penetrated into the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and that’s what we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners throughout death.
He was also involved in the project with Ferrell and six other locals who followed the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
“It was important to me – how these people will be represented – because I will be represented in the same way.”
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about the rescue leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," Folayan said - it turned out that it is she who is most open to participating in filming.
The document Whose Streets? describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
“But I realized that in order to do this job and polish the blacks, I have to open up.”
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of an extreme black woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — who created in response to the 2012 murder of teenage Trayvon Martin on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter — call themselves a freak.
“Black eccentric women in leading positions are ultimately behind maintaining the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black extreme women have to bear the weight of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that “the move is actually supported by black women and a large number of extreme black women.”
He insists, however, that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main character of the document because of his views.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
“It is no coincidence that she felt herself in the front lines, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black wonder woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of the television stations have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on two-and-a-half-year terms for blocking the highway at demonstrations.
Socially, the political atmosphere in the area he calls home has been described as "disorder."
Yet she does not stand in her effort to which she has committed since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters were sent to the scene, and the helicopter also helped.
Near the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, between the towns of Bylan and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burned from 14:00.
The fire ceased to spread around 15:15, the firemen declared the third degree of fire alarm out of the four possible.
According to fire spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, the fire from the air also helped the helicopter to fire.
At 18:00 the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters were fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine compartment of the truck.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six buckets of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed over to the owner until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Similarance: The Artist Creates Portraits Using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from extracts from the oral cavity and hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is called A Becoming Similarance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from office.
Using Manning's algorithmic DNA analysis and 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor, if not an intellectual commentary on DNA subservience, as well as an interpretation of DNA in many ways.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including breaking six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were kept by the prison staff. Only one black-and-white, lower-quality photo escaped from the public, on which Manning, apparently worried, sits on the driver’s seat in a platinum blonde wig, with which she is now connected.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complement the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea with the question of whether she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse were comrade for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea were loved and could attend the show in person.
President Obama actually asked for Manning’s release a few days after the comic was released, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are seeking to publicize government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways in which his tweets should spark a spark in the areas that are under control.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for some reason.”
Under the declaration of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with his huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is punctuated by the heart) after the end of the "self-contained fractionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a stack of letters C, G and A recorded by a pencil.
By adding 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope people will realize that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and anyone can put them out in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 work Spurious Memories is also on the topic of video.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, that’s 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning, a man whose manner is based on the manner of King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win,” it says.
“Never be silent.”
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, my crazy skin jumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition – as was predicted in the comic book – but when it does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomics, classified as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which its genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
“In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the shape of Chelsea and liberates it.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University in search of murder
These days, a nationwide search is underway for a professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University employees who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder arrest warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased had been found on July 27.
Police were alerted by telephone to this fact, and after arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was found dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Police are looking for both suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University for Public Relations, said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was barred from entering the university’s school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
Speaking at the university and Somerville College, he said in an emailed statement: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to report to the police in full.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public contact with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
“The police have information about their whereabouts, and the search for suspects is being stepped up,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to happen in the apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to all residents: “The police are now working on compiling the victim’s timeline and profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Chairman of the Russian Government Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of these criteria, however, calls for the government’s alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes’ doping after the public announcement of the WADA investigation results, which was investigated by Richard McLaren.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we can’t admit to something that never existed.”
Mutka’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the director of Russia’s independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview for Russian RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: "On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without exception," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After a visit to the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “on the right track” to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a juvenile.
Police charged three men with setting up a Wednesday fire at a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inci-Gutech on Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stec.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
As a result of a criminal offence, they face up to 15 years in prison.
Today, the Moravian-Silesian police director Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
He said the police would be dealing with possible arrests of the accused.
Further information, according to the Director, cannot be made public.
“I can’t say more yet, because really, there are criminal police and investigative officers working on things and the state representative who oversees the case,” Kugel said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church began to be rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, other costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also prepared and is counted on the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov<0xC3><0xA1> also destroyed the fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by an electrical failure at the time.
In his place, there was an exact copy.
The state counts with the citizens in defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations that can be used in the defense of the state, with voluntary gun training or with a team of training trainers, the factual intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is taken into account.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of processing it by the government, promises to increase the physical ability of the Czechs and their abilities, which they could then use in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal made by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on defense.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, in addition to the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of volunteerism.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capacities of their members.
In return, he would get information about people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis if needed, and about their abilities or equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors available who would help associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also counts on the organization of words with war veterans or people who behaved heroicly.
One possible variant assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of a state of threat.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of the previously obvious boundaries between the individual types of threats," the statement said, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as wide a range of capabilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base, which will enable each citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent wrongful conduct."
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their height will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns per year.
Other money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that it would have to expand the scope of the regional military command, which would employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Earlier, the representatives of the Ministry said that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on the holding of arms.
Its adoption would allow the shooters, who will be part of the system, to keep some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised the anonymity of the investigation, some employees expressed their distrust of the whole process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, an e-commerce company owner at San Francisco-based Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from the outside.
New start-ups in the human resources sector are constantly emerging on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention of measuring employee obligations, startups allow companies to carry out rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offer complete anonymity of employees and hotline of employees for filing complaints, complaints and complaints.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that she gained more awareness of what her employees think and how they feel in three years thanks to Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a casual overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings – allowing users to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case of becoming another Uber - which is thrown into scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment, the devolution and the devolution
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and expose inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent’s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken over its wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline, which allows employees to report inappropriate behaviors.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Administrative Board.
“The court of public opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If the company is found to be behaving improperly with its employees or behaving unethically — and not in violation of the regulators — it can face costly consequences as a result of a customer boycott, exhaustion of employees or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to track down a phone number or email at the company’s management, officially file a complaint, and hope for a decent solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who said there had previously been no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now, when a company uses Convertent, quick detection and resolution of problems that have never before been achieved by managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints – for example, discrimination, harassment or injustice – is ensured.
“It’s close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation on the part of employees.”
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation at a low weight in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s downfall in the abuse of employee ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “you lit up the whole thing on social media,” that companies began to realize that in the online world they can’t simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before people began to use technology to monitor the ethics of technology, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent selected a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually took away $47 million in capital.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing number of researches clearly confirm that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are welcomed and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, who uses Convergence.
Investors make money if companies succeed and companies thrive if the satisfaction of its employees is there.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market that will ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no wonder that a lot of investors will find themselves supporting this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is purposeless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as a company requests a feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and employee disinterest.
“As soon as you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has been a witness to many companies that rely too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you get things done, employees start asking themselves the question: ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?’”
Madison Reed, a company that now regularly conducts an employee survey every month, is able to solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long run, it will achieve a high level of employment in the field that is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t insist on creating a transparent working environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“As soon as you start losing your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the influx of customers, the whole company is failing."
Thursday has become the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra mainly affected Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, they were surpassed or equalized records at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps in the Guardian, today’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1> today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees, and in Pogo<0xC5><0x99>elice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as that of the Guardian, came in 2013.
Today, high temperatures have emerged mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard there was the largest bucket in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where the mercury flowed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not exceeded.
In contrast, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, for example, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A> website, the temperature so far was only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures there began to grow until this late afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade and more significant rain could come on Sunday.
However, in most places of Moravia high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia even on Saturday.
We've got a mess like this here.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same vote in elections as for every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own a state, they buy political parties.
Penty owner Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>k Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his side.
The convicted corrupter and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took over the Party of the Private.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> did not want to name the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter for itself.
The mayors have also recently arrested their billionaires.
It is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, owner of Jablotron security equipment.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
However, the entrance to the Old Town jersey was not very successful for Grandfather.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is for the YES movement to win 20 percent of the Mayor's vote.
Leckdo smiled.
However, the grandfather's override is rather obvious.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of solid opinions.
Although he intends to vote for the voters in the Mayors’ jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The grandfather supported Babi<0xC5><0xA1> in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a sharp speaker and does not master the favorite rhetoric of political violence," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he definitely doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
For me, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his control world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after being introduced by the Elders as a new force, he resigned from his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to imagine a possible collaboration with Babi.
Some may appreciate that the Grandfather does not change his mind and stands behind his own regardless of what kind of suit he is wearing.
Others may speculate as to whether Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is sending the Mayors to build his own wand for someone so unsightly.
Others may wonder if Jablotron's boss, perhaps with Agrofert's boss, has not been born into a bad trade and is looking for another way to defend his business rival.
D<0xC4><0x9B>dkov’s first public performance, however, did not just revolve around Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they say they need more money, they send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult to stop someone from making such a statement.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakal, a well-known gauner, threw millions at all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, TOP 09 and the civil democrats came together for almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
By the time the Grandfather entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Then maybe he doesn’t have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
In his first days in politics, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek then crowned the proposal for the tax benefit of families with studied children.
People with higher education will come to us about fifty thousand a month.
The ones with a base of less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in this ratio.
The one with the 20's poor.
In D<0xC4><0x9B>dkov’s vision of the society of the poor, taxes are fair and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state, on which they do not share too much.
In short, the rich need to be helped so that they do not suffer poverty with distress.
The elders can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will have many hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not worthy people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the state do not have their own property for their employees and the country.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it won’t help him even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
Reported tom web Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says about the plot: "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even a real-life partnership with the U.S. president did not advocate an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to cut the price of his Caribbean seat by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price dropped to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
A charming 5-acre residence on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also features a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of poles are planted on the ground.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of the property on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With a new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to finish two trainings a day. For the Bruins there are long days ahead
Eleven in the morning are approaching, and players of UCLA’s American football are sniffing at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them dress up their shirts and reveal a slow back, a non-flattering sign of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of non-working complements a half-hour break.
Players enrolling in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will take place the next morning at 6:30.
"These guys will be a good macaque for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's overtime on Tuesday.
With the elimination of two trainings in one day, the NCAA wants to ease players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why the first three UCLA workouts are scheduled at 19:15 – to get stuck in the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week before last year and the trainings are limited during the summer semester. It is also the decision to limit the number of training days from one to two.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled to take place by August 20, beginning formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the NCAA’s decision, despite adding another item to the already-charged players’ diary.
"Three or four days are players under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when you look at the clear line of surrounding grounds from the nearby parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel that occupied players after collecting the protective net behind the gate bar.
Bruins players should be able to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not ruled out that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
They do business well with such material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be protected, as will the parking lot No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I'm sure everything's gonna be all right.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans more in-depth fact-checking to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight the so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed news affected last year’s election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is on the whole. French voters are flooded with a plethora of fake news about the May presidential election and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections, if it does not hurry quickly.
Facebook said in a statement on Thursday that it was going to launch a new fake message check feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” said Sara Su, product manager at Facebook.
She added that Facebook continues to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle recently played a leading role in Squeeze's music video and found its refuge in Margaret Thatcher during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in Kent, England, which inspired York County's messy Jamie Rhodes - a well-known pastime in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The look on the letter of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was impressed by the fingerprints on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for Jacobity," he said.
"That's the fingerprint of him!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time you had to light a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council of England and the possibility of living on the castle almost four months as a dream. (“To tell the truth, I’ve extended my stay a bit.”)
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been dug up in the trench for centuries.
He walked around the land and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to the beggars, gardeners, and sometimes also to artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the evening he drank whiskey and a psalter.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes had described, as if "the aristocrats of many centuries were shaking hands with the words: 'Put it in the attic'."
Newspapers, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "Perhaps you think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were overdrafting the birch.
Leave it to the people!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and go deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion on the castle in 1380, which was named in the book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it’s related in the end.”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a stone coffin (which occurred only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is the Darrells: “I was captivated by the male generation – the men of that time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The various generations of the Darrell family dealt with it by taking rich or old pancakes – I imagine it was the handsome gentlemen who liked to shake their heads at the heirs.”
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, which is a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
This is a very special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
“I said to myself, ‘Now let me go back to real life.’”
Washington changes the terms of green card allocation
The media has released the words of President Donald Trump about the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change when granting a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to drop by 50,000 per year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the people of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
"The new application process is a priority for English-speaking applicants who are inundated with financial resources and demonstrate the capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said in a statement.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the alert
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Yeah.
These days, sex robots are very popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aids are transformed from an inflatable pan to a robotic woman with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, it is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "correct" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own “personality” that would also embarrass the Stepford panic.
Modern inflatable ladies have developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement woman different character traits, including shyness.
And then there's Roxxxy Gold's sexual robotic woman from True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "good" nature.
“The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to match your personality to the maximum extent possible,” the company’s True Companion website says.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
It's even moody, just like people.
It can be tired, talkative, or “in a mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons - among which there is no exchange for real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are rather subordinate female character traits and violent cues - e.g. frigid (reads defamatory) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a departure from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for submissive sex with an optional attachment.
Most men, of course, don’t buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of the public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until they are given a free market to do so.
It is not by chance that these sophisticated sex robots emerge at a time when women all over the world are exercising their rights and the White House is sitting with a president who is often very mad at a woman’s address.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The Story of the Maid is not what we see - hanging bodies and glazed eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The servant's story represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should, as far as possible, resemble real women (although with the rates of porn).
Their creators construct them in such a way that they are pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
However, when their "personality" occurs, the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history, nothing that would incite their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st century says: service.
NBA star on the green belt.
Curry's fighting a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry didn’t lose out on a professional golfer’s first start despite a packed first burn.
Double-time NBA player award holder played in the Ellie Mae Classic tournament of the lower series Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, first round on 74 runs and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State player, who won a second NBA title with the Warriors this season, began very nervously and his first break ended in a drink holder in a golf cart parked near Fairway.
Even then, he wasn’t as precise between the holes as under a basketball basket, yet he left behind with a balance of four wounds above the pair of ten professionals.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, I had to call the referee right after the first fire, but then it sat down a little bit," Curry said, with a huge tremor falling on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot at the tournament, but that was all I had hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight the cut, which is likely to be set to two hits under the pair, he becomes the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time, and now that I’ve got rid of the treble, it’s probably going to work,” said an enthusiastic golfer who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
A sure sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, micro-scale, also disrupt entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the U.S. newspapers were hampered by advice on how to deal with relatives who choose Trump.
All we're supposed to do is wait for the nerves to let us.
Less attention, however, is paid to Trump’s ability to shape the family.
I’m talking about it because my cousin, a poet and leftist fan, who lives in Chicago and has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the clumsiness of the face in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family — including all the Republican siblings she's had years of politics with — is on the same wavelength.
At dinner at the family table, it’s a good thing; but it amazes me that, in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all out of the way.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his chessboards may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrifying long-term scenario in which Trump is “normalizing” right-wing Republicans who, by defying his standards, will suddenly become the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of a crazy act - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% of the income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like overkill in comparison to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it is enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest tour run by the New York Parks Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central roller is covered with scolaminate - clowns and animals are shooting and in horror looking at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy look and the zinc music of the coupod is reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon fade: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama will shake, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get to your imagination.
Fifty years later, I still didn’t get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually Swiss cheese – it doesn’t count the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage thematic pub – but a London metro station.
However, the circuit in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have great fun on it.
If I could evaluate the walker, it would be worth a maximum of points, but fortunately, no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street, it’s the same, with the difference that I can come up with a 15% discount for something I buy at the counter.
Not only will it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waiter is thus forced to sneak into the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I unwittingly assessed my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This was the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for severe wrist injuries, which, according to the prisoner's statement, he caused himself after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original verdict for murder.
In the early morning hours of Valentine’s Day in 2013, he killed his girlfriend Steenkamp with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have connected her with a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which, according to them, is too mild.
The National Prosecution Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
In case of success, Pistorius is threatened with a penalty extension of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity a bred panda, which glowed in the wild.
The pand rescue program is a huge success.
The centre is trying to expand the genofond pand held in captivity.
A staff member of the Chang Chang Chang Center told the New China Agency that pand breeding is at high risk from a family crossing.
At the end of last year, only 471 people were incarcerated.
In the wild, only two thousand have survived.
Efforts to let the captured pandas get caught with the savages are thus the first step in helping the farm panda to protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-Cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandemic mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of her.
She met her chosen one, Cchao-Cchao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the panda took a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because pandas are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males have a relatively poor estimate of the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, due to the fact that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by the Sithonian police in the morning hours of August 1.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict penalties on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be held throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The game is in fifth place after the first round of the British Open.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands release millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) said it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, meaning that 80 percent of eggs on the market are non-toxic.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs that can be identified by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also joined to close the farms, have not recently ventured into the Czech Republic.
Veterinarians, however, will take samples of scrambled eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in which the problem brands of insecticide have appeared in their markets.
Eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-bleaching, anti-wrinkle, anti-wrinkle and anti-wrinkle products.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says Golman Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and looks for engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said the 27-year-old Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zlin jersey.
It depends on whether he gets involved before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to rate it as in school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t have a lot of desire, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started to catch.
Before the third season, I thought they were giving me more room.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I traded again.
Last year, I assumed I was going to catch it all the time.
But in the opening ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started to spin.
At the end of the day, my friend caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to keep him for the next season.
What was life like in Rize?
Gorgeous.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, next year we're going to get married.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the void.
The less they shoot, and even if they have a half-empty door in front of them, they'd rather record.
In the Czech Republic, they are shooting more.
Did you have a problem with traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done so that you play four matches outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn’t work, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinama’s performance in the KHL help Latvia almost make it to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since its inception.
And since then, their results at the World Cup have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter-finals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an unreal result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Roberts Bukarts sat down and before the signing of the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
How come there's so many of them coming here?
They're not any Viennese players, they're really good quality.
Here teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still uncommitted?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Rize.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because we didn't have a budget for the goalie, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the end they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'm waiting for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I have been at home for some time.
I've picked up something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How real is the variant that you are going to start the new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it's going to go.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't the season I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The coup d'état continues.
In January of this year, I am in the article S care of a proper employer? he wrote about, among other things, the camp in Lety near Orl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remind you of the main passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is about, it will probably be best if they look at the official website of the cultural monument Pietn<0xC3><0xAD> mesto Leta.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, it is learned that the camp was located two kilometres east of Leta village, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labour camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collecting camp, and from 2 August 1942 it became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, caused by human beings again and thrown away ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is no dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the site of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 70s of the 20th century it was built in the vicinity and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered by chance in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was discovered in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and crush pork, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the conflict.
So very briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Only in the autumn did the government approve the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert judgment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy pork.
According to Herman, “there are some numbers, but I would probably dream of those intentions if I went public with them.”
We'll see what the expert judgment brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can go for hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Just like that, it won't be a cheap affair at all.
And at the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the UN Human Rights Committee had financed the entire transaction beautifully, which is apparently not a threat, I think it would have been a waste of money.
Does the government have no other priorities?
The monument, a worthy place of mourning, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wants to, the monuments of the suffering and the murdered can be venerated here.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the sledging place with maximum care.
The responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should take care of the entrusted property, i.e. the money of the taxpayers.
At least in the same way as in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still perceive from the perspective of the above facts the slogan of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year in May, I went to look directly at the place.
Very decent access road, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own sandy site, which is created from stones placed in a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, how it fits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to preserve part of the open foundations and to make them accessible at least visually in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could exert his efforts.
If he succeeds in prosecuting the government to buy back pork for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the exact opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, lead author of the study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the muscles of the vagina tend to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that support the tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the creation of cells in the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one type of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turned out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately from the cells.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and molds that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse gut was tested by DNA sorting and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome - so this type of immune cells did not develop - were given the bacterium L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers bred L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid — without bacteria — to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octaic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the distribution of tryptophan doses, at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us retain the bacterium L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing Neman Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his move to Manchester United as ‘genius’
Manchester United have won their "genius" team in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> - at least José Mourinho thinks so after the goalkeeper made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40 million contract, made his debut in the first match with a 2–1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and played as a backup alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not take the form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, is necessary to work on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and he has a brilliant mindset - he's thinking football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindel<0xC3><0xB6>f and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleven for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club did a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me.”
The Life Challenge of the King of Chickenskins by L<0xC3><0xA1>di Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He wants lessons from Pohlreich!
This versatile image began to be drawn thanks to the new series on TV Prima Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Academy.
The poor man immediately took a chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to apply for this to your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of them have been at the top for a few years, La<0xC3><0xB0>a hasn't forgotten to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you a snooze from dieting chicken, American cucumbers or invite you to the water and show you why it's a favorite fried cheese," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said.
His participation in Pohlreich’s new show is really serious.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is what to do with the boss," Bleska said.
Pohlreich did not express himself, however, because he filmed new parts of his next show Yes, boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes off the television.
In December 2004, Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka Pohlreich hit his first cook.
In a few days, more than 300,000 pieces were sold!
The new event, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcast schedule, is an unfazed cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from a number of spectators and in twelve works he is acquainted with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now cooks the boss in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k let his t-shirt on the back of his shirt burn a crossed pear.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just smiling over that pears - pears are healthy fruits and have a lot of vitamins," La<0xC3><0xB0>a said.
He thinks of Lad<0xC3><0xAD>a’s culinary art.
"Driving according to L<0xC3><0xA1>di Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka is not considered either at home, because at home I do not leave a gastropunk," he says.
I really appreciate Pohlreich's zucchini, and he says I'm even making chicken on honey.
In my order, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka did not forgive himself.
It's stupid!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or a fool," Pohlreich said of Hru<0xC5><0xA1>kov in one lecture.
"I'm not in my twenties to be able to wave my hands over them, but I don't solve them anymore," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. By simply waving his hand, he can open the door from the house and office and even start a car.
Thirteen-year-old Steven Northam has had a small chip implanted between his finger and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
The procedure for implantation and follow-up is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam company also offers a door and car lock exchange service compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of a child has let the technology integrate into his home and car of the BMW Z4 brand, which starts with a simple handshake.
White House Requisition Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of a celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry that took place last month came to $24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME’s weekly.
The Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of a July 17 program at the White House that was a preview of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials have been watching the product previews from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an “extraordinary” event, the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX) said.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” HMX-1 commander-in-chief wrote in an email to his commanding officer, the Navy’s chief of staff, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the screening, the start of which is scheduled to be at 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site, which was scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there is a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulation.
The original crew stayed on the spot that evening with the helicopter and with them also a unit of security personnel.
It was not clear from the records - obtained by the TIME weekly - whether the second crew was sent in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits state officials from using government assets for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were sure that everything was okay,” he wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," the commander's representative wrote.
This “Made in America” screening was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not be held against it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the president pursued a health reform that was going through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government regulation at bay.
The use of air transport such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was flying in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is plagued by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ screening, which featured products from all 50 states that Americans produce from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn and train any flights with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America tour was part of the current crew training, the official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew into the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House said that no other props were played out of taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky said that the company was in no way interested in the negotiations for a helicopter exhibition at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the screening are difficult to determine, according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD expenditure compensation for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate the time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
“Introducing the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for expense compensation is very misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD costs do not include staff costs, but include fuel prices, maintenance, and contractual costs.
Sean Spicer, then White House press secretary, defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of screening.
“The idea of the screening that takes place this week is to introduce products made in the United States,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities in which countless U.S. citizens are involved.
This fact should be remembered.”
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his South Lawn patrol, and it is certain that he was sitting behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump called a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own just three."
A young woman was trapped in a pond near Lake M<0xC3><0xA1>cho, and police rushed to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask for help from a police officer on her mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," police spokesman Ivan Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
There were several police guards at the scene, which she described, but it was not easy to find a young woman.
“Some of the policemen had to be wet with carcinogens hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground under their feet again,” Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
And it was the same thing that was lost.
The police were guided by the direction in which her call for help came from.
"In order not to at least come across this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," she said.
Police found the woman at three-quarters of five in the barracks in Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the edge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of chills.
That's why she was taken to the Czecho-Lithuanian hospital by the ambulance.
Grandfather's connection to Stan?
From the requested bride, she becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project searchmeslusny.cz as a billionaire, he basically told voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also concluded that politically he does not associate a party of lesser-known concerns with independents, in fact he does not have a nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandfather, regardless of political opinion.
This was the beginning of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, and it didn’t work out very well.
With his hon on decent people and personalities, which may also replace some mayors on the candidates, which is what Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k also admitted, in addition, Grandpa also breaks the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is just political scrutiny and experience of the politicians and the politicians of the nobility, the traditional.
They are now quietly replacing the rapidly-collected unknowns.
A total break with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN suspected of identity only then, after the arrival of the Grandfather, only the game of identity ends.
Not only did Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k stand against Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> for a long time, but on the first joint press, Grandfather, who is publicly praising Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated: "My goal is for the YES movement, that is, the Mayor's movement to win two percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope you didn't confuse the movement.
The grandfather is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, Stan has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make a sales girl even more of a wanted bride.
For some time Stan went with the TOP 09, then with the people and now he's looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police Dogs Trained in Bridge Overflights by Helicopter
Dogs specializing in search of explosives and search dogs today trained at Lake Bridge overflight by helicopter.
The police dog should not be fearful and afraid of flying, said Petr Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek, chief of police cynologists in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge, both the adult training dogs and those who are just going through the training.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to reveal sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that immediately, as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the way of the helicopter.
"The helicopter arrives, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog who is restless or is unable to work immediately after a helicopter trip is expelled from the training.
"For the most part, they leave them in the garden," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
Police have 76 dogs with different specialisations in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
They are dominated by German sheepdogs, but also by Belgian sheepdogs.
The poem takes care of him from the puppy.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal any possible medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and carefree, the first test is done in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to make a sharp impact," added Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The length of service at the police station depends on the health of the dog.
It is usually used for 8 to 10 years.
Most of the time, they live with their dogs.
Trailer for season 3 Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series does not end far away.
The confirmation by the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth seasons - the first named has already reached the first trailer and the origin of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA will focus on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential ombudsmen, they operate "as a Fortune 500 company", only with the difference that they stage violent acts and pay more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.

The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of the society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission, said that elections to local representatives are attended by hundreds of women, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if women, as well as all related processes related to elections, are involved in them.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which moves international combat activity to the second place.
In this year’s election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government hands over its power to a peaceful successor government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women.
A unique brewer is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in a freshly brewed brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back to life a brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>i u M<0xC5><0xA1>ena a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the 19th century it was converted into a steam engine.
It was followed by years of flowering, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was halted and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have been used by the state ship.
The destruction was carried out by the brewers after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building material.
In 2007, however, new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jany and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They devoted themselves carefully and devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as it did in the nineteenth century, when it launched its golden era.
Their work was rewarded by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was renewed.
If you want to taste great lobe beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>nska, visit the cellar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use coconut water springing in the protected landscape, sweets from lobe<0xC4><0x8D>sk<0xC3><0xBD> fields and goat’s hops.
You can enjoy a traditional light-bed, but also dark beers and specials.
And don’t miss a visit to the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past midnight.
The largest artillery shell in the Czechoslovak Republic?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>, at the top of the hill above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was supposed to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground.
There should have been a command, a barracks, ammunition warehouses, material, power plant, machinery and hospital.
However, the Munich Agreement was terminated.
In less than a year, a single large concrete bunker was built, and underground areas were looted.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who started reconstructing the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see here.
Soil is already available from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 pedestrian slope with exposure and underground, the area is also equipped with an object of light reinforcement, as well as two disassembled pedestrian slope, trekking and a science trail called Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and stunning views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building is listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Port of Traian near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a powerful four-winged convention building above a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately, belongs to the unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
However, the enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of Dinner for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where will perform i.e. Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k, Ivan Hlas, you will see a smirk performance and you will look at the places of wonderful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Recognize the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet will help students with the creation of herbs and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they just encountered on the walk, this application will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is about.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by the representative of the Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the project The Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
“Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest,” said project coordinator Ivana Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which then assigns it to the photograph in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project Secret Life of the city.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is useful and then add it to the database," Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The departments require assurance from the managers of McVitie's dryer manufacturer about a long-term manufacturing commitment at the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Trade Union (GMB) has stated that the company is currently silent on any investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the departments will be "among the first to be informed" in case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB said it was concerned that McVitie's "will not receive its promises to finance and modernize production lines."
GMB CEO Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building company regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Worked here for generations of many families and employees come mostly from the local community and area of Glasgow, where work in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “The construction company Tollcross received a letter from the GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment towards the employees and representatives of the departments.
A regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and operational efficiency.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality, and in case of any changes in the operation of the factory, the employees and representatives of the departments will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to be sidelined after <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, i.e. the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of their record entry three years ago?
Ligue 1 is set to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby’s transfer to Manchester United, which paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
After the confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and at the same time the world’s best-paid professional athlete – after tax, PSG will collect over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from the team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar withdrew from his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to please Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in beating one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely call one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
It seems that Barcelona crossed the imaginary border when in the summer expressed interest in PSG goalkeeper Marc Verratti.
PSG has made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances will it allow the departure of the Italian representative. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now taking a bitter pill with Neymar for its hefty negotiations.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump has called for anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And even a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it will not continue to do so.
Even from that purer idea of sanctions like straw from a shoe.
These things can't be put in one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela really set out on a path to dictatorship, albeit totalitarianism.
China just doesn’t act as the U.S. president would like.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what it is, and what system of rules the sanctions policy is based on, that task would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only touches on what President Obama has already done, he has only given the executive stamp.
So why such an outburst?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the U.S. election, we will cover up Putin and call off sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Prime Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions are in violation of international law.
Is it like basketball is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But they are not the EU’s anti-Russian sanctions.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
A regular voter taps.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfillment of the Minsk agreements on the truce in Ukraine.
Now we know that it is the EU’s energy security.
The dial is tapered and wider.
Russia is being punished for over-mounting where it doesn’t have.
China is being pushed because it is being assembled little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship on the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules, or the rules?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I don't think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are already ready.
In his words, he didn’t take any significant part in it.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian Heitman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondr<0xC3><0xA1>k.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a heitman," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> said.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have been outraged by your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Is that what you mean?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we directly elect the President, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about the interference of representatives, they can be there quietly.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I dream about when I happen to sleep, I heard in my own ear that you were talking about the cancellation of representatives.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor reckons she's building little and hasn't prepared big projects, but she doesn't have the skills to do that.
The same goes for the government that only two people in our history have ruled, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
But the current prime minister does not manage anything, he only moderates the debate.
So it can't work.
Is that why you want to install a majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-way election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a shifting mandate of ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, from being shown at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, control the House with 101 MPs, abolish the regions and the Senate, and control the entire country through grateful care and mayors.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members of Parliament.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there are 57,000 French in one legislature, while we have 17,000 Czechs.
Macron, however, does not accuse anyone of endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making some dramatic changes.
For those who have a parliamentary majority, however, they are big enough to look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger of this in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did I get voted over and added 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step into that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave unselfishly, quarrel with the government with travel agencies, and for state money they would like to do business like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers do not argue in the government, disagreements are to be expressed outside it.
The cabinet has to go finished material, there is no room for coalition splits, force voting and cheap, there is to be decided.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers behave primarily in a partisan manner?
Above the parties is a constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty did not apply, and expelled Babi<0xC5><0xA1> from the government.
Every prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has managerial skills, a similar plan gesture is not needed.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would recommend to the finance minister?
I'm not thinking about it at all, I don't think we'll be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There's not that many skeptics out there.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur D<0xC4><0x9B>dka, who would like to cooperate with you, with the people may win the wing of the beloved Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
I don't think so.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus ml., who will not oppose the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President of the ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamurians are considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta for the VV, then he got money from the <0xC3><0x9A>svita for his company, some coup took place there.
He is, of course, a prominent figure.
She's kind of bored, though.
If I take his program, then there he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if there is an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with weaknesses and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what is the silent support of the Communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to run, Prime Minister Sobotka had everything to avoid, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's also why he threw me out.
Once he did so, the Czech government was in control of the Czech Republic.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by the management of the Czech Republic, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the Czech General Assembly.
If you became prime minister, would you change the personnel ratios in the supervisory board and change the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus, if I'm prime minister, you'll see.
I'm not one of them yet.
It's a shame that the Czechs have already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for even better with the ANO.
Maybe after the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a humble lobbyist or a rose, I'm a separate unit, and I don't solve this at all.
So answer it directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the leadership of the Czech Republic, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Office, the institutions you criticize?
I want the Czech Republic to be a transparent society.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, and I'm doing it for the traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look into Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has a Czech majority, he never managed it, he was there only in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, evaluate them, strategize them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent campaign against me, but I don’t and I won’t have any competence to throw someone out.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public broadcasting and television fees about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
However, the Chamber approves the report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the Director-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
See how the news is being discussed on the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission for the leaks from the investigation files and to the lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalouska push me to throw me out of the government, which saved the top 09 percent, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about endangering democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of the ANO Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek builds a power reserve by reaching his son to the Supervisory Board of Tepl<0xC3><0xA1>ren Brno and arranging contracts with the city and state companies to associate lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've read it several times.
Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that the lawyer in question works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, Kratochvilova, B<0xC5><0x99>ezin.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
