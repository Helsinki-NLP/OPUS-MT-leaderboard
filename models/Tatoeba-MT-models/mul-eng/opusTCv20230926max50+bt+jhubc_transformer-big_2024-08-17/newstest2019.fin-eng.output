Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane home win at opening - second win for Savo Volley
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who had been to the Men's Volleyball Championship for seven consecutive times, started the 2018-19 home run when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the 22nd most effective hurricane.
There were some recordings abroad, but they did not take place, and then came a call from Loima.
The time was quickly agreed upon, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen also played in Loimu for Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the country team striker Samuli Kaislasalo, who played 17 points in a match-specific agreement.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the opposite side, and it brought additional extras to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the gauge is of course the goal, Kouki said.
The Most Effective Savo Volley
Miro M<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>tt<0xC3><0xA4>nen was at 18 points most effective at Savo Volley, when the team fell by Vierem<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was tempting, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately we got a compressed win.
At least I didn’t have any known different downloads when I played against my team anymore,” M<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>tt<0xC3><0xA4>nen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career at Vierem<0xC3><0xA4>n Lentoballo in the 2000–01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the roof all the time.
There was a good reason to stay home.
Miro was a scoundrel, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of the bridge in the league was 2006-07, when he won the silver at Pielaveden Sammos while Tuovisen was also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful at 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league’s points in the 2012-13 season, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after dropping Kokkola Tiikeri 3-2.
The season has started very well on its own.
Today was a close loss, as we were fourth in a 17-21 loss.
There was some misdemeanour, and the fifth piece came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the Tigers, who were still in the finals, was the 28-pointer Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudryashov supported by 17 points.
I didn't get anything to take a friend's hooker, Mikkonen said.
Finland is one of the world’s leading banks in human capital comparison
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was one of the statistics.
In 2016, the peak index was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was placed on one of the higher ones and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health is considered.
The World Bank has aligned itself with economic growth in the context of human capital.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois took control of Atletico, the local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois took on a brilliant knockout, and the local match of the Madrid teams ended in a draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goals scored, but the Belgian goalkeeper Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played at Atleticos three times on loan while being a Chelsea player.
In the opening week, the International Football Association (IFA) selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real Madrid, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot went past the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale stayed in exchange for more travel.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Real supporters chanted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a painter who moved to Juventus.
In the United States is now being attacked against the right to abortion - a powerful document tells why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump’s nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive vote against Roe could overturn a decision known as Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various support from most of our country's national representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has become the only doctor to have abortions in the state of Missouri due to law enforcement.
The armed guard of the clinic says he defends the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos are reminiscent of killings at clinics.
Let’s move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
The Lutheran Association of Bishops then gave guidance to women’s trusted abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor in question are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There have been deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortions was particularly advocated by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, the California Abortion Law Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
It was later that Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, began to reversibly confuse religion with politics in order to deceive voters.
His abortion bill also revolved around his successor George Bush's older brother.
Donald Trump did the same.
At the very heart of the matter, the document lays the foundation for the politicization of abortion.
When non-taxation was avoided by religious organizations that favour racial discrimination, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a good horse.
Religion has brought exceptional strands to politics.
In writing this, the United States is in a situation in which, with its racial aggravation, the voices of religious right-wing extremists on their abortion trail, the president has elected Kavanaugh as the highest-ranking candidate, which many women now accuse of sexual assault.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations on the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year, when Israel has opened fire on protesters in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of those, 89 were injured.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made a demonstration in the border area when protesters threw Israeli troops on rocks and explosives.
The army says it has started using force to prevent protesters from dispersing the border fence or targeting the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN human rights authority, 12,000 people have been injured.
Protesters demanded Palestinian families have access to areas from which Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one of the Israeli soldiers.
Explosives from lions sent from Palestine and helium balloons have set fire to forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki gets a penalty kick - did not get to shoot himself
Wigan's top mate, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have dropped him back on a fire in the penalty area.
The hero Gavin Ward gave the game a go.
According to his interpretation, the void was clean.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation seemed to be hampered by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to death in the 85th minute when Pukki was dropped.
Ward showed a penalty kick, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the World Series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish chest.
It tastes like Puki again.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created the conditions and defended them tirelessly.
The match for Norwich was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the League Cup.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Those who are sexually interested in children or young people have so far had a hard time getting help.
The Joint SeriE Project of the Foundation for Criminal Care and Sexpo educates professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, the Sexpo offering advice and therapy began to e-mail and the meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are allowed to be released in the autumn.
A child’s sexual preference is a shame to many.
Most of those who have seen pedophile emotions in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus have done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that annoy and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says the sex therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
I think it's a worthwhile job if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound suddenly strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the award based on betting reports.
Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament at least at the level of speech.
The biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming up between Koreas is significant, as last year's relations were good.
Yet, years of nuclear weapons threatening and rewarding Kim, who leads the country with an iron fist, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Peace Prizes will be announced on Monday, and on Friday is the most noteworthy, the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those involved in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass violence and has risen to become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has focused his work on sexual violence, which is a crippling byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered a United Nations refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has reported that this year there are 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn’t hurt if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, the reporter asked him at the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone agrees, but I would never say it myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want this done.
The award I want is a win for the whole world, the president went on referring to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump’s Nobel improbable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee that decides to award the prize has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a diverse world order – just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed to.
In the 2000s, the award was given to three U.S. politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, the awarding of Trump would require a complete ideological shift from the Nobel committee.
Fire announcement in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like conspirators and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic jam at Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sti Lohja took place on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was cut off due to the announcement in both Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are motorists on the road and they are driving how to hit, the fire master Pasi K<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>ri<0xC3><0xA4>inen told STT at the time.
At the time, the motorway was started to drive in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, the traffic safety contact manager, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not be stopped except for compulsory reasons.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go out and endanger traffic with solutions that have been lost.
Alarm vehicles must always be given the most unhindered possible passage.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as well as making a U-translation and cancelling.
The same prohibitions apply to tunnels where driving lights must be switched on at all times.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as surely also parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped at the tunnel to brush snow off his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, Heiskanen says in the Transport Safety Communication.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration even if the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans, carried by M/S Tampere, would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue their celebration of victory, even if the ship had been stuck on the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrj<0xC3><0xA4>, who was the head of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was travelling from H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna to Tampere, set off late on Saturday evening and got stuck at the bottom of the Old River in Aka.
19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt by a friend.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration on the ship until morning, but it was certainly more sensible to send them on fire station rides to the port and on the bus home, Syrj<0xC3><0xA4> told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win over Ilves.
According to the exception, on Saturday the vessel was due to the fact that the surface of the water in the Old Sea was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrj<0xC3><0xA4>, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest street sign was in the shade of the locks, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn.
No more to mention the collision.
A friend took place on the west side of the narrow Jumussensalmi, shortly after the ship had crossed the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
The larger drama was not associated with the case, according to Syrj<0xC3><0xA4>, because the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more pronounced collision.
According to the exception, the anchoring of the base has not caused the vessel to leak and does not press, and in this view, the vessel's cruises continue normally.
The diver went Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship began to pull out of the shallows.
For the sake of certainty, we will go to the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused, Syrj<0xC3><0xA4> says.
The diver believes that the next scheduled cruise to M/S Tampere next weekend can be handled in an agreed manner.
According to him, the cruise period of the ship will continue until the date of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue agency received an alert on Saturday night after a little after 12 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but ambulances were not available.
Firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult because of the darkness and rather severe wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency announced on Sunday that all those on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruise line, built in 1957, is preceded by the years 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's Justice Candidate Accused of Harassment and Drunkenness May Be Out of Top Office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as the U.S. Supreme Court justice, may well be out of office, says Mika Aaltola, program director at the Institute for Foreign Affairs.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and abusive behavior during her studies.
According to Aalto, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may decide to take office with someone else.
In the United States, it has happened in the past that the president's candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of contradictions.
In this case, the judge has usually resigned himself, says Aaltola.
In this way, the President has been able to keep his face.
The appointment would lead to the Democratic camp
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party's camp in the upcoming Congress polls.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity for nomination does not fall for every presidential term, as the judges of the highest court in the United States are appointed to life.
In practice, some of them have left their own request for retirement at the age of about 70-80 years.
Even some Republicans doubt the name.
The U.S. Supreme Court's nominees are being made a background check on the normalists, Aaltola says.
While Trump has only set a week’s deadline for the FBI’s additional briefing, it can still bring up something significant, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it could bring.
There is rarely a smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or dissatisfaction with the office is still being discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators believe Kavanaugh's nomination is questionable.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and the Republicans to lose.
Woman Recognizes Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identified the poisonings in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of a suspected Russian man.
The woman said based on the photos that it was a military investigation by Anatoli Tshepiga, who works at GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed another poisoning from suspected men to Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities are covert humanities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East near the border between Russia and China, where Chepiga grew up.
The woman in the village identified the photos of the publication of the young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the images of the same man in the British police who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov himself today.
The Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a Novishok hermopoly in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded the Russian Hero’s Medal of Honor in 2014.
Russia continues to deny the suspect's GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning told Russian television in an interview in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Older people throwing bags in the war reform
There has now been a vivid example of what the Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> government’s definition of military reform in practice means.
Vaala’s military services are produced by Oulunkaari municipality, which has been elected as Health Service Director in 2016 by the former Regional Director of Attendo.
Mayors of the city hall warn the council about the change limit.
If war spending rises now, the state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers have stalled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in old age care, which would end the hospital’s day care facility and the small memorial ward unit.
Home care would be added, which means that the elderly living in remote villages will be torn from their roots to be treated as a "home" next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay the customers for it.
The left wing of Vaala did not swallow poor preparation, but organised a good public meeting, which included many owners, close-ups and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with the parts of the war-state preparation how the elderly are already being treated at home in the municipality of Vaala, most of all in the Nordic Nordic region.
Also included was the neighbouring authority Carina L<0xC3><0xA4>ntinen.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the opportunity, and it again brought the Oulunkaari producers to their backs.
Warlords do not write on any of the papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Valala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Practitioners only talk about service regulations, but do not tell what levels of treatment they receive or what personnel structure Attendo will treat the elderly until they are treated.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the premises of the health centre are terminated because there is no doctor’s night nap.
Attendo will also take care of doctors at the Vaala Health Center.
Vaala’s example shows how central officials turn around with the most incomplete information, and the authorised ones point their back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Central Party will vacate the inhabitants of Vaala, because who will remain insecure to live there voluntarily, if there is the possibility of moving away.
Was there an election slogan in the center that the whole country is considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, he read in the ranks of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit, which began on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been tight.
On the streets of Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan said that his visit to Germany had been successful and that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations with countries that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup d’état.
Merkel stressed, however, that there are deep disagreements between countries on, inter alia, human rights issues.
Review Surrounded by a Visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia’s Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he came to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets of Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the last stage of Erdogan’s German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three accused of journalist’s murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancé, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police detained eight people in the investigation of the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February at his home in Bratislava.
He had researched the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murder of Kuciak in connection with the investigation.
The incident and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of herds on Sundays in distilleries
Due to the printing error, Karjalainen will also have to post unaddressed on Sunday.
This may be seen in the distribution of the newspaper in the institutional areas where distribution to co-boxes must be performed from external memory.
The situation was the same for the newspaper on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post places additional newspaper stamps on the county.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Mondays.
The distribution of these papers is noticeably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Editor Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala today in his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she stole from Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which was required to pay as a bank loan.
If the original plans had been right, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the departure date has been delayed by one year.
Now it seems that after the failed training, which took place in 2014 and required the death penalty, things are on the line.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his journey will be about a year after his first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is in an unweighted position for 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut tells about his upcoming website.
At the same address, he also reflects his desire for space.
When I was a kid, I read a series called Space Travel and watched the Star Trek series on television.
Star Wars has been seen, and that's what that thought was about.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a great host.
Manchester City continued their lossless streak in the Champions League when it fell to 2-0 in their home game against Brighton on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero are the winners of the sixth win of the reigning championship team.
Sterling was able to direct the season from a close distance to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute from the back of Brighton's goal.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero raised his score to five when he scored with Sterling to return to the Brighton defence in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentinian managed to place 2-0 in a penalty shootout easily.
With six wins and one draw, City started the season leading the Electoral League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who have played less than one game, are only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea on Saturday night in their seventh round match of the series three.
Young people elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its final meeting on Sunday, Finland’s Youth Societies selected new decision-makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
The president was elected Anu Sivone Yl<0xC3><0xA4>-Sava and the vice president was Petra M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4>inen H<0xC3><0xA4>me.
The Board was elected by 40 actual members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations reported on Sunday.
The Youth Council meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
In its three-year operational objectives, the Youth Council, organized in Joensuu, gives three promises: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organize equal entertainment activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteer activities and people with their own growth.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6> and surprised Ferrari: “A very important driver is missing”
In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu was asked if he believed that Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen’s release from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari in World Cup points with Sebastian Vettel at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen announced that he will move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen would throw his gloves at the table.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in the remaining kitties.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen has been one of his leading figures.
I don’t know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 games on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian Participant.
The starting point of the race is Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
Afternoon follows the cat from moment to moment.
The championship match in the SM-series of the youth of football became a full farce: the opponent arrived on the spot with only 7 players strength
The boys’ top tier of football ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the 13 o’clock round, the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti Academy has practically enough points against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, Ilves, the second in the championship fight, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the team.
However, in practice, the Lahti championship was secured before the start of the tournament, as Vasa IFK had only reached Lahti with seven players.
If there had been one less, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At that time, the team led 7-0.
One of the reasons for this is that the team has played in part with the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Second C group.
Vasa IFK has played in practice against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday in the second round, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their guest fight against KuFu in Siilinj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof in Enossa - according to the rescue agency, happiness was involved
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up on the roof at Enos on Sunday at 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue agency said.
There was good luck, the report said.
According to the rescue agency, the road was wet after the rain.
The police party was at the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to investigate: Equipment procurements and recruitments already made, the activities planned abroad are not skipped
According to Antti Pelttar, head of the soup, the inquiry law has been prepared by making purchases of equipment and training staff.
When the investigative laws come into force, the budget of the soup would be permanently increased by about EUR 10 million.
In the premises of the security police (supon) located in Ratakadu in Helsinki, a complete decision is already being prepared for the entry into force of the investigative laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of the association, tells the Western Media that there have already been acquisitions of equipment for future investigative powers.
Serena Williams is shocked by a video in which she sings in a non-partisan manner - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is coming back.
Now he’s campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on his Instagram account, in which he sings only his hands in front of his chest, the news agency AFP reports.
The song is a 1991 Australian song by The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I voiced The Divinyls’ global hit to remind women to do regular self-checks,” Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women regardless of skin color around the world.
Timely detection is everything a and o - it spoils many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first,” Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams was kicked out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There's a kick in the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams caught fire at the match's referees and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for much more extreme use than women's players.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for high-rise rooms
In addition to traditional Chinese flavors, the restaurant serves stunning landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang province of China.
It is literally in the language of the rock.
If you want, you can look at the forest below.
The lush landscapes at high altitudes make restaurant visitors immerse themselves in the life of Longquan Mountain.
Access to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on September 19, 2018.
In the comments on YouTube, you wonder where the restaurant is located in the bathroom.
A walk to the restaurant requires a good foundation, the location is told.
This Is How It All Ends Today
Everything good ends in time.
Today, that’s what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela’s chicken run, which has been quite popular.
The third season of production has gone like hot stones: last week the season saw 722,000 Finns on TV as their first show.
It is no longer of any practical significance to the summits, as the series of Heikki Luoma and Jukka M<0xC3><0xA4>kisen is not going to continue.
In the final period, Jaska and Mirku are again taken with the aim of a leap forward, and Jaska's mother seems to guess first what to keep coming.
Between Ans and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, directly romantic, but then Laiho appears in the patterns once again.
The police are also in a suspicious position with regard to the man.
Yet no one can predict the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear the incredible news.
The final will of the crowd comes out, which gets a woman on the verge of tears.
A week later, on Sunday nights, the new episodes of Sorjonen will continue.
I'm going to go to TV1 tonight at 21:05.
Should I go to work on a little flu tomorrow?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people stay home or not.
However, it is worth thinking about whether it is worth going to infect others, because the disease can be contagious even if your symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the hives.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
According to prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus takes as long as a day before the symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may be infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough boils and there is no more heat, says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the room to slow down the recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, moisten your nostrils and throw the scraping paper into the trash.
Is it painful to move?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
The fingers will not be placed in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also, the puzzles are limited to the machine.
So how can we avoid infections?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats mission statement: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
The ice cream maker and the missus are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
In 2018, Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been awarded her Finnish crown.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina’s mother is a Finnish and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for her father's Russianness.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was harassed because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina tells Miss Suomi in the semi-finalist press.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to school.
Soon the missive found new friends and the sheet went to roll hopefully.
At the age of 15, he imagines himself to be an adult, but thinking about it afterwards, I really wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelican’s lines.
After the SM-league career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was part of the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
At the beginning of the meeting, the couple was in a relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I were to get into the winner's triangle and it would make a career worse for me, then I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, we have a good relationship of trust and in the distance it is a good thing that it will stay on top of the whole time, Alina groaned in May.
Continual growth with joy, death on our cheeks
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Yet, nothing is willing to give up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continued growth, but the theory of rational economy is also faced with major problems.
Over the course of a few generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living, of which only dreams were previously achieved.
However, the long-standing overshoot and climate change of the Earth's bearing capacity are making this market economy's foothold dangerous.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night at Kannelm<0xC3><0xA4>ki Sitratori at four o'clock in the morning.
The man, born in 1986, was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, born in 1968 more slowly.
Older men have already been discharged from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for other suspects related to the incident.
Events are being investigated as an attempt to kill and as a serious abuse.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach made a mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's draw against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished 1-1 in the 78th minute of the match.
Sivelholt got through from the right side and successfully lifted the ball over the goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest game, the Marian Haminians knocked the difference to the Turku Ball Association, which is located in the serial box, to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, tightened Marianhamna head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not get into the fight as he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately the Turkic goal brought us closer to the game.
Inter's head coach, John Allen, said the game was under control, but the paint job again caused pain.
One defense blunder took us to a full point point, Allen said.
We were the best again!

The magazine showed its sub-power skills, the location of the game is not yet certain
Jori Lehter<0xC3><0xA4>’s strong under-powered play came when his NHL teammate Philadelphia Flyers played their last practice match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehter<0xC3><0xA4> scored twice for Michael Raffl.
In recent days, the magazine has been on display for drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehter<0xC3><0xA4> is one of 23 suspected drug groups with some suspected drug use and some with sales, for example.
The journalist has denied that he was guilty of a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, the Philadelphia Inquirer’s next close-knit reporter for Flyers, estimates after the game that Lehter<0xC3><0xA4> is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom are in the NHL.
According to Carchid, Lehter<0xC3><0xA4> was excellent in the training match.
In the second inning, Lehter<0xC3><0xA4> fought the ball for himself by subduing, dragged the defender against him and fed Raffl waiting for the goal.
The second time the cooperation of the two brought the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a draw against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team’s training team to decide whether to join the NHL.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” Vaakanainen said on Boston’s Twitter account in an interview.
Vaakanainen, who was given a round-up at the riverside, played against Philadelphia at 19.31 minutes.
In the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask gave up a fourth time and fought 20 times.
Vili Saarij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi, a strong back-to-back defender, made Detroit a 1-0 lead when the team fell to Toronto 5-1.

Oilers agreed to include Jesse Puljuj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Florida’s Aleksander Barkov played for 20 minutes and scored a goal against Tampa Bay in the local game.

New picture shows change: The world’s strongest man lost tens of pounds
In 2017, the world’s most powerful man, Eddie Hall, undergoes an eye-catching transformation.
Eddie Hall, a British man, has been hunting for the title of the world’s most powerful man for a long time and determinedly.
Hall was able to eat up to 10,000 kilos of food a day and weighed 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to hurting his body.
The human brain has not been created to be the size of this, Hall said.
Britt hunted for the world's strongest man by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he gets the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen in the 2018 World's Strongest Men's World Championships held in April.
Hall recently posted a picture on Instagram, in which he poses significantly for his active career in a slimmer condition.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169.5 kg.
Hall wrote that he practiced aerobics five times a week today.
The program includes, among other things, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, Haf<0xC3><0xBE><0xC3><0xB3>r J<0xC3><0xBA>l<0xC3><0xAD>us Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rnsson, the most powerful man in the world, was crowned by an Icelandic, also known for the Game of Thrones TV series.

Restaurant boat M/S Tampere crashed on a boat in Pyh<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>rvi - "Strengthfully stuck on a stone bridge"
Inland watercraft M/S Tampere drove the boat late Friday evening at Akaala Pyh<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>rvi.
The rescue agency received a warning of a water traffic accident on Friday night after 12 p.m.
The 30-metre M/S Tampere is anchored to the hull, and is firmly attached to its hull with a stone pillar, described the daytime fire master Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue agency, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they will be transferred by bus to Tampere, said Jari Nieminen STT’s CEO after one o’clock at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship from H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna to Tampere had drifted off the route to the west of the narrow Jumussensalmi.
The police will find out the cause of the incident.
The daytime fire master Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult because of the darkness and rather severe wind.
According to the rescue agency, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship doesn't seem to be leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check what is at the bottom of the situation.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is an inland watercraft currently operating as a restaurant boat, with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
The vessel also has a private meeting room for rent.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-Managers Demand Unpaid Rewards from Robert Heleneuk
Boxer Robert Helenius' night match against Erka Teper is shadowing the rats.
Tonight, the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and the deputy judge Jussi Kokkila announced a challenge application in which a total of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80,000 in unpaid management fees will be collected from Helenauk at a late rate.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenikus on 15.04.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to agree, but there is no other option.
This has been a clear mandate, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila told Ilta-Sanomi.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehde, telling about the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
In response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services financially in a supportive situation and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsorships for him.
Literally, it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
They were repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the proceeds arranged by them.
This is also a normal and unique practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed and such would have also been unreasonable in the case of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There has never been a written agreement on cooperation.
According to him, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He, for his part, made the proposal poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmis.
Helenius did not even pretend to be involved with Kokkila and Helmis.
A year after the end of the cooperation, a "unique but significant" reduction in the work of the manager was shown to Helenius.
This year, the same arguments have been raised.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be peaceful, in return it is stated.
Today, Helenius will face the boxing league in Stuttgart, the seventh in the IBF’s heavy series of challengers, Erkan Teper.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the former radio broadcaster and publisher Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>llin for decades.
Radio broadcaster and journalist Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>lli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The statement of the deceased was published on Sunday in Helsinki’s Sanomi.
The announcement says P<0xC3><0xA4>lli died on September 3.
P<0xC3><0xA4>lli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, whose knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance was dead.
He left Facebook earlier as if to say goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>ll<0xC3><0xA4> as a multi-gifted expert, who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers that P<0xC3><0xA4>ll was considered a man with fast chopsticks and funny things.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
We met up with Erki.
He was then Finnlevy’s informant and in various roles, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I moved on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>lli was the standard producer at all the festivals.
He was always an expert and I saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a good man and a good reporter.
For many he became known as a respected Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki has interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio cheers.
Over the decades, P<0xC3><0xA4>lli has worked with Toivo K<0xC3><0xA4>rje in addition to the publishing company Fazer.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion of the field was radio work, in which he had a peculiar style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to many listeners in the Yle ether.
The field retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450,000.
The Union describes its economic situation as a "complete transition", although the economy is, of course, burdened by a "significant debt in balance".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala encourages a quick reaction and a tight economic curve.
We responded to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn by taking adaptation measures.
Careful planning of operations and management of the economy has been impacted throughout our organization, Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and in addition, the World Cup performance was the maximum in the previous season.
However, further management of costs must also be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie on the back of the hospital in the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area for which injured survivors have been collected for the assessment of the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to the aftereffects.
One of those who moved to the hospital was a 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him last time when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arm, was lying in the courtyard of the Army Hospital in Palus.
He was at the beginning of the conflict in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I probably got stuck under a wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe," Haris told the AP, according to British media.
Small businesses are being robbed.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her baby from the heat.
He described the atmosphere in the city as circular.
Clean water is fine.
Small shops are being looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the residents of Please have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house was somehow capable, the possible aftermath could destroy it definitively and bury the inhabitants alone.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in the prison fled after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there are probably about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in the Donggala prison have also been kidnapped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became angry and set fire to the prison after the guards had refused to leave in search of their relatives who suffered an earthquake and tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first was an Army C-130 transporter, which brought aid supplies to the field.
Commercial flights to the Please field are only allowed for a limited time.
The pilots are forced to land on the ground without the help of the air traffic controller, as the air traffic control tower was damaged in a bad earthquake.
Sade wipes at night over Finland
The entire country spreads across the country on Sunday night against a long rain zone from the direction of the west, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain mostly comes from water, but in Central and Northern Lapland there is expected to be flooding or snow.
Last night's frosty packages are not repeated, as the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
Cloudy nights keep the lowest temperatures quite efficiently under control.
Just in the west you can instantly visit the side of the pack, said meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sundays, the rain will fall to the east in the morning.
In the south and west there are bumpy or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.

Wind and wave warnings are in force in the marine areas.
Actual autumn storms are not expected in the coming days, but otherwise the permit will have a typical autumnal variable weather.
Yes, that autumn is starting to blow up very seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi final is not shown on TV
From IL-TV you can follow the glamour and radiance of the red carpet of the Miss Suomi competition.
Evening entertainment broadcasters draw a live broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from Billn<0xC3><0xA4>s's hut.
The shipment starts at around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned among ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final will be held in Billn<0xC3><0xA4>s square in Raasepor.
Before the start of the final, you will be able to monitor the atmosphere on the spot during the live broadcast of IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts at around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a lot of Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They are represented by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other representatives of the court are Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Managing Director of Jouni Kaupa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he could get to college before he left for Mississippi.
Russian Dimitri’s father and Hungarian Svetlana’s mother believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
Recently, Alina Voronkova’s parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova followed her daughter’s first moments away from the crown.
They reached the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
What a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Englishman and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina spoke fluent Russian, even though she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss’s career.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty, she should start to miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
It wasn’t until later that Alina was excited about beauty contests.
The parents’ wish was for Alina to get to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her degree before the Mississippis.
We asked him why he didn’t participate last year, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on stage, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is looking for a job in Japan, and they did not get to Finland to encourage their loved one in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between the young will last a year.
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be!
My parents hoped that my daughter would be able to visit soon.
There has been such a long break in visits due to mischievous conditions.
I'm sorry, but I've already got messages.
A young man died in a river in Lahti, police arrested three people
Police said three people were arrested as a result of the incident.
H<0xC3><0xA4>meen police on Saturday did not comment on the course of the events and did not overdo the possible willfulness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the arrested persons and the deceased man were aware of each other.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - I remember the idea of the cartoon: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
In the past, my husband’s speech, in which he proposed that I develop it as a person in the story, was inspired by a series of films, says Sari Piippo, an Estonian film blogger, a mother and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says he was in Brussels as an EU translator on economic and legal matters until after his fourth child, ten years ago, the family became a returnee.
I enjoyed being a housewife really well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I remembered what it would do when the youngest child started to grow up.
In 2014, a series of photos were taken.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintti and Asterix as a child.
I had been drawing for the last time as a child, but when these writings of the Creator began to be born, the situation changed.
At the beginning, I made a few dozen manuscripts on the tabletop.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled painter, but I didn’t get her attracted to me until summer 2016, when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His passion lasted for a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying on his own, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
Drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something ahead of time.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, Piippo says about his relationship with drawing, which he usually engages in at night.
The manuscripts are constantly popping in my mind, but usually I don’t make them at the same time.
It takes up to several hours for a three-screen stripper.
I can do the screen at once and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not the strongest type.
Sari Piippo shares his appreciation for the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams’ Dilbert.
The people of the wild are enchanted with the L-themed porcupine mother with salad dressing.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the wildest world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a forced drink, even though he sometimes feels it.
Piippo tells her to read her series with her husband and children.
It’s a great feeling when you look at the comic book and you realize that’s what I’ve done today.
There are enough challenges for my mother!
You can read the series on the web at klumuhomppa.sarajakuvablogit.com
Lotto's million dollar jackpot left in the wind - these were the right numbers
There were no full rounds in Lotto 39/2018.
Tonight’s biggest wins were seen in Saturday’s Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.

Indonesia earthquake: The flight attendant sacrificed himself - did not leave a crumbling tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe
The 21-year-old flight director, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he got a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from an island ravaged by an earthquake.
The young man was in turn at the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Palu, when an earthquake struck on Friday.
When the others fled from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being guided by a Batik Air passenger plane.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Air Force told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight deck collapsed and collapsed.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His legs were broken and he had severe internal injuries.
Agung was admitted to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation representative told The Jakarta Post.
The impact was further enhanced to allow the flight to take off, and its strength was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Air Administration has honored Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn thought about Europe's trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also lowered its own economic growth estimates a bit.
President Olli Rehn said at Yle’s first meeting that while the tightening of tensions does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
This also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehni believes that Europe is currently very bready.
It has been able to build a rapprochement with the United States and partly calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not appear to be at the feet of a crumbling trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner towards Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted fiercely on Thursday evening by the Italian government to introduce a clearly below-average budget.
Next year’s deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s borrowing rate is problem loans and unregulated loans amount to more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public economy is in a weak position and the country again appears to be exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead to the new economic crisis in Europe.
The second thing that Europe is experiencing is Britain’s separation from the EU.
Rehn wanted it to fit.
There would be a much more negative impact on the dispute.
Rehn started as Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President and CEO of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down after a fair year.
The conversation with his followers has begun.
Both Rehni and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen’s name has been echoed in speeches.
It certainly does not matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on this further.
HS's super-favorite Black Box shows will continue again next week - the latest tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular performances organized by Helsinki’s Sanomien Black Box will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23 The Black Box will be visiting the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets on sale at the National Theatre.
The Tampere show has been sold out.
Tickets for sale Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the producers and photographers on stage tell a long-prepared true story that has not been previously published on any HS instrument.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
“There is a strange spy in Helsinki at night, an impressive report from the other side of the world and a telling story about a very topical health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS’s suppliers and photographers and continue the discussion.
Sanomat in Helsinki has organized the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the site.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier area as a journalist of the year.
The awardees thanked the new way of doing journalism and the journalists’ desire to get close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box can be seen in the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also be held in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the presentation will have a different content than in this part of the evening.
Missing filter found thanks to "unprecedented experiment"
Finnish police drone expertise is the top in the world: "We are asked for training"
According to the head of the police department, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in criminal investigations and investigative tasks.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a missing smuggler drone in Raaha in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the director of the police department’s university, tweeted, “With unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also at the forefront of the world.”
The drone is a brand new entourage and even more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be the master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
“There’s a lot of interest elsewhere,” says Himberg.
It would be very difficult for visitors to watch the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more widespread.
Himberg points out that finding lost in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the missing person was found using a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are meant to train more.
Already now, the drone is used a lot in police duties, and their use is widespread and will increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for the missing, the police can use drones, according to Himberg, for example, in the investigation of an accident or a crime scene and in certain investigative tasks.
For example, it is already necessary to review an area a little further, where it is possible to be afraid that there will be violence.
In this case, the drone can be used for pre-testing.
Karelia's Rugby Rises to First Division
Karjala Rugby celebrates victory in the 2nd Division on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Joensuu were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found the line and shook the guests of the south 26-12.
At the same time, Karjala Rugby’s 2nd Division championship saw a historic rise to the 1st Division.
The club has previously played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-division 1 division.
The company plans to take up the show, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of at least 20 players must be raised to 25.
The 1st Division is also aware of the increase in the number of games and longer game modes, so the acquisition of funds must also be in accordance with it.
Kotkaniemi to start season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens at the NHL, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise for Kotkanieme, 18, in the first round at the number three summer reservation event.
The attacker joined Montreal's training force in the late summer and has presented strong shots in the September training matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to score a goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien encouraged the Finnish to take a major development step after arriving at the income camp.
The NHL fixtures will start on Thursday night against Finland’s time.
Montreal will face the opening round of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa told about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but even in previous Nokia investigations, there has been talk of the inability of executives to act as a team; fear and insincerity, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile business.
The company’s risk-taking capacity and volatility have disappeared.
A giant event of business life was also held in Helsinki this week at the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the cream of Finnish business life to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, there were 12 stars in the business world.
Talk about good leadership is enough.
Gary Hamel, the management legend, said that a good manager should dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most spiritually connected to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods chain, known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff about the company’s purpose.
And that purpose cannot be simply to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the book, said that the most successful leaders are scientifically humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the stage of the company’s life cycle.
At the initial stage of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
Growing up in the mature stage, the company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
There was a threat of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
That’s why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the background.
But they were wondering if they were the right people for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from the outside.
Sara Chafak arrived at the beautiful red carpet directly from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Sara Chafak came to the finals in a beautiful black dress.
The dress of 2012 Miss Finland also had a lace finish.
I can't get any more jets.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles.
Among other things, he has made commercials.
Working in the United States, he describes them as interesting, and also similar, as in Finland.
However, according to him, the work has to be done even harder, because the model is always easy to find a replacement for the work.
You have to shoot harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

Danish police found a large Volvo in a search operation: "We can't tell from where"
Widespread searches by the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jewish Quarter and Iso-Belt.
All land and boat traffic from the island of Sj<0xC3><0xA4>llann was closed in Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the mountain manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The vehicle you are looking for has been found.
We still can't tell where the car was found, Henrik Storm told the Copenhagen police.
According to Storm, the black Volvo police say has no direct contact with the threat.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Danish woman Ekstra Bladet told police on Saturday about a news conference.
J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov, the director of the investigation, was responsible for the cost of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me which criminal title to investigate.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people were searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell you if they've already been arrested.
According to the magazine, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the large public no longer has a cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disparity - now the people vote on it in enough elections
Macedonia, located in the Balkans, is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would become the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has, with its right of veto, blocked Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greek, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
When it comes to the referendum, there is no mention of a new name, but rather a question of whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's EU-NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote began online at least at a school in the centre of Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted for the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum means a change if it opens its doors to Europe and NATO.
“It means change, especially for young people,” he said.
In 1991, the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was used in official contacts.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the approval of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough excitement as to whether the voter turnout will exceed the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but yes, the victory would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. in Finnish time.
Nice win!
Robert Helenius toppled Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper in a heavy series of professional shopping events in Germany late Saturday evening.
A 34-year-old Finnish man took measurements of his 36-year-old German opponent in the Waldenbuchi in the Stuttgart Cup.
The night’s main match was the IBF Intercontinental competition in the heavy series.
The winner may be given the opportunity to meet on Saturdays in tougher tasks that have a significant economic significance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth inning, when he punched Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third inning, when the German nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the circle for the first time.
They had to fight back in December 2015.
Then Teper called for an injury and withdrew from the game.
After that, it turned out that the German had undergone a doping test twice.
Helenius has won 28 of his professional career matches and has suffered two losses.
Teper, a clear favourite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton's bet order to win - the difference to Vetteli is already 50 points
The Formula One championship came close to being confirmed again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and drew Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are still five cats left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left Kisa’s pole position, drove for the second time.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who lost his career, held the top spot in the middle of the race, but Mercedes ordered Botta to pass Hamilton.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari’s Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
A couple abused their fiancee in Joensuu, stuck in a block away.

Police said the men also intercepted the victim’s phone.
Police reached the suspect, a 35-year-old man from July, and a 39-year-old man from Nilomansila, near the spot shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of theft, police say.
The victim was given birth control pills that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk is leaving his role as chairman of the company’s board of directors.

Musk will continue to be Tesla’s CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach an agreement on oil with the US
The time is coming to an end in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on oil.
The United States has set a deadline on Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely over the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, spoke at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations in full.
At President Donald Trump’s request, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement on Oil.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to put into effect the agreement before the Mexican presidential election won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign a deal at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these schedules, the U.S.-Canada treaty text should be ready on Sunday for the U.S. Congress to have enough time to assess it.
Neighbour thought candles were set on fire in Kaakkuri - fire brigade was alerted to the site
The candles burned in the apartment building in Oulu Kaakkuri caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the scene because of a possible floor-to-ceiling incident.
It turned out that the candles that had burned in the sauna of the apartment had appeared in the opposite house from a fire, which is why it had been reported to the emergency centre.
There was no fire at the site.
Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - looting at the field and metro station
Police arrested 11 people after Saturday's Honka-HJK match, a men's soccer league played in Espoo, Western New Zealand Police Commissioner Teemu V<0xC3><0xA4>rtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the lack of interest was to protect against crime and disturbance.
The hostages were released after the situation had calmed down, V<0xC3><0xA4>rtinen said.
She had previously told me about the evening news.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators flocked to the field from the stand reserved for supporters of HJK.
The situation led to suffocation and fist fights between the supporters of the teams.
Among other things, horse police officers were needed to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, excavations took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the attractions also took place.
I wasn’t there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, V<0xC3><0xA4>rtinen referred to the looting that took place on the field.
According to V<0xC3><0xA4>rtien, no criminal charges have been filed as a result of the events.
The table-stone disturbed the butterfly in its SE time at the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku P<0xC3><0xB6>yt<0xC3><0xA4>kivi have advanced to the finals of the swimming World Cup 3/7 on the final day of the competition in the Netherlands.
Cats swim in Eindhoven on a short trail.
HSS’s Table Stone upset Finland’s record in the 50-metre butterfly jump, where he was the second of the starters at 22.82.
Earlier in September, P<0xC3><0xB6>yt<0xC3><0xA4>kivi swims in Helsinki during the SE-time of the trip 22,77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus, was a butterfly at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was at the start of the 50 metre breaststroke at 30.48 and advanced to the final.
At the start of the two-hundred-meter mix, Laukkanen had a time of 2.14.25.
Students exhibit a rare taste: an ancient tragedy - simplified Oreste seems to have a visual effect
Tragedies of ancient times are rare in Finnish theatres.
For example, the National Theatre has seen the last ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Academy of Theatres brought the only complete surviving playwright trilogy, Aiskhylos Oresteia, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! projects, which started in 2015, acting students at the Theatre College work together with a professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, as well as the first, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His international first night Oreste was held in Berlin in April.
Roiha's agreement on Oreste summarizes the account of the end of the bloodguilt of the condemned Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, with twenty minutes, in particular, by narrowing the sections of the choir.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuure’s fine Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the show’s revealing display of the theatre space underscores the simplicity and clarity of stage thinking.
At the center of it is the dynamics between the performers who diverge from the chorus, who play nominative roles, and the chorus.
The proposal uses both double and triple interpretations of nominative roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra returning from the Trojan War are shown on the stage, as was the custom in the ancient performing tradition.
Of course, the proposal does not underline its loyalty to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, text-faithful interpretation is created before the eyes of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out the master’s degree students as a close group, directly as a single organism, a group of rhythmic people.
Especially in the choir sections, actors who are keenly inclined to the very expressive, funerary group formations will be able to access their rights openly, only by decorating a white rosary, on the stage.
That's impressive.
Oresteia’s performance will continue at the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen cargo
The innovation begins to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published in the Hannover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a new model of a thousand car parts for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell truck, Hyundai will continue the Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this quality, with the world’s first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example, by monitoring the development of the fuel grid, Hyundai Motor’s deputy managing director In Cheol Lee said in a statement.
Cages swirled several times in Kajaan
A little over thirty-something man abused three men in a restaurant in central Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside a restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he would throw another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser beat him again.
The police arrested the perpetrator.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened the police with mistreatment and killing.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three counts of abuse and as a violent opposition to the official.
In the center of Kajaani there was also a second case of abuse on Saturday morning.
The victim was abused by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Caucasian man struck a victim.
A little later, another man threw him into the ground and the man who had previously beaten still kicked the victim.
Outsiders dragged the informants away from the victim and the police were called to the scene.
However, the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the eyewitnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone on 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tukinta.kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long line radio broadcaster Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>lli has died
Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>lli, known as Yle’s longtime editor, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki P<0xC3><0xA4>lli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, it's time to go.
The doctor has also said it, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation to the hospital a month ago.
The safety of the shop’s aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first received a magazine subscription in 1984.
When a subject gets caught up in these years, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and, for a moment, even a little angry.
I also spoke about the case with Erika K<0xC3><0xA4>h<0xC3><0xA4>r<0xC3><0xA4>, a working environment expert from the Union of Professional Services (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of clearly serious cases and many of the real violent situations remain unreported.
“Of course, companies have an obligation to keep statistics close to their situation on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain in-house and do not collect their data anywhere,” he said.
Spiritual injuries do not end in statistics.
In situations of violence, there has always been the problem that they do not always give birth to physical injuries.
Mental trauma can still be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat has to be considered a violence - even if it is not a handshake.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if the real act doesn’t happen.
Some residential areas are uncomfortable.
The store has got security guards.
At the time of the release of the opening hours of the stores, the visible fluctuation in the media was also quite large, due to its impact on the safety of the sellers.
“At that time, quite a few employers arranged security services for at least overnight hours and to prevent working alone,” K<0xC3><0xA4>h<0xC3><0xA4>r<0xC3><0xA4> commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, due to the security, the disturbance situation remained well-managed, the idea emerged that the security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
A slight abuse is a barrister’s crime, and it is quite understandable that an abused seller does not want to make an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But the same, according to the section of the 2011 law, a slight abuse will turn under the prosecutor if it happens in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
Next time I trade my aunt or uncle in the wrong place, the police should investigate and charge the prosecutor.
When the court would put a few criminals in jail, and the sentence from there would be severe punishment, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the food trade must be open even in small towns, almost overnight, must guarantee the safety of the workers in the trade.
Heidi Sohlberg called Miss before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iro is then married"
Miss’s crowning this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast shows the Viafree site.
The show will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Janni Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet promoter.
Prior to the live broadcast, the trio told the invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a flurry of applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now, look at this man of ours, Sohlberg sneered at his colleague when the crowd roared.
The progressive skirts are followed by many of the previous years in Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg paused, looking at the Saro.
More likely, Sohlberg was referring to a recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though at first it seemed confused.
The sippy spoke for the first time in the evening-Sanomi weekend magazine.
Missikaunotar said he did not want to open up the reasons for the difference in public, as it is a matter between him and Roope Salmisen.
He said he's not in a hurry to have a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
Focusing on my own stories and especially the field of living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marital status came up at a later stage, when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The three of us laughed out loud.
Irohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi made a mess.
The Founding Father Tortured His Bonded Open Spouse by Cooling, Burning and Feeding a Strong Caste
The Supreme Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man in Kokkola to three years in prison for the numerous crimes committed by his open-door spouse.
The means of crime were, among other things, belt, cable and nipples.
The court ruled that these items were lost to the State.
The case of the gang involved a suspect in a serious rape.
However, this claim was rejected by the district court.
The cause of the Kokkolainen was four abuses, severe abuse, coercion, illegal threat, freedom struggle, severe freedom struggle, and two injuries.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May last year.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the Nordic Court of Human Rights handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
There is no evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two serious violations of freedom and a serious rape on May 22.
However, these allegations were rejected by the court as unsubstantiated.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the district court issued a public statement on the judgment.
According to the judge, the accused had faced violence, threats and coercion against his wife in situations where this had been committed.
The accused shot his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a powerful sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to lose criminal means: belt and cable, tie ties, bathing belt, knife and water cannon.
The Four Witnesses
According to the copyright law, the parties continued to co-exist between acts.
It can be read from the sentence that a large part of the most brutal acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old victim must pay compensation for pain, suffering, and temporary damage totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,800.
He hardly has that kind of money, because the convict already has debts of his old age in inheritance.
Imprisonment is not a man's first.
The night watch doesn't tell the convicted person's name to protect the victim's privacy.
When writing this, a recent jury verdict is not legally binding.
Europe to lead the Ryder Cup with four points
European golfers were arrested on Saturday for their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup with the Paris Flames at 10-6 points, while on Sunday there are still twelve doubles playing.
Europe won three out of four four four-ball games starting on Saturday, and in the afternoon four-ball game the winnings were levelled 2-2.
Europe’s leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had ever had a similar relationship.
On Sunday, the two of them will be aiming for more history.
No European player has won five points in the Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have ever won more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns his supporters' unrest in Honka match: "Violence does not belong in football"
On Sunday, HJK released a statement condemning the behaviour of its supporters in a brazen match at FC Honka in Tapiola.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some appeared to be trying to challenge Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organisers were not able to calm the situation, but police and also horse police were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and staff were shocked by what had happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of the traditional 111-year-old.
"We strongly reject any such action that endangers the safety of match-fixing events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers to identify safety-threatening factors and remove mild symptoms.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
In every way, we support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football clubs.
“Violence is not part of that,” the statement said.
Philippine inventor flies by drone car - how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group of people around the world who swear to have invented a flying car, or at least their own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports, the man has spent a large part of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he flagged with his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid the threat of traffic jams.
I hope that the device will generate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow’s work-fighting actions will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
The bans on overwork and mountaineering, which will begin tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors, will be seen in particular in social and health services and children’s day care, says P<0xC3><0xA4>ivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff on the site.
Everyone has to think about how they will find their child.
The employer’s job now is to make sure that the services are playing and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year, when the members of the JHL were in the overwork and mountain-exchange ban due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through the flexibility that the staff has not been hired, but that the employees have remained in overtime or changed shifts.
This is not yet a labor struggle.
It is the norm for occupational safety to be concerned about regular working hours for each employee and only about them.
JHL is opposed to measures aimed at mitigating the dismissal of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, the Labour Market Manager for Municipal Workers, does not make any pre-evaluation of the effects of overwork and mountaineering bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that are in place.
The region is so vast, social and health-related and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary a great deal by industry, by region and by employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already gained experience of, among other things, the close and basic care association Superin and the professional organisation of the social and health sector Tehyn, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather small.
JHL’s ban on overwork and mountaineering applies to, among other things, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are limited outside.
The fight at this stage affects almost 100 000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may last a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other labour-fighting activities if the preparation of the redundancy law continues.
The government should now admit that we are running against the wall and hard here.
According to Jalosen, both the Ay movement and the government must come against it.
It is special here that the difficulties are already in the pipeline, although the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Circle is born with the power of children and adults - in the fitness circuits of the show are studied the bones of the deer and the sea horse
The Great Choir Festival in Other Spaces took place last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltala.
Like the previous works of the group, The Great Choir is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a more detailed presentation will also be constructed, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
In theatre games, hundreds of magic is enough for child actors as well.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is still not a children’s show, but a show that adults and children do in co-operation.
It provides adults with information and observations on how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw in exercises and joint cuts also resolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Circle is somewhat reminiscent of the Sabbath ballet, gymnastics and natural subjects, but ultimately it revolves around visits in different, inhumane conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins by getting to know the movements of corals and coral reef living animals and fish.
In six different fitness classes, we teach, among other things, the bones of a deer and a sea horse.
Finally, an hour-long performance will be made, in which music, lights, and shiny paintings and clothes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both diving people watching the life of the coral reef and the corals being examined.
In addition, there are coral-watching creatures.
The many-directed views and observations make the show dense and life-shattering.
Whether it's a landscape of one life, a landscape-viewing life, and another life-viewing life or a landscape - and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult at all.
In other areas, the group strives with its exercises to the limit of thinking and action, to which getting caught when a group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, the Sitrator will hold a silent demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals.
The destruction beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to be arduous, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of practicing compassion in the face of the prospect of destruction.
In other spaces, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through political life.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, whose wonder and play it enraptures the space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
Today’s children and young people are more responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time, younger and younger.
I think that children should have children throughout their childhood, and not interfere with their lives because of objects and sex, because others say they do too.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister on the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, this told about his sex experiences that night.
I could not imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that it is not allowed to touch the pillows and sex is an adult matter.
I hope that modern children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see younger and younger girls on Instagram, who are wearing makeup on their faces and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing images.
It's harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I was a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: The authorities told the government that the case of Airiston Helmi was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by YI, the Defence Police and Defence Forces visited to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation by Airiston Helmen is currently not linked to national security, but to organised crime, Yle said.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (kok), Chairman of the Supreme Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, this week the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily to be economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle, the material confiscated has so far not found evidence of a link to national security, but the investigation is only ongoing.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of Yle’s interviewees.
A week ago, large housing developments in the island of Turku and the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely an economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
The evening earlier this week drew up a case in which arguments are being made both on and against.
Video: Dream painting saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool's 100 percent start to the campaign came to an end, but it was still a more satisfying team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be the same year as Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran for a 1-0 win.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Election League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp came to West London at the same time.
The Reds had started the campaign with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk felt himself in control of his own field goal.
Chelsea, for their part, had a great Sunday League Cup win from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard got up from the bench to solve the match with a stunning solo performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the start.
In the 25th minute he bowled first in a small space with three-player Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard’s descent forward and sent it a perfectly weighted work of passage.
Hazard rushed a little to the side of the penalty area, but bombed from there a perfect left foot bet at the back.
The Polish brass player Alisson was a little slow in his fight and only got his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss was slightly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio R<0xC3><0xBC>diger cleared Mo Salah’s direction from the finish line.
In the second season, Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa also made it to the playoffs.
The goalkeeper quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the bottom to the corner.
On the other end, Alisson, on his throw, zeroed in on Hazard's pass.
The guests' best place came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmin with his focus.
However, the brass star’s rifle was aimed at country teammate David Luiz, who saved the headquarters of the hosts.
It didn’t last for the 89th minute, either, when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the assailant bombed it to the top of an undisputed bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also heavily involved in the championship standings with two points behind the top.
In the debate on the clock transfer, the pots are deep
I remember when, a decade ago, a magazine asked different Finnish influencers, which is shared by the Finnish people.
Juice Leskisen's answer was the only one: Nen-f<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>te.
Some of them have no end and some don’t.
The distribution line can be born anywhere, and here was one bidder.
Finland has made it possible in the EU to abandon the annual clock migration.
Many people agree that the movement of clocks twice a year has been the morning of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide which time to finish at the end: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This is also where the people can express their opinion on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The discussion is being held fiercely on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their own words to say.
With the influence of morning light on people’s well-being, and with the influence of daylight on people’s outdoor fishing, the defenders justify their position on the well-being of people.
Both sides have a strong supporter and a good argument.
According to studies, morning light rhythms a person’s day and gives freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better opportunities, for example, for autumnal pastures.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated to its hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but for our bad location on the north side of the globe we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical topic for discussion is that one’s own view is driven and the other’s view is strongly opposed.
The other party’s arguments are not being listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn the other person’s head.
That's where the screen goes.
The subject is extremely easy to argue with, because it does not require a lot of effort and, for reasons, a mutual feeling is enough.
In general, there is a sharp and equally infertile debate about similar types of things.
It is a pity that if the wrong choice is chosen, it is not appropriate.
And it also always offers a suitable suit if life feels like hell.
Josba fought for this goal without a guest win
Josba's first guest game in Saliband Divar produced three full points against Nurmon Jym<0xC3><0xA4>.
Josba left the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki home road with a 6-5 win (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo was still leading the score at the beginning of the third division, but Josba sought compositions and rounded the men in chains.
In time 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored 6-5 goals.
In both teams’ ice caps, decisive minutes were played on a level playing field.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenki (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of her birth.
Josbala has six points after three series rounds.
The next one will be O2-Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4> guests in two weeks.
200th Anniversary of the Church of Eno on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated on Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the burning of the church was a shock.
The church of Enon was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although no one would like to, the Church of Enon is now the oldest church in the parish of Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts today at 10 a.m. at Eno Church.
After that, we move to the congregation house next to the karjala holding table.
The program has all kinds of days, both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building with the guidance of Ari R<0xC3><0xA4>s<0xC3><0xA4>nen, a retired 37-year church master.
The birth of the church also marks the end of an era.
Already removed from use, a congregation house built in 1982 keeps its doors open today for the last time.
We are now in small rooms in a former town hall, says Markku Koistinen, a cabin attendant.
The church house was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has stood healthy in its place for 200 years already.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla’s government chief, charges were settled with $40 million
Tesla and Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, have agreed on a legal case with the SEC of the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being divested of the company he founded.
Musk is expected to continue as Tesla’s CEO.
Musk, on the other hand, has to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board for three years.
The company has to hire the chairman of an external government.
Musk is also subject to stricter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor Musk’s communications in more detail.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (around $17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and the damage to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, CEO of the SEC.
The incident began in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he may pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet instantly raised Tesla’s share price.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company’s other executives or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of mismanagement of investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced its challenge to the company and Musk’s law.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from operating under the management of the stock companies.
The SEC’s challenge stymied investors, and Tesla’s share went down sharply.
More than 800 people have been killed in Indonesia's tsunami and tsunami
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country’s disaster news agency AFP.
The number of fatalities is believed to be still increasing, as there is a middle ground to deal with the damage.
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake lifted a tsunami that attacked the town of Palu, on the island of Sulawesi.
Tsunami was given a warning immediately after the collision, but was quickly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least until now from Praya.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala, near the centre of the conflict, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already now many people are known to be dead.
Realistic requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the area of destruction today, urged soldiers to continue their rescue efforts day and night.
One of the centers of rescue efforts is a hotel in Palusa, which is believed to still be 50-60 people in ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said one person was found alive from the wreckage of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular hotel for business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy rigging equipment would quickly be required for the containment and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones who are missing.
Help, you in and around Palus.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer called in a Facebook group.
Politician's phone numbers leaked to rioters in Britain
Many British politicians became alarmed when their contact information was leaked to the public due to the app's lack of encryption.
Among other things, the interferences reached the minister’s phone numbers.
This was the application used at the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom meeting in the government.
For example, Brexit-driven environment, food and agriculture minister Michael Gove and former foreign minister Boris Johnson were subject to harassment.
Several members of the public were given distractions.
Due to the application’s lack of encryption, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party’s annual meeting.
The public could access the profiles by using the policy's email address, which was easily available online.
You were able to view and edit the material saved to your profile by logging in to your profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment and the title was offensive.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to Rupert Murdoch's picture.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles with these email addresses.
Then the sign-in can view the contact details of the profile person and maybe send messages on this behalf.
The meeting app made each reporter, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster said.
The Conservative Party's whistleblower apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supports data leaks.
The app was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party considers that it is not possible to trust the Conservative Party in security matters.
The Wall Suomi audience has a large number of Polish people cheering every week
The audience was attentive to the reactions of the studio community of The Wall Suomi.
The world’s fastest-growing U.S. format, The Wall, landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is described in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for description were exceptional, as the large 12 meters high walls of the format required space for the space.
During the initial period, the studio audience of the program, which was run as a Polish, was featured on social media.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether the studio might understand that the Poles are sitting in the Finnish game.
The head of the four domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, explains the matter to Iltalehte.
He says that in the studio community there are close players, other Finns, foreigners living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The general public is made up of international puppets in Finnish production, as well as the audiences of the The Wall sections described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional groups, which are used in the descriptions of different programs, the background of Sormunen.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, there are interpreters in the foreign-language studio who handle the translation.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simultaneous interpretation to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of leak there is being thrown, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was delivered in Danish domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved a few years ago in the Finnish descriptions of Talent in Finland.
He had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time, and he knew all that was said in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the Ring.
Japan's southern tycoon is heading toward the mainland - authorities warn of earthquakes and floods
The authorities shall also warn of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taifu Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been prevented and no information has been released so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so severe that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK General Radio, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and credit trains are at stops due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka in half a day in Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but it also allows heavy winds and rain.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to weather forecasters, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the <0xC3><0x85>ss fell even further
The early days of the fathers have been bad.
The sky was already almost the longest, when the team lost 3-6 to Vaasa Sport on Saturday (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori now have five consecutive losses, and the points from six rounds are in a total of two.
No defender of the Aces or player of the two lower chains has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
Against the sport, the audience was already reeling from the ball when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to worry about it, because we played poorly.
The performance of the second part in particular was a shameful one, Jarno K<0xC3><0xA4>rki told <0xC3><0x84>ssi, who made the 1+2 effort.
Of course, the sport was well-deserved.
The team had a game down on Friday, so it would have been thought to be visible in the making.
You may have seen it, but you didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors continued to increase
Mother of the day Pirkko Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen wonders the audience of the event in the view of the big hall.
Somehow it was thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017 the same time was held with the Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the public could even calculate a bit from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already clogged before ten, the sellers reported the end of the products, the news yard was previously sold more than 500 doses and Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen heard there was an increase in the number of cars.
Estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6000, Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen says later in the afternoon.
At five o’clock in the morning and afternoon, there was a lot of programming for families with children, which I think will attract them to a lot of places.
In addition, Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen estimates that the event will take even longer.
Sellers also curve to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year almost a hundred of the presenters, artisans, bakers and harvesters had arrived at the baker’s table.
Mother of the day, PIrkko Hyv<0xC3><0xA4>rinen loved the audience from the view of the room.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series Teija Kivinieme’s beautiful bread won a public vote.
There were 11 different types of bread at the children’s bread competition.
Marjatta Veps<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>inen, the winner of the Ruisleip<0xC3><0xA4> competition, spent the day in the marts’ circuit.
7 x most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the room to the spirit, create the right atmosphere for the decor and read the book without getting tired of the eyes.
Good lighting is worth the rain.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux sales and marketing manager Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a service to your eyes
The importance of enlightenment is growing, the more years of age are behind it.
With enough light, you can help with problems that come to many with age, as the accuracy of the vision decreases and more and more people suffer from hallucinations.
The need for light is also growing.
Sixty times the light needs three times more light than twenty times the light needs.
Therefore, the effects of light treatment and the characteristics of the lamp should already be respected for health reasons.
Good lighting will give you enough light, but don't spoil it, Jokiniemi suggests.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can choose.
There is a Japanese style that combines unsavory, Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colors, different tones of metal or ice cream, has grown into a boom.
The truth is fascinating in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show your personality.
At home, on the other hand, more is being invested now than before, and furniture has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want to customize your own home, even a bolder light with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, whose origin and designer are well-known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
Home does not necessarily acquire the latest trend lights, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, graceful and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and see you!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian striker after three games
KooKoo and striker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are falling apart.
The Canadian batsman played a total of three League games in the oranges without power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in the Red Star line-up of Kunlund and at KHL farm in VHL in Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to show an example in recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed to paper
Today, in addition to games, the special game movement Pelimies also recycles packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stone shop are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us will go for re-use.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula Oulu’s Pelimimer says.
As a soft material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Plastic dolls are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving to recycling materials in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It’s not a big problem to start recycling.
It also provides financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is re-used.
Recycling is a natural fit for Gamer’s operation, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Every fashion-conscious acquisition: One and the same shirt works in every suit
Classic clothing works from season to season in a different outfit than in a suit.
They create the basis of a good wardrobe with their versatility, because around high-quality classics it is easy to assemble different outfits at a discount.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knits.
This category also includes the black pole.
Made of natural material, black needles on half-shells can not be mistaken.
The garment can be combined directly with trousers, shirt and jeans, and around it can create a style of both a controlled housing and a tortoise.
The semi-trailer is suitable for both the young modern wearer and the classic refined style tour.
That's how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from gold-gray and wide-brimmed cotton trousers, black half-neck and grey ankle boots.
The classic half-moon together with the other classics, the blue-green scotch chest and the wine-red loafers, form a feminine and refined ensemble of residences.
Bring to the black half-neck by combining it with trendy outfits: jeans, high-heeled boots and thick sock pants.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of engaging in sabotage.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence service SVR or the military intelligence service GRU would have given up this mode of action.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya group: sabotage and research group.
The officials of the Soviet security service KGB in the western countries have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), the archivist of the KGB in the western part of the country.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRG groups for uniforms and accessories for cover operations of the Bundeswehr, railways, distilleries and road workers.
This trick was used by the Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police mellow gear, set up checkpoints for you from the peninsula to Ukraine, and drove Crimea away from their homeland.
Agents of the Cold War adults were hiding supplies for sabotage groups in the countryside that contained mines, explosives, lighters and means of communication.
In 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, which was blown up when authorities sprayed it with a glass of water.

TRUTH: Today on TV: The Spider-Man was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man’s own experiences.
The movie is based on them.
Everest is now getting its first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Korm<0xC3><0xA1>kur’s 2015 guidance tells us about the struggle for survival, which has been dealt with in a fruitful way.
Films and documents have been made about the tragedy in the past.
Real events are also going through in this case.
The world’s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced tour guides: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weather's guide.
Weathers's spirit may have saved the eye surgery carried out before he left Nepal.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost his sight, which is why the supremacy had to be abandoned.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never came back.
However, the battle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came up, he was mistaken and could not find his way back to camp.
When the man was found, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was put to death.
As a miracle, however, he still got to his feet and found others.
The worst-hit Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own happiness.
It is clear that, contrary to the different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the fellow pioneers also began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Today is celebrated the 200-year-old Church of Eno
Eno’s 200-year-old church is celebrated today at the church.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and the whole family’s feast was prepared for Sundays.
The celebrations began at the Eno church at 10 a.m. family fair, after which there have been antiques of a cattle holding table at the Eno congregation house.
The church was full.
517 people took part in the family event.
Eno church lord Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and give strength to the work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire of the church has touched many, and it was not sidelined at the 200th anniversary of the church of Eno.
The Church of Enon is now in a fire extinguished by the Church of Kiihtelysvara, the oldest Evangelical Lutheran churches in Joensuu.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the early morning, a pilgrimage was held in which a church destroyed by fire was silenced and commemorated.
Photos and videos: Medicani looked at its glory in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-like autumn storm swept through Greece on Saturday afternoon.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red alert to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
The video posted on Twitter shows how houses in the city of Kiato in the region of Corinth have suddenly appeared instead of the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been forced to transport floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnesian peninsula, severe winds caused heavy seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for weather reports and instructions from local authorities to be followed.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings heavy rain and even flood risk.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medics appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically on the September-October trails, when the sea temperature is still high.
The now-blown storm left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northwards and towards Europe.
There have also been refugee camps in Greece on islands such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps are limited in their ability to properly protect themselves.
During the summer, the areas destroyed by the fires in the Athens area also remain under the storm.
In Greece, my medicament also broke down last November.
You don't have to go to the sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on the islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even on foot, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
Such instructions have been shared by guides to a fair 3 500 in Greece for the Finnish holiday weekend through the Solar Trips.
The instructions will come in handy, as even the Zorbas storm, which is rising to the top of the quakes, is predicted to hit the Greek island this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can rise by up to 45 meters per second.
Heavy rain will increase the wetness of the weather.
According to the travel organisers, all passengers travelling to Greece from Finland via Sun Travel and Tui have been warned by text messages of strong winds.
In the air still the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert on solar travel communication, the worst things have been avoided in holiday destinations by Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and have risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Security ahead, let's go.
Supporting media journalist Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least Greece was still calm, he said on Saturday from the beginning.
Tuila currently has a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred travelers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos arrived on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodoks had the sun set and the temperature was 27 degrees, says Ikonen.
Zorbaks is expected to move on to the next Turkish giant, albeit slightly slurred.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and with our staff there, and have, for example, checked the number of Finns flying in Antalya Tuila, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Hussilla fully identical evening gowns in the finals - how they reacted to the situation
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-air evening dress.
Hussi says he bought a dress from Meslewi.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by the breeder Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their own similar outfits and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was busy preparing for her, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet runner in the finals, and he talks about the most prominent stars arriving.
Huss has a recent move behind, as he moved Friday from Kampi to J<0xC3><0xA4>tk<0xC3><0xA4>saare
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own working room, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi spent the holidays alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's use of the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected curious views of retirees
The runner-up and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Suomi final on a red carpet that she had enough to do with the radio tracks and Love Island Suomi pictures.
The rush has been sufficient even to the extent that Karvinen came to the final straight from Finnair’s flight.
I made and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
A change of clothes at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled out his make-up in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was interesting, at least in the eyes of others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his spaghetti as a Finnish scoundrel.
He also said that his experience has so far been groundbreaking.
Karvinen says he visited on Friday to decorate the program's singles.
It's kind of raw.
They are people’s real emotions, Karvinen describes the program’s singles emotions.
How do I make over-the-shoulder socks?
Three perfect examples of this
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in a different outfit than in a suit.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can be found.
A few years ago, the over-generation boots that rose to the top of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to its name, the boots that reach the top of the knee repeat as stylish from year to season.
Looks like boots share the opinions of users, but the bold model is worth a try, well - bravely.
In fact, over-the-counter soaps are suitable for any household size.
Whether it’s jeans, lace, tulle or jersey, the simple leather or artificial leather jacket of boots works.
The long boots look good in both festive and archery fashions.
Black over-the-shoulder boots are also very suitable for hemp housing sizes.
They suitably balance the femininity of a pink, floral pliers shirt and a hemp-like, wet-needle.
Delicious but autumn-style archiasu to a romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro-looking housing is made of long copper-brown velvet, over-the-counter soaps, earrings that show up, and nibble.
While over-the-top shoes have a certain level of refinement, they are also perfectly suited for casual everyday wear along with t-shirts, long shorts and even trendy flags.
It’s so easy and yet so stylish!
Two Robotic Cars to Start Trafficking in Espoo
They operated for the rest of the year and took on board passengers, the city of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi’s robot cars act as a bus simulator, as next spring in the area is intended to start traffic by robot buses.
The project will develop and pilot the year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
In the experiment, you will find out how the robot cars manage with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, traffic management manager.
For the first time, robot cars run completely automatically in the middle of other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is the responsibility of the passenger who is always seated on the wheels.
The vehicles sensed their environment at all times with several different sensors and assessed whether the roadway was free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected in the vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowmobile, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotics.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn on three days of the week: on Tuesdays at 13-15.30, on Wednesdays at 10-15 and on Thursdays at 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The robot car stops detecting the stop signs.
The most secure access to the driveway is from the station number 1 in Otakaare.
Mokoma group's bassist fell off the stage in the middle of a fight and injured
On its Facebook page, the Mokoma group reports about the surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone Theatre.
The Mokoma band’s performance at Tampere’s Pakkahuone received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu H<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>inen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling out the last piece of the evening.
The hummingbird's wrist was broken.
The band reports on the matter on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu hit the stage in the last song at the Pakkahuone yesterday and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a speedy recovery for the metal bridge!
The rest of the tour will be handled by a spare crew, read on the pages.
Fans of Mokomo are concerned about the image update, in which the bassist-Santu paints a plaster in his hand with a bed.
This news is expected, there was quite a lot of worry about how bad it was.
The ease is great, the bones will improve over time.
Take a stroll and make a quick recovery for Santu and continue the good tour for another band plus a restaurateur!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great show, but the promise to leave behind the ending of such a strong dramatic show? writes a fan.
Police supervise hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Mets<0xC3><0xA4>hallitus and the Finnish Risting Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department’s unit said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the control levels of hunting weapons and the allowable quantities of self-loading weapons used in channel fishing were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found during the inspection, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to request an unauthorized 12-day penalty.
In addition, the police blew up 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the parties dealt with five traffic violations in the criminal proceedings, once the police.
In summary, it can be said that hunters comply very well with the permit of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the control.
One hunter said, “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked permits.”
The Finnish Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn, along with other supervisory authorities.
Mykk<0xC3><0xA4>nen to go to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrian refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykk<0xC3><0xA4>nen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of future quota refugees to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from the Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Labour and Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in the process of conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a special emergency situation in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
In Finland, more people are selected for the upcoming group than there are in the quota, because in practice some are left unattended for various reasons.
There is also a long way to go for civil society organisations operating on the border between Turkey’s Interior Minister S<0xC3><0xBC>leyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, the Minister of the Interior’s Chief of Staff, is also on the way.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota had been for a couple of years for 1,050 years, but the government has since failed to agree to increase it.
The meeting has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen short of blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykk<0xC3><0xA4>sen’s visit is the first during this period of government, which the Minister of the Interior makes on-site to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former interior ministers Petteri Orpo (council) and Paula Risikko (council) managed to move into their new positions before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable position.
Now let's go to the polls - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Last Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article came to the view that the legislative proposal essentially prohibits the keeping of all animals which are not separately permitted by the regulations of the ministries in relation to production animals, pets or otherwise business activities.
Thus, everything else is strictly prohibited except for the animals referred to separately in the Regulation.
If the bill comes to an end, it means that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law separately prohibits activities that endanger the safety of society or a good way.
We are now basically regulating the prohibition of all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business and does nothing else, until an acceptable law or regulation has been passed.
In general, the government’s activity in the preparation of legislation has been weak.
If we now go on the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not separately allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this bill does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will adopt such a 'everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately' procedure.
I hope there will be a sensible minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell hints: Autumn’s four trendiest hams
This autumn’s trend dress comes in snake boxes.
It looks especially good in the shirts.
Combine the serpentine shirt into a pair of more restrained tops, such as a half or a regular t-shirt, to keep the overall look stylish.
This autumn silk is visible a lot and especially silk beard is one of the trendiest pieces of clothing in the season.
Combine the gorgeous silk skirt with the feminine top or relax as a pair of knits.
With a silk shirt, you can play more boldly and throw your feet, for example, sneakers or autumn trend shoes cowboy boots.
It doesn’t matter if it’s grey, brown or multi-coloured, all of the ribbed skirts are now part of every woman’s black garden swimsuit.
Courageously combine different colors with each other and play with the board pieces also on the different sections at the top.
For example, the combination of a square piece and a ball piece is beautiful.
Asymmetrical beads are a breeze of summer lightness, which can be taken with you in autumn.
The asymmetric helmet is both feminine and playful and fits perfectly with both the bow and the party.
Alexia baby, 3 months, crushes sweetly in jere's lap
In the family portrait of the Karalahti, a sweet three-month-old baby Alexia rises in the spotlight.
Nanna Karalahti tells Kerava about Real-Day Homes.
Traffic entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family bonus at the beginning of July.
The couple’s first son, Jax, turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Recently, Nanna Karalahti and Martina Aitolehde had training camp in Marbella, Spain, with the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, in which she poses for the entire family of Karalahti.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
Pay attention to the sweet-smelling baby Alexia, who is resting on Jere's arm.
Thank you for this.
Thankful for kindness, forgiveness, people’s generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes alongside the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti recently went to the daycare business and opened a Real-Day Home for Kerava.

Johanna Tervo was hired as the director of the daycare centre.
Turkey is urged to charge mobile phones in the event of a storm
The storm, which erupted in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned on Saturday, especially seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country, about the Greek storm, according to CNN T<0xC3><0xBC>rk.
The tropical storm is said to pass along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
The disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functioning of internet connectivity so that people can get up-to-date status updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People are encouraged to stay at home and away from windows, as well as, for example, to move garden furniture away from the wind.
In Turkey, heavy rain is expected and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
The Red Weather Warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red alert to the regions of the Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The foreign ministry and travel agencies in Greece have warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were asked to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and rain.
The people were very calm, communication manager Laura Aaltonen from the travel agency Tui told STT on Saturday.
Aalton described the situation as similar on Saturday evening.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from the Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, the ships did not operate on Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship transport were expected.
On Saturday, Finnair was told that the weather situation was being actively monitored.
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen crystallized the reason for Mercedes’ right-hand drive compared to Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen was able to admit that Mercedes’ worst competitor was too hard a part in the times of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic at the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our cars were at times the best for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth, and R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, who was clearly left with his teammate Sebastian Vettel, said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
We were asked about the reason for the sudden fall of the Mercedes wheels.
They seem to be moving faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is a constant guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
At times, there was a rare taste for the future Sauber of R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrari in the first half of the season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson was also in the final season.
For Sweden, the 10th seed is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second half only five drivers were left out completely, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging thinking about the future of R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>s?
Yes, if compared to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
Next year is a different story, so let’s see, let’s see.
It was in it - Robert Helenius shouted Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart in the evening went on in a straight line.
The German was a more initiatory party in the circle, but he did not get a proper result.
Clearly more extensive, Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which were well received.
The Finnish was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth instalment, when Helenius tore the left straight to Teper.
The impact was so severe that the contestant in front of the home crowd didn’t even try to get up from the mat.
After the victory, Helenius fanned quite moderately.
In the body-challenge, he initially encouraged the audience to create a good atmosphere and his opponents.
Then he switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and to all the fans.
We took the belt with us today.
Helen was happy right after the game.
It was a big win for Helen’s career.
There might be a chance to even get into the World Cup, Helenius commented to the club before the match.
Instead, the loss could have been decided by the entire box office.
Of course it's happened in my mind.
This is no longer the case for younger people, as 34-year-old Helenius admitted before meeting Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can be multiplied
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice president is calling for a clear increase in the number of victims.
The country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficulty conditions
Rescuers are searching for the injured as well as the injured from the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city and its neighbouring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the ruined buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palusa is sorted.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of the wounded, but the lack of armor has delayed the start of rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to be rescued and looted.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area, electricity and telecommunications connections are broken down in many places.
Fuel supplies are also on the rise.
Miss Suomi’s dubious response and long-term thinking led to a laugh.
Billn<0xC3><0xA4>s Ruuk is currently selecting a new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, a question was posed to each of the finalists.
The finalists asked the question of the glass ball on the stage.
In particular, the finalist of the number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, received a suspicious response in the audience during the time of the sweet but benevolent laughter.
The question posed to Antikos came through Facebook.
Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the last book the Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before the doubts began.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
The audience was given an opportunity to laugh until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is one of economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a flurry of applause from the audience with a smile on his face.
In the past, Anttikoski drew attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela S<0xC3><0xB6>derholm resigns from the crown.
Sikki apple pie cake takes the language to the past
This recipe is for those of you who have good, acidic omelets on your back, as the homemade apple is in the store for shocking prices.
You may need to buy a headboard, although a lot of people already grow that headboard.
This cake can also be made only from omelets if you do not want to buy the main course.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake is also stuffed with its main course.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seeds.
Viipaloi.
You can melt in a pot.
Pour the eggs and sugar into foam and then add to foam corn powder and melt butter.
Combine the cornstarch, i.e. the flour and baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add the almonds and wheat flour, mix well.
Peel the breadcrumbs with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the breadcrumbs and spread on top of the sugar.
Read half of the dough on top of the main slices and apple slices on top of the dough.
Read the rest of the dough on the apple slices.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool down for a year and then cancel the service.
Cut the cake until well cooled.
The cake is fragile in its structure and crumbles easily, because the dough contains almond and corn flours that do not contain gluten.
An international crime-crime event will be held in January.
For the first time in January, Kuusamon Ruka will host an international literary festival focusing on Nordic criminal literature.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related programme numbers as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include Swedish literary star Jens Lapidus and Swedish writer Erik Axel Sund, who is behind the name Jerker Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to the Swedish names, the event also sees writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo’s unique environment provide the framework for a unique written experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts in favor
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have analyzed the matter by describing two types of “coolness”: generally attractive coolness and, in turn, the opposite of second-guessing coolness.
Curiously cool people, according to the researchers, had many socially desirable traits: they were outgoing, friendly, fit, and qualified.
For second-guessers, in turn, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and fragility.
They fed up with the experience and only cared a little about external evaluations.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of covid is no longer cool: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 U.S. study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who were dating early, dating, looking for good-looking couples, and seeking the favor of others, as a young adult, had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes.
In their human relationships, they were less able to cope than in the past, with their most inconspicuous peers.
High-status-messaging readings, handbags, or watches don’t make a person cool – or at least a truly enticing companion.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more likely to be friends with their regular market shirt than with their branded shirt - despite the fact that most people still chose their branded shirt in the dating situation.
If you are on a holiday in Greece, be careful!
There's a thunderstorm hitting there - weather warning shouts red
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland, on average, for half a year.
The Zorbas-Hymur storm strikes Greece over the weekend.
If you are staying in the Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete, make a reservation.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Enlargement, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red alert to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca blog.
According to the storm, the heaviest blizzards are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma-myrsky peaked at just 31 meters per second in Finland from the start of the week.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm, however, is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
On weekends, more than 300 millimetres of water can be reached in Southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the Zorbas storm caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the death of men on Love Island Finland -Ankun?
Appears in Disturbing Youtube Videos
Rarely do you know that in the Love Island Suomi series, the beauty of many men killed by Anku also appears in strange Youtube videos published in 2010 as a cartoon.
In videos, Anku advises the soldiers to produce, among other things, a black fish from an old economic paper roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how a silky squid can be bred with an ashtray, for which the right spikes are grown.
Now let the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints and presents the sachapura, sock pants and raisin seeds, from which he makes the silt.
You can watch the videos below or the Ankun Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and burst the adrenaline in Sochi - will he become Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas hit a little more than a dozen minutes after the Russian GP’s pole position when he was in front of the media.
The great lap was left behind by Mercedes’ first-seeded Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a critical one for the Finnish team this season.
Nice turn.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left between the rounds.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas explained.
I’ve only been on the pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so it’s been a while.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good laps again.
It is not easy to cross the Sochi line, so the starting point is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he is going to win tomorrow or whether Hamilton is going to win the World Cup.
My starting point in the race is definitely that I try to win.
There can be no other goal on the way out, Bottas paddled.
But as numbers, we're fighting for both championships.
The leadership of Lewis at Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so it has to be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas is your complement.
Hamilton was really happy with Bottax’s success after the race, and the Mercedes tallipomo Toto Wolff also had a taste.
Lewis had the intention to defeat Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the ambush.
Valtteri knows he has to revitalize everything on his own to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff sneezed.
Asked whether the stable would allow Bottax and Hamilton to drive the ferry, Wolff replied to the argument.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteel<0xC3><0xA4>inen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars ended rarely.
Almost never before have the brothers become the champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in the decision rally driven in the surroundings of Turku and Salon, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteel<0xC3><0xA4>inen Erno Kinnunen confirmed the best achievement of his career when the third place in the decision-making process sealed him with the SM4 class of two-wheeled cars of the Finnish championship.
Honda Civic’s Kinnunen and Ville M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4>, a map reader, started the competition in Turku, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group returned the SM title.
In the dark on Friday night, the pair had to give a balance when some of the extra lights were turned off by another special test.
It was meant to be a time of shock for a third time.
In such a situation, it is not suitable for hunting.
On Saturday, only the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is “nearly over.”
In his speech at the United Nations, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home.
There is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a Syria meeting is planned for October, in addition to the participation of the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the highest court drama on TV
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of harassment, got an exceptionally large number of people next to the screen.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s full-fledged Supreme Court nomination drama drew at least 20 million people next to its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s appointee and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were telling his story in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online hearings, several million more followed.
NBC reported that the livestreams were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it made its year-long record with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN’s number will rise to more than 10 million, according to the report, which said it has tracked the broadcasts via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are channel’s own, TV viewing figures come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case stunning.
Rarely more than 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only access sports competitions as well as the world’s major Oscars and Grammys, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, the Super Bowl is a trip to the finals of the American Football League’s most watched annual program.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC’s side of the screen.
Last year, Mr. Trump’s first speech to Congress saw a total of nearly 48 million people and 30 million people serving as officials.
A matter of utmost importance
The designation of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, as the offices are of a lifetime.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was, in a number of questions, a so-called Wai language, whose voice could resolve the position of the nine-member court.
He was a supporter of the rights of abortion and sexual minorities and, for example, decided in 2015 by voting that same-sex couples were granted the right to marry throughout the state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative on his canoes.
His election to the Supreme Court may include the right to a conservative power for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information from parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the situation of the Kanta service was even more worrying at first: parents were not able to see even the health data or prescriptions of small children.
The situation was subject to a temporary correction in the autumn of 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
After that, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but the correction has gone amazingly long.
Now the repair is allowed - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change to the legal basis should not have been more than a cause for perjury.
After that, the understanding of the painter is about pressing the button: when the bar is now held, it is opened.
The child can, of course, show his or her information to his or her parents - if he or she has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
The ID card is payable, and the 10-year-old does not even receive bank IDs.
In practice, the four-class data of the secondary school can not be seen by anyone other than asking for them printed.
It is not about the rights of parents as it is about the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be taken care of.
Even the underage can have family situations in which not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they relate to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply important human right.
In the U.S., the FBI began to collect charges against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment allegations.
One of the women earlier this week was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his time at school.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation should not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more limited investigation, and it does not necessarily go public.
Man threatened to kill police at police station in Kajaan
The attached scrubber continued polishing even with the camera.
Police say they put the man in the police prison to "rest".
The police were threatened by a suspected perpetrator on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official reports on the case that got its start when a fair 30-year-old man fiercely challenged a fight in a central restaurant.
The man first talked about another customer inside the grocery store.
This was followed by the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by throwing him on the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man hit him again.
A three-way investigation led to a call from the police.
The party arrested the man and took him to Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect was still acting aggressively in the police station.
The man shot another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill the police, and he threatened to harm the police.
Police say he passed on to the man's police prison to "comfort".
The man is suspected of three counts of abuse and of violent opposition to the official.
Aid organisations prepare to start work in Indonesia's Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF’s Chief Information Officer.
Local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people from the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue operations are underway in Sulawesi, but the situation in the Donggala area is a little more northerly.
There are still places where connections don’t work.
Aid measures are difficult, because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often light-weight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the remains have been found, they need protection - from the beginning, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
First of all, most people are able to offer water-cleaning tablets, which are also in stock with UNICEF.
Water systems are being repaired as soon as possible, but in case of an emergency, water is first transported, for example, by rivers.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and connecting families is a part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the early stages of emergency assistance, funds previously collected are used.
Among other things, however, UNICEF has already started a fundraising campaign to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits as chairman of Tesla's government - $20 million in tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by signing an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his job as chairman of Tesla’s government and agrees to pay $20 million in fines.
Musk claims his role as part of a deal he signed with the U.S. Securities Regulatory Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk over a securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In it, Musk wrote that he is preparing to pull Tesla out of the stock exchange, which led to a rapid rise in the company’s share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla’s board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and take two "independent managers" to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will continue to serve as Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fines, Tesla will also have to pay $20 million in similar fines to the financial controller.
Twiats lead investors astray
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to Billionaire’s tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla’s share price rose after tweets by more than 10 percent a day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He had also not discussed the stock exchange’s withdrawal with another management group or the company’s board.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell by 14 percent when the SEC’s securities regulator announced a fraud charge.
Upon the agreement of the news, it is expected that the company will confirm the course again.
The last sentence is not the reason.
The clocks of the cathedral do not naturally ring when the wise men do not move.
This is a technical error.
The clock on the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Visas show at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a medium horror film: even when the crypt of the church belonged to the monastery and the urns would sound to themselves.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it is broken.
It has been visited by the repairman to see, but some part has been broken and a new part is expected to do so, says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the position already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account states that the last judgment is not a reason to stop the clock.
James says the church clocks don't ring because of the error.
