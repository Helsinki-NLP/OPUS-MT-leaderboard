Members of the National Assembly for Wales feared confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is discouraging.
The reason for this is to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name “reigns with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, “twp” stands for “doof” and “pwp” stands for “Aa”.
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party said the entire group was "unhappy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a name change law, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name “Welsh Parliament” emerged for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred the committee, while in a public hearing the option “MWP” found the greatest support.
The National Assembly members seem to suggest alternative options, but calling for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may, in their debate on the law, vote definitively on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province of the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is on the Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its admission into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I talked to said in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was traceable.
“The social life of people today looks different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people who do not support the remaining refuges live.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these condominiums will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church, which maintained its worship services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was heavily damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who sounded the bell in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been drawn in part by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the diocese of Bishops.
In July, the municipal council – the governing body of the municipality consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns over the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal council, even though it was not responsible for the commissioning of the architects appointed by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-old diving into lobsters
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark reportedly attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone had been torn up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's is engaged in boats, superdrugs and debenhams with cosmetics departments that are dedicated to shopping malls.
As part of a major boost to the 2.8 billion pound UK cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches across the country will be tested.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used retail space for televisions, microwaves and household goods in other ways.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics range doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is carrying out a relaunch of its “Boutique” make-up series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will also be testing at two Sainsbury’s retail outlets, the first in Croydon, South London, last week, and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, which will open later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily shopping for small amounts of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos retail outlets since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, as well as a number of Habitat retail outlets, which has increased food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but it ended after a discussion about the distribution of proceeds from the drug dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 branch pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in terms of adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases, questioning the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones 'wrong' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “wrong” after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones for her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new affiliations with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “wrong” when the “Golden Girl” of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, added, due to their new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – to the common home-and-access-time non-profit.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would have probably doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Trily had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure its future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market launch.
At headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business matters.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said the voice of a news moderator mimicking:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
About three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no “responsive” U.S. response to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States held on to sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
In his announcement speech, Trump proved to be much more optimistic.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: the end of the missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the deadly remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster protection agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami protection shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a daily sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning that came into effect, probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already an optimal challenge.
Due to natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complicated.
A Lazarus ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the impacted Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko, which is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to ongoing confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0:1 rebound at about 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the back post.
The gun sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always playing as much as possible forward, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led Hazard in the quarter-finals with 1-0 in the 25th minute.
The Blues stormer gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned around near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the middle.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended up with a left-handed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back into the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the disaster protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that were set to collapse by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves up to six meters high, the official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a Dashcam to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s next relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that now the whole area is being treated as a torture.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene of the incident.
She repeats over and over again, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vehicles were inside the lock and another vehicle before the lock.
Within the lockdown stood several police officers who were monitoring the residential block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and refer to protocol entry 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument to the controversy over the rewriting of history
Her banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The image storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century ruling opinion and part of the history of a character that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is being defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who views parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely valid presentation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, known only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is preparing to inject swine vaccines.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stable was open.
He said a large male pig with blood on its tail had been found in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram-heavy pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News as “Wu.”
Shots of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram-heavy pig stuck a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to move the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to sneeze and are very curious, ... they are not about to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Bring Widespread Heavy Rain to the Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on its way over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding-causing rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 am East Coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough over the Pacific begins to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity produces widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the incoming trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall can cause dangerous fluctuating floods, water-driven debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flu-like flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of the threatening tropical rains, it is strongly advised to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can lead to rippling currents from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local gusts as well as wind that leads to dust.
The nearby trough brings local heavy rains to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris driving in the water and to smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners region and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, in the middle of the US, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
Over the next few days, the constant summer heat tries to re-develop and expand.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers have watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million viewers watched the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political pact situation persisted, and on Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement negotiated by Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona that would allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, that she was depressed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company measured the average viewership at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To put this into perspective: This corresponds to roughly the number of spectators in a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day listening.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters loudly pushed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood there for minutes with his eyes lowered as he was being trained, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the continuation of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote in the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so under the condition that the FBI, like the Democratic minority, will investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake is partly convinced by negotiations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, exploit Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will join the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with her other interview published on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “chequers plan” for Brexit by presciently dismissing a proposal that would mark the reciprocal imposition of tariffs by the UK and the EU as “oily.”
Deadly shootings at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge police for the murder.
The authorities released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA had been found on the glasses.
After a Simpsons poll, the police said he was standing on Wayde's fatal shot.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal engineering lab of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" about Wayde's death and "stands in shock".
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcanoes spit ash on Mexico City.
Thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl, the southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grueling and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017 had shaken an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in central Mexico, detected increased activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the readiness police, threw eggs at them and also smeared paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the next day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” while they were confronted by Unionists who shouted “Long live Spain”.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
However, one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid saw as illegal, was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the voter turnout was low, as opponents of the split boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in front of the polling stations in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped outside over night on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in the self-imposed exile or in prison, where they are imprisoned on their part.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been shrouded by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to promote the degradation of democratic values and the suppression by the Spanish government is by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, he may have been shot on the car with an armrest.
Menga match means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s hit proved crucial for Gary Holt’s team to equalize with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team will remain undefeated in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has been able to increase his division win streak to six games in the meantime, meaning head coach Holt has not yet recorded a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chance against free-kicking guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead for a long time before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in front of the most diverse problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down before the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after being knocked in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate was created.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson together put Menga in a shooting position, which shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but were unable to overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely untouched.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dropped the ball from another standard situation in Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly made their way into Livingston's penalty room and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks - one from Halket against the replaced Glenn Middleton and one due to handplay - were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have once again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Her playing style and team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt has been very praised for the way he has stirred the team up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was great and led an excellent organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the host team – and that’s kind of like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany that should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s EU accession.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police called security reasons that she was holding a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see her president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, praised by some German Turks as a hero and ridiculed by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred around 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and health workers took care of the man who died at the crash site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with a driver’s flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Roadblocks and reroutes for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the unrest involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on-site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to remedy an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and possibly spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated by a convict in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, prison officials were called in to deal with serious riots in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flu-like flooding (Dry areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull across the desert-infested southwest and carry the risk of flu-like flooding with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of fluctuating floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and walk straight across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall with individual up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-infested southwest including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and individually possible up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flu-like flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain will in part be likely to be useful, as droughts are currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move 19 kilometers per hour to the north.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north across Mexico, reach the Arizona border in the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then until late Tuesday night through Arizona to the south of Utah.
"As the main danger associated with Rosa or her remains, very strong rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-infested southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening fluctuating floods and water-driven landslides are expected in the desert, as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murders
After finding a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is “stable”.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who have records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the community, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the community, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said in front of Congress on Thursday and dismissed the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually molested them decades ago when both were teenagers.
During the hearing, Ford also said he was indicted.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the public,” he said of the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not acting, but in reality I’m acting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday in the Senate, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, death toll rises
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of them drowned when giant waves hit the beaches as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat came from the tsunami yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster protection agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it was swimming cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit land all,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centres in Palu.
Air footage released by the disaster protection agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released from Friday’s massive quake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the rubble of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was totally paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves reportedly came at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperate for calls warning people on the street beneath him from the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall powers the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief measures.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the town of Palu, where the employees are housed in tents in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, came across scenes of the devastation on the way.
“They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to put disaster relief in place, some of them agreed that expert foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, deliveries and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
“At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell over Palu from Friday, friends and family members of those still missing hoped for one of the wonders that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in a row for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the start of this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior at paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders made the round, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who took part in the beach party.
However, his messages only led to gray question marks instead of blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 from a cash machine.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a sack full of money destined for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Individuals who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known Kanye West being).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for “emotional reasons.”
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning in its own words for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously worked, has already written his name with and without dashes and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, while left-wing student movements were setting up across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the U.S., we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success in the U.S. would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China office.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the academic top powers, it’s companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years hired coryphies from universities to work at AI.
According to Lees, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that people who are AI-promoted should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee’s words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to donate funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to be a partner in industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on a change to the country's name
The population of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would add a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim raises on the Greek territory, which is why Greece has vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign calls into question that the electoral participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will give up their vote in the referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be for this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would agree with “yes.”
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its takeover in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defence to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentinian attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him having to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net shortly before dropping out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game for the Rockies
Since the Nationals are out of the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the always high-powered joker hopes to stand up against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would face this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to have jokes thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th entry as a starter, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
This season, the Washington right-hander has an 18-7 stats, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump Holds Announcement in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh he selected for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t play, but in reality I play, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the community, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission in “resisting and blocking.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “disgusting and common and abhorrent and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud applause from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document get out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer accepting all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to taunt me, it came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy and former top politicians had no opinion.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, “The meetings should all be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised “friendly, more cautious” policy has long since been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is assessed as to whether it is accepted by the party's top.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues with whom I had previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it with regard to national security or the European Biennale.
Whenever I speak in public – no matter what I say – there is a social media junkyard that calls for my election, which appeals to the political center and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily flood of sexist or racist abuses and still never give up small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that bullying has become a normality.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to be applied, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I have often been advised over the past two years to pull my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, then I would “have no problems”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, on the basis of which my classroom literally broke apart in the whole school, I have been in need of better public services for those who need it most as a minister.
I have never made a mockery of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of the Friday request, I would just like to say this: given the fact that the country is going to crack down on a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be afraid of so many electoral threats or political considerations that will be of your best interest in all of my own.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance advantage, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they have used their chances better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, failed to let the numbers speak, and Jason Bagh<0xC3><0xB6> Verggot caught a
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before he scored a hit right at halftime and then scored an increased try in the innings so it stood at 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
A longer interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the field, and after the continuation, Ayr extended his lead by an increased attempt by Clemo by Stafford McDowall.
Then Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose let the additional man pay for an unencumbered attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored from the penalty kick from a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a switch to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “floating restaurant business.”
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia’s land-locked hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Matrosen patrols in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, decorated with scuba gear.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
To win it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in the country-infested Bolivia, the memory of a bloody conflict over resources lost to Chile in the 19th century is still as vivid as the desire to ride across the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be approved on October 1 after five-year consultations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s judgment on big screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim, according to which, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivian Me.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is due to fight for his re-election next year, the verdict on Monday is also much at stake.
“We are just about to return to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not authorized to claim Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the IGH’s ruling was already six months after the final plea was filed, concluding that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has torn apart the question of access to the sea itself,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She suggested that Morales's warlike rhetoric stifled any remaining goodwill from Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their talks, but after these events, this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision fell unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139-year-old dispute to the mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political crux.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement in action the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore, seems to be just ahead of reinstating the de facto nuclear diplomacy.
Ri called the idea that further sanctions and the U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North into its knees as a “brain spinner.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement, without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the runway a palette of crazy oversized head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the runway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other over-sized accessories include jewelry-filled watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were provided with raised lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream bag.
And if you want to put on another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimetres wide edge, all worn by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit big waves on social media, sent another big creation across the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the one wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bastbag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather heel was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus’ summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be available on the shopping streets next summer. The designer has so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to stand out for academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools as elective subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you’ll reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages with the highest survival rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A during the higher exams.
According to data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72% of students in Mandarin achieved the grade A during the higher exams, while 72% of students who learned German, 69% of students who learned French, and 63% of students who did not learn French.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as STEM subjects (sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems in public employment were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such lifelong ability in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct an interview, and French was spoken as the only language by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered the most important for the UK in terms of 2020 such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, a number of languages with correspondingly specialized teachers will always be available at independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future may look like.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still essential for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication capability.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James join the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet fixed.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after training for his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season play schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trump's announcement in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is Trump’s first of five announcements scheduled for next week, including in places he feels comfortable with, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the swirling vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court for the vacancy, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s announcement in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can follow Trump’s announcement in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation will remain in swing for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
The main goal of this series of announcements, however, is to support Republicans who have to face a difficult November election.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five announcements next week serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Controlling Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible while the busy campaign season is nearing,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name his name told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and media reporting from Pittsburgh” could participate in the announcement planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
Saturday’s visit is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows readiness to fight to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like these.
So where is the momentum in your opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a small moment for us,” Jordan Spieth said as he left the pitch.
Europe is of course at the advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can score three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the finish to the green and goes forward with a good example.
The benevolent cheers became louder in the course of his round as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had fallen behind after two holes with two points.
His putt, which chose the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really have to get sober and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, making the history of the Ryder Cup no doubt.
Europe’s odd but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who didn’t beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey’s on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly endless amount of energy between them underscores that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s fourth hero who played alongside Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a clamp they could not closely overcome.
On Sunday, no one will be able to help them.
The fours and fours are so fascinating to look at from close up due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change rapidly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four round has also shown that the team of the United States is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is 10:6 ahead after Saturday’s four and four games against the United States and takes a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods, scoring four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four in the morning against the failing American team and won the series by 3:1.
In the four games, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but were unable to recover the remainder.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four consecutive points as the first European rookie, while he and Molinari, who were named after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening match.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5&4.
Woods, who had been drawn by two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 games after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point deficit, but as the title holder for Furyk's team, a draw was enough to keep the trophy.
Since they’ve only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust around the house
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant action" last year out of goodwill, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and committed not to deter nuclear weapons and technologies.
“But we don’t see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not arm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phasic” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, he repeated his statement in so far as it seemed significant that a unilateral denuclearization could not have taken place from the outset.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had assured the North Koreans to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump assured North Korean security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a loosening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “first denuclearization” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even against the “explanation of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brain-spinner of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not be up to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
However, the tone of Ris speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea with missiles to the mainland of the United States after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened last year with the “complete destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no timeframe for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case be continued vigorously until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made only to be accused of North Korea hours later, he had made “gangster-like demands.”
This month, North Korea pledged to build a missile base and nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon when the United States took “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he sought were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course to life after holding a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University’s health services, said the university has opted for the introduction of the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the image of a room in a home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books, where they receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university grounds, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine with interactive symbols.
“We know that it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of “sliding a layer of night” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient good sleep, the “secret weapon” of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and a weight gain could also be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course. He had taken one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar degree program before taking up their studies at a competitive university.
According to the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should be alert to sleep time and waking time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor beats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrard's unmatched team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first away win since the 4–1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the distance-leading Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the poor Rangers didn’t seem to have a chance to make up for it.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third place and is only behind Hibernian.
The Rangers are also at risk of further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object seemingly thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week, and would have to be thrilled as his well-trained team kept their opponents on pace and under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They were supposed to score a goal after just two minutes, when Menga's first goal led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot away.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour he should have received a penalty due to a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but District Judge Steven Thomson did not let the Colombian's complaints apply.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a eighth shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not have corresponded to the game's course, there is no denying that they had earned it alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a ball shot by Jacobs during a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and picked Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the switch almost immediately took effect when the winger Morelos came into position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, kept the guests playing exactly the game they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow kicked a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a late penalty kick after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: “Actually, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
During treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to recognize degenerate cells.
In the method, a patient's immune cells are removed, which are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a many types of cancerous protein in common and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancers common protein HER2 and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken out of immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance at SNL and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was interviewed at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widely praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wants to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town" and wearing a make-America great-again cap, he continued with a smear canon against the Democrats and once again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by Whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's comic strip was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock wanted to have fun with the West release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the stage due to his head covering.
“They’ve been harassing me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out with the cap.”
You've been harassing me!
And then they say I’m in a slumped area,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “I’m going to wear my Supermancape because that means you can’t tell me what I’m doing.
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered at least twice the public outcry, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported, one person told the magazine: “It was deadstill in the studio.”
West had been hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a performance of the title "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, and tweeted: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ENJOYED BY THE MASSE.”
However, talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes himself a bad ideology for my community and gives himself nothing (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known Kanye West being).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course, Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

The allegations are being reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manliness
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, he said such roles on the screen would result in boys often having the feeling of having to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31, who was also involved in "Game of Thrones", admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
“I personally think the question is very important at the moment, what went wrong with manhood,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now watching?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For with the young men, something has clearly gone wrong.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones".
From November, Harington is seen in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about “Game of Thrones” was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so this is how I got to know my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The two married Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sex trafficking.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
The transmission of HIV through sex trafficking is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters disputes that employees leaked the GOP senators’ data, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, disputed claims on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Los Angeles Democrat expressed the opinion that the claims of “ultra-right-minded” experts and websites would be spread.
“Lies, lies and even more hideous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday during the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges of sexual misconduct brought against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for sifting through this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This demention is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they did not do should not be angry.
You must not be shy.
You must not question the defendant’s motives.
You have to be calm and relaxed.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics during the hearing on Thursday of having been too angry.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Criticism of “Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Shook it” – and English with “Jenny” in 2011.
Will an ironic self-parody on the issue of how obviously we are being bullied become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glottis-eyed, Grimassen-cutting and incompetent Johnny English for mixing was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the belligerent secret agent, who strangely considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he is out of something Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a tick of this guy who has a single note on the title melody of "Die Sturgeon" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind the retreating travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
Johnny English’s last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were briefly tilted to his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy comes in handy, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the “serious” film series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of the Bean.
The eternally current premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the dismay of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure who is already standing before the total collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with.
Their intelligence advisors inform them that all active spies have been exposed and therefore they need to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy institution, but there is unofficial instruction in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terribly wrong in the secret service of your majesty, are back in action, while they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful female Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is threatening to ban a charismatic tech billionaire, the shadowy Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: As waiters, they set on fire a chic French restaurant, they worry about chaos when they sneak aboard Voltas luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to make himself at home with the help of a Virtual-Inn-Realis
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but no matter how sympathetic and funny they are, the topic is already discussed in detail in children's television.
Quite moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?”
Labour disputes working on a plan, after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution in the form of an additional day off to the workers.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea “fits” the party’s economic agenda and plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of the workers.
The move to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the workers, as well as with the party’s overall industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party at all.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made concrete his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” from public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cash out annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in the news magazine "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the agency could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something up to date, which could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this statement was made, and asked if he had done so.
He was determined, determined, and incomprehensible."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently disputed this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those who called her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the seventh time this year, to not only experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to perform a number of tasks. This includes actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the target audience.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen will still be 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert in the future, a sensible way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen said the project has been able to list more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among some of the most important commitments is the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to get more from undernutrition in the country than they did from the 4th.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of The Power of Nutrition project, which is expected to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizens can combat extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and exhausting path with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will be successful as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year’s New York event, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. Could Use Navy for Blockade Purposes to Prevent Russian Energy Exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington's review, Washington can resort to the navy if needed so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets, and Russia is currently working at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new sales markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea lanes remain open and block them when needed to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, referring to Russia as a “One Trick Pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was in the process of expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unreasonable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, with which Trump said Berlin became “captured” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, to be an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received backwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” the BDI’s board of directors, Dieter Kempf, said after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Exactly Review” a 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Says Senator for Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check" a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "exactly examine" a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is directing this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf out of her mouth in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that prior to the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy from former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent advocating a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats who question a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, can all be traced back to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back, that they are coming back more quickly, that they are coming back and wondering if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military has given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support legal aid for the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy to the new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court-appointed statement Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeal decision that allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignored decades of legislation at the state, state and international levels.”
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s attorney said in a statement.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that deny immigrants access to the country have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be more likely to act as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges, who fled domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs, no longer grant asylum.
“Asylum exists for anyone who leaves their home country because they are being persecuted or out of fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people have to contend with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as death toll doubles over time in the race
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their wettest possessions and goods and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
U.S. Ambassador Complains China of Tyranny With ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid appendix of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China opposes.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. election are in line with the announcement of U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn on advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a protracted trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese tariffs at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and a former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports largely agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in the Des Moines Register from Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by switching propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the proven tradition of free expression and independent press in America by turning the country’s paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing only a limited number of opposites and not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he said.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans clash voters before the midterm elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections that could be expected, especially by women.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University’s The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute lead would be enough for an FBI investigation to pacify angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what yesterday was, they don’t forget tomorrow and also in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate corridor area called “November is coming!” when the Republicans who control the judiciary decided to hold Kavanaugh’s nomination and that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, which detailed their allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidates, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a false mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans dealt with it and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told a group that voted against Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with who they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford issued a statement last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her time in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Open Source Solid platform.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said it best that the intention behind Inrupt is the “world domination”.
“We need to be active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content in one browser is available at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who can access what data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development through data.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. In addition, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”

Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The Church of England's only clergyman, who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroate for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire and led the line forward with the “greatest bravery” before he went forward with a field weapon alone and shut off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never be fair to, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he placed a wreath under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero will be visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the UK were not surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the battle in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, these content are classified as non-youth-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s broadcast at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
“Pepa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said the company will be working on the roadmap to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved in the repeat game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the viewers in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay there.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It was quite confusing and it was not always all nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical malfunction.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to provide the fans with the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Subject’ to Sexuality
Tom Daley, who has been a water jumper at various Olympic Games, says he has grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had realized only at secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, victories at the Olympics are no longer as important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne's first broadcast, he said that he considered himself inferior to others earlier, as the love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and being different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is a prominent LGBT activist today and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he has spoken out on this issue because he is fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner the previous year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks if you had to go through so much as a kid and a teenager – when he first participated in the Olympic Games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes his whole outlook has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main gain.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to be at the front.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“All I knew was that it was always my dream to dive in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song ahead of the Olympic Games and still cared for gooseberry skin.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must work hard to keep the whole thing from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day firing on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that plagued him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn’t disappointing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left in the 12 individual games set a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk confidently expressed himself to Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
“He was completely clear about his role today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can score 18 wins, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows it may soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
D<0xC3><0xA4>ne made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just above the finish line and led with the lowest possible lead, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that’s just barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured on the photo) after seeing National also win 5–6 at the 2018 Golfer as well as at the 2018 Freg on both golfer.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it's going right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly what's right.
The whole thing is over only when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Asked about the performance his players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never be able to do that.
Tomorrow there will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are at the forefront and this is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turnaround on the last day of the tournament, standing in Brookline on the winning side before standing on the losing side after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the fast start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medina.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We put our team together and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of picking up the match, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as further Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into service in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, however, it will not be delivered until early next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, according to local media.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand new frigates of the “Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg” class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy already in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and seaplanes, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, are already obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125, which was hit last year, officially refused to take down the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant “software and hardware flaws” that would have made the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is much too heavy, which leads to power outages and prevents the Navy from carrying out refit measures in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, costs rose to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a defense officer of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy “is leaving the ships capable of use”.
Bartels said that the problem became bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could be removed from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the Brown Langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and what species does what.
Then a map and a report of the living room is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how forest areas for bats and other related species can be obtained.
The stock of bats in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the issue of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the Dreama estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Goods manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal living space for her.
“Here at Dreamave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t yet know about bats, so we’re doing these works here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stressed how important it was to first rule out the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and with many of our species, we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence for the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports just hours after its release as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror over the allegations they described as “unauthorized reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped them, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who was down to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was agreed to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had “fear of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to lift the deal as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was just ahead of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid and this summer he traded in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal to Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The UK would ‘eternally regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK would “forever regret” if it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was “concerned” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily suspend production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby, should the UK leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will see production stops in our factory at the end of March in an uncontrolled Brexit,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without a deal and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are linked to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both from the UK and the EU to make the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to run a stock at the Derbyshire plant, which was enough for more than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today broadcast.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the senior official of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs will never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for another week” while the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates election interference by Russia, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein claimed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as the president’s resignation using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein debunked the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, accused him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this, but it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are currently going on with the Supreme Court.
That will show, but I always like to keep the press up and running."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not amount to a reluctance to the TV reporter’s “effect-hate,” but added: “But I wouldn’t argue that they do effect-hate.”
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president is making more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing accurate evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, however, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he performed a bizarre, sometimes out-of-the-box appearance before assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of the Scottish NHS due to Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from EU countries who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and express the desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already stated its willingness to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, exit negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a worrying time this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues and colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury after an emergency surgery
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was reportedly subjected to an emergency operation by Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury he suffered Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just broke up there,” Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before he was put on a stretcher and transported off for further investigation.
A spokesperson for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the nature or extent of the injury are yet to be known" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. Additional revenue is expected to benefit homeless according to the new Conservative Party plans
This step aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with the multi-income homeless benefit.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promise to provide more affordable living space and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional income will be added to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase in second homes and rented residential properties introduced two years ago, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance calculates by the step with multi-income of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, driving prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to become their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “housing.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price bond to a ban on rooms for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more power in the construction of new apartments.
Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which life from generation to generation should improve.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home ownership has become too far-fetched for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it’s his “biggest goal” to ever become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of taking on the club’s new life from the North East of England, which is currently in third place in League One and missing the three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound broadcast.
“But as a child, I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured in me at the moment as to whether I can bring the club back into the Premier League.
“Given the structure and the possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here to be a success if I bring the club back there.”
Ross is only able to pursue a three-year management career, after a phase as a deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That must have been a real divorce,” he recalls when he assumed the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny, as I didn’t get a bad job, was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult my whole life.”

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed a surge in revenue from Britain’s crippling pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s corporate advisory board, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuous sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected continued participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, but in which pubs’ revenue increases of 2.8 per cent were still disappointing.
The drop of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that rose higher than it did at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, however, sales losses of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focused on food, and it remains to be seen whether the moderate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed respite.”
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children owns secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One study shows that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools found an increase in so-called “fake insta” pages
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to become ‘Voice of Athletes’ at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the board of the Scottish Athletics umbrella association Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their choice in the council,” Beattie said.
“I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland,” Doyle said.
The American, who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, named his own four Olympic gold medals and today frequently appears as a BBC expert, was unable to run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows, provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
For the market launch of the "world's first low-noise portable milk pump", the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very seriously designed music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see me a tail” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not euters but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video hit mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it has voiced the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference being that their babies will be taken away from them within a few days of birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Repeatably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such a strange advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still quiet.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to overinterpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cooking’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that they all danced in their bras with the discreet pumps.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump has entered the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared as a two-time mother on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including as heightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children in foster care.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to even become the target for an expulsion when they sign up to pick up a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give up their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the authorities arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a caregiver themselves or a member of a caregiver’s household are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to track these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to process the children’s cases faster, the officials introduced new rules that, according to the staff of some children’s accommodations, require that they appear in court within a month, rather than 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video call and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is, according to housing workers, as well as reports that have been known from the system in the past month that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted outbursts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced with a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that traumas that many of the children are already suffering can intensify if they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish 'occupation troops' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, were illegally on Syrian soil and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been displaced from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" by both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are deployed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return have been met and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” to keep the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no building aid will be granted for Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity for political talks to take place.
The deal between Russia and Turkey diverted a broad-based offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian armed forces to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, will be carried out “will be abolished”.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a resignation or a scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time”.
So far, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-sentence turn-on rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, a showrunner in the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families, and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, Daniels goes on to be an informed citizen when you become aware of having already watched six hours of an expert's talk about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000 dollar postage stamp jacket.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get away from the screen, not when Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was just in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donation money floated the tightest races around seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Electoral District is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two incumbents standing in the race for the same seat.
The newly-drawn suburban district of Pittsburg allows Democrat Conor Lamb to join, who won his seat in another district in the run-up to a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily intersecting with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a successful exchange of campaign funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a near victory in a much-regarded special election in March around the state's 18th congressional district.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The U.S. tried to punish El Salvador for its support for China, but then retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering major resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama to partner the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the ministry in a statement.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were thought about criminal measures that received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that should follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to keep migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, in order to set a sign of the importance that the Assembly’s government has given, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak to the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the US election.
Should the congressional majority change, Trump will face a body that forces him to be accountable, at the exact moment he anticipates to appear again before the voters; and possibly before a jury.
That is a lot of ‘we’s’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein had been in Teufel’s kitchen since the newspaper reported last year that he proposed to covertly record the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein debunked the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly-arranged FBI investigation is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misstatement?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically ahead of the game against Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear against Villareal until the 2-2 draw, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“This was an important point for us as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling of well-being.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward to the last season behind us and be successful.”
Fear of old age can lead to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to care for them, only a few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they wanted to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Party of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in a timely manner.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn off legal disputes at the last minute.
Establish a guardianship authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that the health care professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you’re ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that play a role. Who are the doctors?” Martin asked.

Man shot in Ilfracombe several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after work among friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. British time, as “voluntary acts.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failed communications systems, the Auxiliaries were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary as the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, stretching over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been repeatedly victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean's coastal areas, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatran between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatran.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 shook South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A mild earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular with tourists and claimed more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and former candidates for the office of Vice President, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report released by the Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a friend when she wanted to inform the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 security deposit has been raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked for his plea, he replied with “Not guilty, quite certain,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A offenses, which can be fined up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be charged with a Class B felony, which can be punished with a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are disrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that cost eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the Home Depot construction market for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he stopped on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October while transferring pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targeted” and added “consciously” serious bodily injuries, according to the intent statement for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigating jury, Saipov, filed a 22-point indictment covering eight counts of murder against the background of the organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of rape and rape.
The attack calls for “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “horrible, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco damage, pain and loss,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not been pursuing a case with the aim of seeking the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was committed in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of a lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room, according to police reports.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the state attorney’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma that all those involved suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Pass Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
Ukip’s former party chief said politicians must “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling her deeply-disputed party has been exacerbated by members of her party, who are in favour of staying in the EU, participating in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone stated at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “chequers belong to the garbage”.
He proposed that Farage be appointed as a peer and that he be given the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for that, we would already be out,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is one of the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely false.’
The Brexit supporter of the Conservatives Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a top message to May, she continued: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians need to “feel the pressure” they should be just about to cheat on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘That’s not how you get out of it.’
He went on to say, “I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists swirled banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“It’s the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to 'Exactly Examine' Presidential Candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the election in November, she would “check the presidential candidacy closely.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump’s Massachusetts election campaign team in 2016.
She was the centerpiece of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested after death shots on LSU Sims players
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury,” Murphy J. Paul’s sports media portal 247sports told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene and possession of a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter-long Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 home runs last season and was able to average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes stable orders would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a short wheel-on-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of stopping after two moves to avoid the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the rear pitches of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri brought an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double victory,” said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Saturday at an election campaign event about Senator Dianne Feinstein, which insisted on not having passed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the West Virginia event, President Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the Senate proceedings show that people are “common, mean and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... Post the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, one moment, please.
We have it... No, we haven’t published it,” he added, echoing the senator’s voice.
Feinstein's letter was filed with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and he was released in early September, but Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her dementions didn’t seem to fit in well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the campaign event: “I’m telling you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the judge's candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the community, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the game back in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took early lead with two gates, after encounters by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the balance to the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League this season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped his equaliser after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again appeared to have a power play match in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen secured his team victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Airless died after he became sure that hundreds of people on a plane escaped the earthquake
An airlock in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly volatile control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely disembark.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to crash.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, the country’s disaster protection authority said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring auxiliary and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is speeding up to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, which killed over 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in Lagoon
The airline, which conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing one after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it could not say anything about a passenger's stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital, but they were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wait for the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking aircraft through shallow water.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working closely to improve a landing site rushed with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded on Saturday its evidence in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of having banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has been an expert in the field of information evaluation for hours.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said she had received position data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period he stated he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied, "there was my pick-up in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released their messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then take place before the jury on that day.

Another black one?!
New York girl sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' SMS
A New York girl accuses a couple of discriminatory dismissals after she received a misdirected message from her mother in which she complained that she was “still a black person.”
The couple disputed being racist and compared the legal dispute with an “expression”.
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that her new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she joined her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEIN, NOT A SIGHT,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending these to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After she recognized her Fauxpas, the “painfully touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice left, claiming that the open-minded African-American mother-in-law had done a bad job and had been expecting a Filipino instead, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 a day that she should have spent over six months on the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have been living with the couple.
“I want to show them, look what you’re not doing,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, having offended them, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to an “expression” and stated that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation.”
“Do you want to be interested in such a person?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
As the legal battle continued, the couple was quickly condemned in public and targeted on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s enormous success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children’s book, had no problem with it, had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was “after his death last year.”
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as a “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping, sounded slow and left her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers, who did not get any of what she was going through, went on board the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears were running over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad Women Hang Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Two women who have lost relatives by suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son had a promising career as a chef and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up a room.”
However, he announced his job before his death as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that this could have an effect.”
Davis designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids packed their presents, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to go through: “It breaks a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future in Sweepstakes as FBI Begins Investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something like this he was asking for, that is, a time-limited and limited investigation, then maybe we could get some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the committee in the party political deadlock would “break up.”
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Your reluctance can be attributed to timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans cut off as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unify at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equal voting and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors ‘sinked’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1127 survivors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
The vast majority of the survivors from the north will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often brings them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that had been set up.
As a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first and foremost,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit for office at the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterically” and said he was inherently unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had done so would have been described as ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all charges that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost cried and stood in tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the charges against him a “great and coordinated reputation murder” organized by liberals who were furious about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he was biased towards Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way in which he ruled over the Clintons and the Democrats, he even declared himself unfit,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not just unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial position,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basic ruling Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, preconceived person to go to this court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women should use it as a weapon.
It’s an honest hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Stone told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts crying, say to the person she said, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a men-dominated office, where one day I was crying out for an indescribable rage and being dragged into a stairwell by an older woman, an undercooled manager, whom I was always a little afraid of.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business during an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of presidential candidacy itself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind in fundraising and she vowed not to run if she wasn’t supposed to get $2 million together.
It was an unexpected battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so out of her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made it so difficult for voters to raise funds and direct address instead of delegates, and the anger over sexism, so overwhelming.
“It could have been assumed that I had suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls.
“You could have believed that the bag towel manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"Did you cry?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the U.S.-China trade war
The opening waves of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is not over yet, Beijing could benefit from a long-term trench between the countries, my experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he seized important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with fines.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing struck back in the same way each time and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any U.S. action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon collapse.
Moving Washington to join would mean giving in, but a public snippet against the US would be far too tasty for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a finish of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his stop on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win the cup again.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He reaches the torch further to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I’ve been watching on television since I was a kid,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had problems finding the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time today when we were putting pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed well.
We will regroup, I will speak with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
