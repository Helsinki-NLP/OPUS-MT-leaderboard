Europe's inflation spiked due to food
Accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant growth in food prices.
November’s price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the Union’s statistical office reported.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian Emissions Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic rate of interest, with the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, leading to the emergence of inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "remove" inflation so that it doesn't have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November’s inflation represents a record of 3.3 per cent for 15 years; in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has slumped sharply due to rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices have risen by 88 percent, and the soy price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on the world markets rose 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent this year, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation will remain at approximately 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double the interest rate during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, the Fidesz movement has grown significantly and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Socialists, the Institute has never measured support of 13 per cent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of the support compared to the five-percent support of the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are under pressure to enter parliament: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public’s view of the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous minimum – never before has the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high – 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are assessing the change in their material situation after spring and summer more hopeful prospects now more pessimistic.
As for next year, the majority of the population is expected to continue to deteriorate and only a tenth to improve.
In December, 71 percent of respondents judged, the most of all Gallup’s surveys so far, that the prime minister is doing his job rather poorly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny believes or strongly believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has 38 percent of the supporters.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the president of the Fidesz movement is 27 percent.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without changing the government.
While, after last October’s unrest, the government and prime minister’s persistence was seen as a desirable 35 percent, at present, this share is only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing a solution only in the run-up to new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is noteworthy that 60 per cent of the respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 per cent would say that they were likely to come.
For comparison, only 55% of the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly take place and another 15% consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, doctor's fees 79, and hospital stay fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84, and 89 percent.
Auchan is the most expensive, almost five per cent affected by Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budapest business triangle maintained last year’s average 16 percent price level growth, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Journal of the Daily Economy
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g in the Budapest business triangle increased by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of more than a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets of food "flying out" already fluctuated in December, percentages due to the previous high base did not show up until so drastic irritation.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could afford to buy quietly for less than 9,000 forints will not be bought now even for ten thousand.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption basket was 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but they were very undervalued by raw breast, nuts and also mackerel.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola in a two-liter bottle was under 200 forints, so even with a spare, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the consumer magazine Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Auchan, it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaz<0xC3><0xA1>g rose by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan rose by 18 percent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s lowest and this year’s highest were 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was an average of 1,480.
The average increase in wool prices amounted to 1,206 forints with the fact that wool for Christmas was influenced by the growth of VAT.
It is this process that the business has disrupted, and the business houses have clearly not been able to decide how much price range they have to set for individual products, as they have not been able to predict what effect the price change will have on consumption.
(If the trader is planning the speed of circulation of the product incorrectly, a significant profit may be made due to the price range adapted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer basket of Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g showed so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while at the cheapest it made a price difference of a total of 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not turn out, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than wool and also the cheapest one cost 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic increase in prices was found, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets was more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office’s data: it aimed to increase prices by more than 30 percent over 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to the flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed a price increase of just over 10 percent, given the basis, even in the worst case.
According to all the strengths of the flour suppliers than the egg suppliers, a drastic increase in prices has also been achieved in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trading gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three shops visited no longer care about the price.
They buy everything in quantity, and they take sustainable food on wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long fronts at the box office, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside, the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that the sales are also behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff stopping the infection do not help, says the Primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient who was injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon afterwards he had to return home with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria present in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
As of December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported in the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1>, a nurse at the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant causes of the disease have been registered in hospitals with certainty, the others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin, a resistant gold staphylococcus.
The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. heartburn, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if the antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, it develops from a bacteria that reacts well to the antibiotics of a bacteria that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads quickly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transient or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients over the years can cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the top doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections in hospitals belong to daily practice.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of the disease is not examined."
Antibiotics and Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and in masks and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital are examined first whether MRSA is present in their body, however, the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample collection is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, however, current ratios and conditions in domestic hospitals are not conducive to the prevention of the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens of the disease, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>z.
Because this infection occurs prominently in hospitals and homes for seniors, hospitals should monitor the patients received and isolate the MRSA carriers immediately.
However, taking microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these investigations.
Most cases have been detected in this way if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the primary epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to make efforts to target antibiotic therapy, or microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent the emergence of resistance to drugs, however, even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in the primary and outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Safeguards against disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role of hand washing and the use of gloves and masks, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by a caprine infection and touch, but in the conditions of domestic hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1> noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals, which are in an unfavorable material situation, it saves on disinfectants, there are few nurses and a lot of patients, so there is a chance of infection.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1>, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less or further spread of the origin of the disease can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it fights against it everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has signed an MRSA prevention program and reduced its incidence.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistance pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens among its priorities.
The police captain, who caused a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official exploratory judgment in the case of the police captain of the XXIIth district, who caused a fatal accident, is over.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXIIth district, who on Tuesday killed the pedestrian and, in the meantime, resigned from his post, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or deceptive substances, the spokesman of the Supreme State Representative of the capital Attila Morvai was informed on Friday that he had been sacked.
The scientific judgment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already found that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the Police Directorate of the XXIIth Circuit met on Tuesday in the street of Lajose Kossutha in the XXIIth Circuit with his own personal car while turning over a fifty-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter mentioned the fact that the pedestrian was passing outside the zebra, otherwise according to the rules of road traffic is not a motivating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned from office and asked to be transferred to the service, according to a police report, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with the state representatives carrying out the investigation from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Hungarian budget, implemented from the Cohesion Fund, a framework of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
A loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may occur later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which the budget will mainly apply to the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th metro route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Verese, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary amounting to EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission is subject to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering – the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is shopping for the ever-cheapest, but fast-moving EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seafront.
The mountains are mostly on the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Bal<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, it will attract interest from investors and the central part of the country – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and increasingly more interested people are also shopping around the exposed cheap city of Ruse.
The capital city of Sofia is also a promise of attractive possibilities, the business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and thus become, in addition to the summer and winter season, the desired destination of the trip also in the next two seasons.
Thus, the forecast investors are already shopping in large, for example, in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyle at the same time.
Most of the customers come from England, but also from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors present, at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Retired people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or derelict old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication possibilities, it is important for them to be close to the big city, shops and, as a rule, the local doctor.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium- or long-term.
Real estate in the capital city is incessant, as demand is growing stronger and stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but in the last five years it has grown by 21 percent annually.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to the information of the Minister of Environment and Water Management G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday and after Wednesday's official launch, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At this point, there is a stormy debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to act on exact figures now, although it has agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 due to the 1990s.
Another major issue of the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, developed countries will also be able to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are linked to it.
The agreement also gave rise to subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member Governing Council, most likely under the UN's World Environment Programme (GEF) - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungary's 6%
The Minister of the Environment and Water Management, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in efforts to protect the global climate and assist the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 versus the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of "agreements after 2012", and is prepared to commit to a reduction of up to 30 per cent in the event that the other areas will be respected and thrived.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves the target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, with the 15 EU Member States committed to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. - the press report of the Ministry of the Environment notes.
In Bali, it is a matter of a lot, because in two years, it will be necessary to adopt an international climate agreement on the long-term policy of climate change, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would not be moved until 2012. In such a case, the obligations to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not change immediately.
This would lead to a delay in the reduction of emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Makes Recruitment on YouTube
British military units are posting videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a server to share videos that they are popularizing themselves.
First, YouTube was popular with the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from action against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
In this way, 139 British Air Force soldiers have been recorded on the internet and more than 75,000 people have been watching their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes footage from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and International Peace Units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Category: Settlements in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos according to its original intent for the purpose of recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good to get acquainted with the general public with the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
"Promotions published in this form, in contrast to traditional television recruitment ads, are almost worthless," said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert, "but necessarily also carries a certain political message, as a special statement in the form of a statement.
The Americans made the game.
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also sent to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in some covert, "official" promotional films, the officers do not talk about the most, but talk about the most.
After all, there have been many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan that emerged during the sharp deployment, but the British army has come to them so far.
Americans perform a little bit differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through more or less faithful simulations.
At the ministries will be Christmas with a tombola and pag<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0x8D>ka
The Minister of Labour, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthov<0xC3><0xA1>, is apparently not sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a final working meeting for his colleagues, at which, with 2007 he will say goodbye to pajamas and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will delight the officials with a Christmas atmosphere with a towel and a drink.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees.
On Christmas Orphans will receive gifts for children of fallen soldiers, during Mission Christmas family members of soldiers, who are currently serving on foreign missions, but also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are throwing themselves off the hook compared to other resorts.
The GKM event is held in the center of J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91> H<0xC3><0xA1>za, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will hold on to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and also the tombola will be chosen.
NF<0xC3><0x9C>’s Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) – there were concerts and dinners on the program.
The lease of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NF<0xC3><0x9C> department is invited to another Christmas celebration: here is organized by the company ensuring the progress of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose they rented the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z Theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information, as we have not been able to intercept the relevant person.
The dress is not needed
The building of the OIT was not only hosted by the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the St. Lucia dance on December 7th instead of Christmas.
However, OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The evening began with the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to dance for the accompaniment of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the dance, evening dresses or dresses were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan party is intended for health, work and local self-government resorts.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth<0xC3><0xA1>’s co-workers don’t even officially invite you to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and pajamas, so only 350,000 for the party will be enough.
The Minister of Local Self-Government, Gordon Bajnai, and his colleagues, will simply join the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development in the classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas meeting, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated to 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a snack.
Since becoming Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the employees of PM Christmas have celebrated in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality strengthens not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Farm Resort will host a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministerial Christmas will not take place.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r Castle in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry’s message, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, at which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief visit of the Minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told the portal [origo].
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the environmental resort in the press department could not be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Art and Industry.
He's getting into a big strike.
The Association of Trade Unions of the League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
A protest public meeting will be held on Saturday, and work will be stopped on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as railway transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Association of Leagues, together with the National Union of Workers’ Councils, will meet with details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
On Saturday, there will be a protest public meeting, and from Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that the deadline for the end of the strike, which begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, has not been set.
If Parliament does not finally pass the Health Insurance Act, the strike call committees will withdraw immediately.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of the Parliament meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening, or at night.
Due to the beginning of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious interruptions of transport: the work will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of the Budapest public transport and more than half of the company Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n can be stopped.
At the same time, half of the road will be closed in many places of the country.
Numerous departments and civil society organisations have joined the call to strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League Association’s pages.
Some organizations announced the strike for an indefinite period of time, others announced a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) have not been able to agree on sufficient services, while the beginning of the Christmas holidays is traveling on the railway as much as possible.
According to the previous messages, from the beginning of operation until 13 hours will strike at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Committee of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, to 2, respectively, 2-8-hours stoppage of the democrats and the 2-8-hour stop of the day off
The Federation of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Services (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperation Forum of the Federations of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League Association is for the government to repeal the proposal for health insurance reform and to present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating pensions is to be introduced gradually from next year.
Thirdly, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system even before 2010 in the case of early retirement for the relevant professions.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZZ), which falls under the League trade association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik movement for Hungary in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, immediately increased in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the whole region.
The company’s “risk warning” reads: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that “by focusing on the already inexhaustible ethnic tension between the Romani and non-Romanian populations” the Hungarians can in short order
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at triggering such an action - the research institute adds.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest inconsistencies of Hungarian political representatives: "public discussion of the Roma issue was left by the representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could have engaged in the Roma-Hungarian political opposition."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts," the institute said.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, influenced by the great attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have largely corrupted the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-rightist groups, which since autumn 2006 has received increasing publicity and vehemence, is that in Hungary since 2007 several organizations have been created, which themselves are called "national" societies.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly proclaim - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of life-threatening disasters, attacks on the country, violations of the order),
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to pack up a variety of political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties to civil dress.
The emphasis on civility and the form of society in the case of these groups is therefore not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a factor of increasing risk in terms of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, and the ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighboring countries, by appealing to the creation of the Hungarian Guard, want to apologize for their own anti-humanist policies.
All this can have an impact on the political stability of the region," he added.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risk to the region as a whole has increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Roman unrest, which broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard, with the organization’s goal being “national defense.”
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been a "Cik<0xC3><0xA1>n terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Political Capital Institute.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a stormy discussion of the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that it will create its own guard on the sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own defences, we can read in the warning of the risk developed by the Institute of Political Science.
At the request of the press office, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year, and if they find something that could affect a change in risk, they inform the public, such as by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays are not free everywhere.
In Hungary, free days are precisely defined by law, and it has already become common practice for working days to move around the holidays, which is less than what awaits us next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working days of rest.
The working days of peace are usually related to church holidays or to important historical events.
Here we also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free to work - for the New Year already so that people can rest after Christmas.
During the year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is the 15th of March, which celebrates the revolution of 1848 and the 23rd of October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, and on November 1 and 2, we remember dead relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays are rarely on the weekends, the practice of moving a working day has become a practice in cases where we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that the previous Saturdays we stay in the workplace and in the school.
The day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, we will elaborate, has been edited by the Minister of Labour for many years in a special declaration.
The legal provision applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service, as well as to public service employees.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in the light of their determination, also operate on working days of rest.
This year there will be a change in the working order just around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to the experience so far, most people "work" between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance, or so use the agreed consent.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, or at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be changed around the holiday of work, so that then the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day so that it can be a day of rest on Friday, May 2nd.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will be working instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of next year will be able to take place completely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere a non-stop holiday, even though Silvestr looks like Wednesday.
Six Scary Little Things You Can Hate Your Colleagues With
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost don’t even notice: all of this “accelerates” everyday workdays.
The question is, if you get used to these minor inconveniences, or if you put on gloves and vague situations that others may upset, you will intentionally avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will inform you.
That that's why you missed the meeting?
In the best case, he regrets and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to hand over the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, it is solved with an apology.
Before there is an embarrassing apology, it’s good to think about what you could do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There is nothing more unpleasant than when you draw for some writing, office need or for your phone, and they are not there.
Remember when you put your sewing machine on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pen, which you thought was lost?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they’ll be rightfully angry at you for sticking with them in things.
Do not remove the envelope or adhesive paper from the office, as it can be uncomfortable when they happen to you early, and you will need them immediately.
Taking care of the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of the disease.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone about your personal life stories (thoughts)!
If any of them share with you their deepest secrets, do not abuse his trust.
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and with a strong headache appeal you report your absence, because you are not well, or you say that today you would rather rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work, which has a certain period of time, will be for you.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you are not going to work, or that something may happen, why you need to stay at home, report that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Rape, sneeze, phone call
Have you been immersed in a job that will take you away from a colleague’s snoring?
Unwillingly, did you become a witness to a telephone conversation that would be better off not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by snoring, chanting, loud talk (I am over your head), or by snoring, incessant chatter, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not included in any project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame yourself for your oblivion of the other!
Do not appeal to any chaos prevailing in the office and noisy colleagues!
Find out if you were wrong and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you could put the thing in order, fix the mess!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Warm-ups and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows!
Don’t be shy, respect your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular clothes – and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to fit in, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio a special melody is heard: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and to the previous tone color is added bass, then the female choir is connected as a real gem.
On the mr2 station is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
For a long time, our musical life did not confuse us with high-quality electronic pop.
But suddenly, the jam looks quite different, because you are listening to the new album Zagaru.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions originating from the home digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although it is again in fashion garage rock with its tuning into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in the Fifth Star and he also played in Yonderboy's band, until in the end - perhaps because the two dudes don't fit in a single line - he made his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to lose out only when he was called upon to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Turkish film "Season").
His formations, playing in the beginnings in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after wan2 magazine listed their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only home-based entity to be able to determine the development.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as they were: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, though the name itself tries to create a connection with the early years of the Pentecost.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zse Zs<0xC3><0xA1>gera.
The reference to the ethereal, flying would be on the spot, but next to the ethereal scent of this music now appeared - in harmony with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
At the premiere of the album at Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris Park, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, was introduced.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, playing popular music for the last time from morning to evening, we began to develop the melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground") Divas.
So everything is fine (?).
Portal hvg.hu presents Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zse Zs<0xC3><0xA1>gera.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much is left of what you are playing, borderline music?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and that’s exactly how it can arise just because of the sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude, as it is accepted, also works, regardless of language and state boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the West, light music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also older ones.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music going on around them, as they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where, and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather in concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the inevitable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if a person wants to suit an audience, from that moment on it ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboie’s example?
He's a soloist, and he's built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain itself.
We are more of a team of players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid our work being compared to Yonderboie’s songs, because a few of us separated from his band and set out in a different way.
hvg.hu: In the top list of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, Wings of Love took first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Have you consciously opened up to the wider layers in a more popular style?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit that we would sell the record to.
There's more to that song.
We thought of it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you pick the six singers?
Why is it – what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a church congregation.
Then the idea came to put together this band of soloists from home music scenes with a good voice.
So we put together this six-member band – Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – which we then crossed over to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you thought of the song, or did the girls re-create something on it?
B.Zs.: The song has long existed in the instrumental version, then when the material was assembled on the record, we thought there would be something else needed for this song.
Following the chords, he suggested that a singing part be added to him.
That night, I sang to him a song that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but, of course, it needed a miracle.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don’t have solos (except Judy Jay), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together, and they’re not louder than music, so music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to split the solo role is intentional.
Even this song is about forgetting a little about our ego, from who it is, where it belongs, and just letting the wings of love lift up.
I wished that this euphoric state, which we felt when this song was born, would be felt by others as well.
HVG: Which one did you work with the most?
B.Zs.: While composing the music in fact not with one, heavier pieces were more likely to occur during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to play grooves for a long time, then everything slowly found its place as if it were in a composure.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It’s always changing with the concert, even though I’ve already “released” the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A fraudulent broker risked billions of dollars from a minority
Proradical defraudant.
Jeroma Kerwiel, the French banking giant Société Générale, is the owner of the Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It cost him almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to equalize his colleagues and, moreover, definitely not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market at the time.
"It's mentally weaker," the voice of his superiors, who sent him to the police, sounded from his mouth.
But according to the statement made by French media outlets such as Le Monde, he was the man who had a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his trades at the end of last year.
The crisis is not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had payback problems in the past, will have problems.
However, this crisis should not have any effect on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, his profit was up to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t do anything for himself.
Throughout the hearing, he admits that he faked records so he wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though he started to be interested in his trades on the Eurex stock exchange.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd come for him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
In his position, he had to work out gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant to the broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
“As early as my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after his arrival, the first great success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he won, because during the bombings in London, he was betting on a fall in this title of half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, or rather they knew it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to freeze it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance of getting 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the next few years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The maximum amount of money, up to 150 billion, will be directed towards transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will handle the amount of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in the newly adopted EU funds.
20-year sentence for ex-president of Nicaragua confirmed by court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for the former President of the country, Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (no more than 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a domestic prison on his own estate near the Nicaraguan capital.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns behind bars, it is not clear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileany Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let Alemana serve his sentence at home or go to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund founded by German to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year’s event was held with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the turbulent debate before the government’s vote of no confidence, this time nothing dramatic was done.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law in peace.
It is a paradox.
Each rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether or not someone likes it or dislikes it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power struggle with the opposition.
This is more media-worthy and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The debate of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the strict numbers.
The state budgets of the past social democratic governments have suffered three setbacks that the one for 2008 is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is a high share of the mandatory law, the so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which in the previous year approved the silent "neighborhoods" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many caregivers, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional sources of investment, often inadvertently issue bonds that they improperly owe to their councillors.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from in privatisation.
They don’t have that source anymore.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more intelligently than our republic.
It is a huge embarrassment that falls mainly on the past government.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in the last few years, been quite superfluous to the gigantic scale.
Although some of the senseless populist spending, approved this year before the elections, has been cancelled, so if there is no immediate move to the limit of retirement and pension reform, then in fact any politics in this country will end and whoever governs it will be.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the tax money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the suppression of normal expenditures by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments failed to do what they could in the last ten years.
If we don't want to make it really possible for the ruling politicians to become only officials, then we have to be patient and grant this too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and bribes as it can on taxes and bribes.
Only these will enable the progressive achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
In this way, more than a hundred billion dollars can be obtained in the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks attract interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send forty billion dollars to the auction, and another twenty-four will make available to European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is meant to address the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” Bernard Baumohl, an advisor to the Economic Outlook Group, said in a statement.
"Coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting yet another billion losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else can come when they decide to do this," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have a difficult access to loans, they will also lend the way to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks have thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still concerned about mutual lending, and even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that a move by central banks will contribute to the onset of the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the decline of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debate of ecologists is incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been raised at the final UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a firearm of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions."
Now, therefore, the interested parties can read his unflinching attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional bargaining, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusion of the book is that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that the warming of the planet is not the same opinion of all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore do not represent a threat to the climate and that temptation is not a threat.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits.”
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver was unable to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the deadline and were unable to exchange the old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can ask for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new passport by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would leave without a valid license on the road after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the passport was not exchanged mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropolis are busy with applications and interest in the exchange of passports has increased this week.
The Master’s degree is awarded to around 2,000 clients per day.
The fronts are about half an hour away.
In Prague, the driver’s license has not yet been exchanged for about 140,000 drivers.
The issuance of a new certificate takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the publication within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to make a mandatory change of passport by the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver will face a fine starting in January.
The perpetrator will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer can also deal with a breach of contract.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be set at 2500 kroner.
According to earlier information, he could receive a fine from the town hall and a man who would not go anywhere.
He could have paid 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had earlier called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum fine of one thousand crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karl Hanselka, however, tens of thousands of fines do not endanger anyone.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not a civil document that must be valid for every person.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to carry it or send it by mail to the relevant municipal authority as recommended.
At the end of the year, the certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists need to gradually exchange other types of driver's licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates, which were issued from 2001 to 2004, will end in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the fines to detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of a criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With final effect, the Prague Supreme Court ruled on this, thus reducing their sentences, one by one year and the other by two years.
It was originally threatened by detectives of the Prague Committee for the Fight against Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is only waiting for a preliminary ruling.
In other cases, however, he has already received fines in excess of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
The regional court in January, in particular, admitted 19 people involved in the robbery, the Supreme Court today decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have since the beginning of the investigation rejected the fact that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, by agreement with Berdych, among other things, were handing over information to criminals from police sources, covering up individual robberies and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave 30 percent to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k for it.
The complaint concerns the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the theft, the victims of which often suffered serious harm to health, but also the abuse of the power of the public agent and the unauthorized armaments.
During home inspections, the police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core shots, laser pointers, or self-propelled grenades.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost twenty men in this process, the courts have already recognized the culprits from other Berdych thieves and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Poto and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who remain in Irish custody, have so far avoided the main characters, where they are waiting for a final decision on their release for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
In exchange for children in the maternity ward, a lawyer for the injured Igor Veleba families wants to pay 12 million kroner for a hospital in Treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, plus a court trip.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the father of two million and for the children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l hospital therefore disagrees with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a demand, it is very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
“But in order to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert judgment that the opposite party has allowed to draw up.
We'll find out if it has any telling value at all.
But we persist in the view that it will be in the hundreds for all," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the portion should range from 100,000 to 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns for each month when she did not raise her biological daughter.
Velebov served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert judgment, which was developed for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motola.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they struggled with the rumours that they did not prevent newborns from changing.
Women are once again in a worse position than the current trauma experienced and what’s going on right now, the content of Veleba has been summarized.
Veronika and Nikol were replaced by nurses in the <0xC5><0xA0>treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka maternity ward on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonov.
At the end of October, Hejtman Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families to compensate for the expenses incurred by them due to the failure of the Treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital set up by the country.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damages.
In case of doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, they can exceptionally ask for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to the people, the amounts were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka has lost the dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time, the designation was used by the King of Wallachia, but the project was built by a long-time team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked with the actor.
Today, Polivka did not take part in the negotiations.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is likely to not end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing Bolka Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vk's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>, everyone will be equipped with actors and comedians.
Harabis has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
Collecting money and inventing actions,” he said.
According to him, they are the cause of the money dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and they could have something of it.
They want to paralyze our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the King of Wallachia used Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the first time on his television show.
In 1993, she was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At that time, however, it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Valais passports.
From the original recessionist action, trade and lucrative business activities were excluded, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then followed the establishment of the company of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to give his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders a discount when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in the mane for his business purpose.
"Popularity Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka of the Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped," she said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, which was dedicated intensively to him.
The cooperation of today’s disillusioned parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka.
Since then, however, disputes began between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the session of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I chosen for furt".
The lead role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
It is clear that Harabish could bring into the dispute the claim of the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the date have not yet been disclosed.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like riding kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also calmly sign in," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing prejudices
Actually, I've never found much of a Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were nothing much, the quality of the sorting, handling and also production could be called leaks as an average.
But the market is now the successor to the Peugeot 207, and the one is much better.
And the van called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think about it.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headspace on the rear seats, for example.
This is now the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the van means that in this direction neither two-meter length will suffer.
Flying in the World
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't get too repetitive.
It’s a completely laid out design, where I have the only exit to the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also a feeling of increasing body size.
In the van, the aforementioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Suitcases for Suitcases
The main thing about this car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and thanks to the folding rear window) and as properly stocked.
The loud places are equipped with stop rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It will not interfere, it can stretch, and at the same time it will keep heavier objects.
But let's stand together above the volume.
According to the table in the basic arrangement, this is 428 l, which is rather the average value against competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - <0xC5><0xA0>kod<0xC4><0x9B> Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladoboleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot is left with a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a cart, this value is very critical.
But if I had to raise the positive, then I still have to mention the completely straight floor after folding the second row brackets or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre fire four-cylinder engine with 88 kW of power.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption, and mostly pulls.
If I compare it to a period of damage that seems to be leaking, as if the hose is stuck in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The pricelist will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a properly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a fire-fighting 14 for 329 900 CZK will still go.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment then comes with equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had the head airbags, the automatic air conditioning, the automatic start of the wipers, the electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs a total of CZK 531,900.
It's a lot, but charge yourself the accessories at Fabia and you'll get to a very similar number.
So there's nothing left to do but decide for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools does not succeed
British schools are home to children from Eastern European countries, raising concerns about the further development of local education among local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original population grow into violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
The fights, chicanas and fights between the students were also transferred to the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far as to detain a Slovenian woman in Chatham who had beaten a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
She's being held responsible for the boy's insulting her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovenian immigrant.
The men's girls were allegedly suffocating with racist remarks and throwing stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to leave it, he turned on us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even referred to disputes with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
In the UK there are 70,000 Slovaks who have gone there for work.
About 30 thousand Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it in a full and even richer count.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the pride of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become a warehouse and a treasure trove that the Spaniards in America raided and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of the 20th century.
He let it be built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially for prohibition) was welcome and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were MJ.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses have grown, after the wide boulevards of cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and had a yacht in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures to showbusiness and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls in Havana’s Bodeguit.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, you can enjoy cocktails as you wish.
And these iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving through Havana, because once imported bulbs and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since disappeared.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is considerably quaint, yet nowhere in the area is there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are.
Also other places turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since travel brings so much needed money, its development has a green one.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more librarian, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by the haulers.
A third of the scattered plantations were tied to sugar mills along the narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their car park has not been restored for decades, and so there are working machines there, whose wares are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
So there's not much to write about Varader or Havana.
I would just like to remind you that in Hemingway’s already mentioned residence there is a museum and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
Excessive vegetation grows from the calcium substrate.
Mogots, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their hollows there are fertile soils, thanks to which the ventral rocks are covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet with its final appearance if you visit one of the Havana factories for the production of cigars.
Perhaps someone will find it interesting that Major Zeman’s Chilean play was performed there.
Trinidad (country)
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed over the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that that that region would connect with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay out of it.
There was nothing built there, and so there was nothing going on, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If a person has more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places nearby such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach or the Sugarloaf Valley.
In the evening it is time to visit Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after dark and the music in it calms over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba, some refer to it as the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion is already affecting the road itself.
Both roads leading there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must overcome the high and steep mountains and pass through nature, which human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern coast of Cuba has been inscribed by UNESCO thanks to its unspoiled nature on the list of world heritage.
They make the best chocolate there, the church has the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today's hotel El Castillo stands, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, smoking, about the Sierra Maestra mountain, about the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Cabaret of Tropicana, about the shrine of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, the African religions that confess to the descendants of former slaves, about everything.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few soldiers and a lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for the next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the ideas, the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement today, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, has called on NATO troops to increase activity, the UK sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development assistance.
“Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be part of a solution.
The next step is to enable the people to start further economic and security development themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in the U.S. military in five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern Helmand province even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan units.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day interview with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
There have also been disputes among the countries involved over the past few months as to whether all the allies are taking the maximum out of Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a fairly large number of representatives in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers a "lenoche".
"Afghan defectors are revealed: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the footage, complemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to 1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a state debt of more than 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget management.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic has a debt of more than 84,000 kroner.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we could exceed the limit of trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” iHNed.cz analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora said: “We could get over one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move on to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
The debt is growing
State debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly caused by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt so far this year has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called merchantable state debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion kroner and has fallen by 13.7 billion kroner since June.
The average solvency of government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“The total debt in the first to third quarter increased by 13 percent year-on-year, which is really a lot on how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where there is an increase of 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows what it’s going to trade with when there’s a pension reform here,” Picora said.
Better than expected
According to the 2007 strategy for financing and managing public debt, the government plans to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget management.
It is mainly a deficit in the state budget, which is expected to reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the expected SEK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, the ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion kroner and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion kroner.
A woman is due to go to court in Chartum today for giving a name to a plush bear
A British teacher, convicted in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night by one of the Chargé d’Ivoire’s tribunals and expelled, according to her lawyer.
Britain has been accused of letting six to seven-year-old students give the plush bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was subjected to a penalty of whiplash.
This British forty-one-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in the Sudanese Chartum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after she was convicted of murder.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class plush bear.
“There will be eight names from the children’s mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
After the vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not have a label with this name on it, but it is a problem in the very depiction of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that she knew her well and that she would never do anything offensive to any religious faith: “I’m sorry she didn’t ask the children to vote for any.”
This view is shared by many teachers who describe it as “very attentive to their students” and add that “they never speak of religion in the classroom.”
It should be noted that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given Christian name in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to worship a prophet (often given to the first-born).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them a toy?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and last round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "in the bet" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to keep peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he said, adding that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations will end on December 10.
The Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population is located, could be revealed in clearer light by Dec. 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August this year, entrusted the Troika with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, on the other hand insist that the negotiations continue even after this deadline has been set.
"Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated, compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of managing the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
B<0xC4><0x83>lehrad insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo self-government President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at a hotel in Baden, where the "last chance deal" was held since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, the former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domain effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadi<0xC4><0x87>, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of any unilaterally declared independence of the province.
B<0xC4><0x83>lehrad is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, however, this does not mean," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"Kosovo's parliament will have the last word"
"The only acceptable solution from the Security Council is for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko<0xC5><0xA1>tunica said.
"This negotiation took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population was made, it would be "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has signed an agreement on Israel and the Palestinians.
At the start of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called out of his support, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of once and for all resolving a 60-year-long dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations that go from “road map” for both sides to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed at "closing a peace treaty that would solve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central ones."
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced in the 1948 conflict from their homes on the territory of today’s state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the U.S. president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations were "total and thorough" and that it touched on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then appeared on the stage, expressing the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to bet that it should be closed during 2008".
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the term for the realization of his "two-state vision", the Palestinian and Israeli, that exists next to each other.
Saudi Arabia said it had accepted a commitment from Bush in this regard even before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken up for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crusader in the history of the Middle East especially because he is fighting the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with a Saudi-backed Arabic-speaking daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such little news from the black chronicle, the official version does not agree with what is being said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the French National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was driven on Sunday shortly after 17:00 on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but was on the lookout and was running at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, at the same time had no side lights on," explains a police source.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to ride on public transport" (read below), driven by two young people without helmet, ran "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the police car from the left side after it did not give preference to the correction," one police officer said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle’s crew proved to be negative.
The condition of the car (damaged front, broken front glass, cracked bumpers) testifies to the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into the "acts of unintentional killing and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", the demarcation of which took place.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
Three witnesses, who were subject to hearings on Sunday evening, said the official confirmed "the version of the police officers, that the mini-stroke approached them relatively quickly to the left."
Some sort of rust, no doubt caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained bent until the moment when the police car was able to stop.
The vehicles have been secured and will go through technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were stained yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people were quick to spread the word that police officers should quickly leave the scene of the crime without providing first aid to two youths.
IGPN should also, with all caution, rule out “any serious wrongdoing” at this point.
"It's a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which you need to be very careful," a police source said.
The journal "Libération" met with an obvious witness of the few moments that followed after the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“We immediately ran down with the nurse, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to raise them,” the witness said.
I couldn’t do anything.”
Then he saw a "cold, completely frightened policeman.
Two others tried to raise one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone.
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and the certainty present that the situation of the youth is hopeless, the police officers were taken to the car of colleagues, who meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police officers".
They also performed a heart massage, but empty.
“Let no one claim that the police authorities did not help the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan are on the rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency, two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahor, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement forces.
The last names were answered with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called in.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called after the general strike and announced the demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were rescinded on Monday morning, with the aim of preventing the assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, a movement of lawyers garnered support from religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "invited the population to send flowers to judges who stood up against the exceptional state", and wastes to the Mujahideen's predecessors.
"Musharaf's promise does not apply"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is the direct target of an extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, he was expected to speak about the legality of re-election of President Musharraf in an indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
Iftikhar court president Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's judgements," the official told The News.
Parv<0xC3><0xAD>z Musharraf's promise to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the establishment of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms until November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The deputy minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also rejected ongoing speculation in the country that the army chief’s deputy had to order President Musharraf’s domestic prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms an unexpected pregnancy
This figure includes undesired pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or resulting in an unexpected way.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined)- The State Institute for Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted anticipatory legislation in France.
This figure includes undesired pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or resulting in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% degree of failure, Ined estimates.
However, the anti-conception legislation only allowed for better “fertility control,” the institute says, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use in women between 20 and 44 years of age has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five has a birth calculated per month exactly and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of the child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
For more than seven hours of work in space, astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed to repair the remarkable fragmented solar panel needed for the station’s next scientific operation.
It was a risky exit into space that collected records for the length of the duration, the distance from the residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the extent of the "killing" that astronauts spent on the repair.
The difficulties arose on Tuesday, while the Discovery astronauts laid out the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is a sort of landing pad for modules-laboratories.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a seventeen-and-a-half-hour module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so as to anchor at its final station.
After moving it, the crew began to deploy seventy-six feet of solar panels of the module.
And in it, one of the panels, dissipating like a tuning harmonica, as a result of the wiring, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Disposal has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to conduct a check-out on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, attached to the arm of the station, and carried out the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalkers) of the U.S. Air and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, stable, very inverted, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original appointment was entrusted to the doctor by "operating" the "split" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some "longs" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by another "spacewalker", who remained near the leveling chambers, and also inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey coated with an insulating medium to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after the cut" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed and then re-scanned his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are reportedly lost on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline announced that it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the A400M’s delay.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays in the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the start-up year.
The price for mitigating delays in deliveries of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European constructor EADS announced.
Due to these costs, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, EADS will be forced to announce a new outlook on earnings before interest and tax deductions (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that the EADS production performance in 2006 fell by 86%, mainly because of the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the large A380.
The group originally assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army would be delivered in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without a lot of anticipation: Russians mostly vote for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming thus, after the end of very little free pre-election campaign, his commitment to stability and authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a televised message to voters on public law stations, the content of which is kept secret.
He thus takes the position of leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is said to be celebrating a heinous victory.
When yesterday he accepted the ambassador of foreign states, the president did not let anything come out of him and was satisfied with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, and we wish to be as honest as possible with the most transparent and open elections, without the slightest flaw in beauty,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that “there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin.”
After the repressions that followed last weekend's demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, has continued to be banned, according to his lawyer.
"The mentality of homo sovietika remained for Russia"
Against the background of these parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are profiled:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates may submit themselves to the public by December 23.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no successor appears to be present.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, which will elect a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in the parliamentary elections, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The mentality of the homo soviet left Russia, it does not feel to be the master of its destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes the more distant connections: civil society has picked up, in this country christened five centuries after Europe, late; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of an individual.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population rather than terrorized this new paternalism, but a certain economic well-being,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntarily give up on personal responsibility", which they soon proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"How to think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social strata, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion gives preference to stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara <0xC4><0x8C>erdni<0xC4><0x8D>enko, a 40-year-old professor: "How to think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which resemble the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are opening up to the public.
47 million archival documents stored at a distance of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is at an end, yesterday's opening took effect.
Sensitive Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow us to explore "in particular the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of those who are forced to work," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CI-Comité international de la Croix).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these appointed documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental handicaps of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or detention camps compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work of subjected civilians, to bring them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin’s Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already reaching almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is hugely outpacing both economies,” and “India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second largest market for each of the top ten products exported to India by the European Union, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giant together exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said the European Commission, in a statement this week.

The Bank of England has raised concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction.
The Bank of England on Thursday revealed that it intends to alleviate the current concerns that credit market conditions are worsening again and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction for a base interest rate of 5.75%, a non-deductible offer.
"In an effort to alleviate the concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and give the banks more confidence in the way to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve in the period.
The Bank specifies that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time that BOE is pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally, it takes a week.
The BOE said in a statement that it was "still prepared to take further measures to maintain inter-day interest rates" of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interbank interest rate was on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fees that have deterred banks from using this offer.
According to some speculations reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many prefer to opt for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs on Thursday refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which equates to a rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "n<0xC3><0xAD>zda" (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary club) and contained ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which the increase in the remuneration of the employees was 50%, respectively.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was terminated after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the vote.
The head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will once again submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to the amendment to the Finance Act, which the Senate will discuss next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British organizer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a man who has unsurpassedly inspired the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most recognized festival organizers.
In 1989, he attended the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts 80,000 people.
In 1999, he added Melvin Benn to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also responsible for production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury “the most inspirational event he’s ever experienced” and says his company and Melvin Benn are working at the same time to give the region a festival event of European style.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as a market and, together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"I have been dealing with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the city’s current leadership, we have embarked on politicization, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents in 2005 revived the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after being featured on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place rather in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way so that we can create the impression of a rural festival in Europe as well as urban in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that they are "beneficial enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the moment when the program is just being printed.
“Vineland is going to have a rock vibe, but the music there is going to be huge to attract a wide range of viewers if possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the Billboard Touring Awards last year are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face the Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands against it.
This mission of persuasion is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult for the "Governor" to fall into the trap??
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer those that they will consider to be the best," he said.
Honba for Festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte’s promotion of the local film is a priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about introducing Quebec films, alerting them, and making sure the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on sale in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four feature-length films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are already with me waiting for the traditional marathon to take place at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive trend on the stock market".
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, in particular because, in the current contexts, markets are in doubt, at least in a short period of time."
These experts do not predict that the stock market will fluctuate in the last weeks of the year, and state that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity, which is prepared to invest in view of the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, impacted by the impact of inflation on prices.
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates (Federal Reserve System) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary stimulus."
Javier Barrio, the head of BPI’s sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that a marathon will take place.
"There's not much reason to rejoice," the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed to 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year by a little closer than 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional pension insurance deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as it is believed that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The aforementioned analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and “that’s why we could observe a reflection of the index triggered by reports from the U.S. on the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will make sure to bring Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series on strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, “because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich at this marathon if it happens to them.
“ACS has been gaining ground for several months now and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will perform very well, although they are not too represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of declines in two cases.
A real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained back 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We’ll see if 2007 will be the fifth year in a row (so far, Ibex has increased by 8.36 percent since January) and if he’ll be able to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the westernmost parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Similarly for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that has decided to make such a jump and invest in the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the departments on the cancellation of the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for other entities to join this initiative, which supports the opening-up period of the business, or not.
This is exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has outlined.
Get individual clients who go to these places after their purchases, small and medium-sized businesses, food shops and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
Thus, the extension of the opening period is complemented by a different concept of the space of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief operating officer, says the restructuring will not be a major investment, but a larger staffing force as it moves from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel River explains.
The offices in Madrid’s streets of Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a were selected and according to Rivera it seemed to be a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
For the first time on the stock market, Telecinco has doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We've done it.
Yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he found that the television he controls had doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
“There was only one thing that made him happy: ‘What I’m sorry about is that it didn’t happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,’” he said.
And yet he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
The stock value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocent’s participation (other 13%), according to Bloomberg, amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and fell by 40.5% overall since January, has a half value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with the Antenna 3 is offered because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do this on the same market, at what price, and how we will evaluate it in follow-up.”
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to surpass the billions of gross revenue from advertising to become the first TV channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the branches that provide the group’s advertising.
If the predicted data were actually achieved, this TV channel would see a 3.6% increase in advertising revenue this year, compared to 9654 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net revenue of the Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of the TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is the increased pay-out for Telecinco’s best relative development on the stock market, which has so far maintained: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, split its 100% profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemolu'.
According to analysts, the market at this time is showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the expected revenue growth has stopped from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected gain of Antenna 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of MiFIDu valid from 1 November
At the same time as the parliamentary proceedings, which were ended today by a vote of Congress on the novels incorporated by the Senate in the bill, the government has submitted a public hearing of the regulations that are developing the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and, at the same time, enhances investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will make it possible to provide financial advisory services to both specialised companies, both natural and legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services provider (ESIS), a financial advisory company (AFI), which will join companies with securities, brokering and brokering companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is expanding by connecting multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock market brokers.
The law further obliges investment firms to market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk, and ways of coping with risk, and requires a list of all the operations performed to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During the negotiations in the Congressional Trade Commission, several amendments were included, among which it stands out that securitised receivables were considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was rigged by the U.S. Treasury in the form of a hedge.
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legalise the functions that may be awarded to bachelors in economics and business administration 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for the economy.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide services of trading with products and acquiring clients for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union’s inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data on time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily correspond to the final data to be published on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The second vice-president of the government and economy minister Pedro Solbes said that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is a “temporary number”, but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively “high level” in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes pointed out in the billboards of Congress that "even if it is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the Minister of Economy said to the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since the Northern Rock Bank came into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually declined over the course of two and a half months, despite the government offering a one-hundred-per-cent guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to earn around a quarter of the revenue invested in UK banks over the next three years, in order to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion, reaching the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
Richard Branson’s group of magnates, known in the United Kingdom for their impressive advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach its chairmanship.
Northern Rock Bank this week announced the offer of a consortium of Virgin, which consists of three other companies, such as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
Today, in the early hours of the morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People’s Party) for allegedly engaging in corrupt practices during the construction that was revealed this week.
One of the secretary of the town hall and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MP of the People’s Republic and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources on Cadena SER, could be the “head” of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the building commission and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices in the construction, was charged, which was revealed earlier this week.
As Cadena SER, a lawyer for the “people’s” MP Juan Moralese, who was examined yesterday, was arrested on leaving Morales’s residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, Morales’s alleged selection of commissions for his signing of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which has overqualified 200 hectares of land, is the subject of an investigation.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted an offer to lead the PSOE candidate in Toledsk and, if they win, chair the Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapater to stand in the next general elections at the head of the candidate list of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toledo and in the case of the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party of the Congo was elected, and in the event that the elections were held.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the party’s federal headquarters.
The chief executive of the offer to the former minister argued that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who on November 15th announced his decision not to run in the next general election and abandon his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change within the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister was constantly urging him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He added that, as well as citizens, he knows who will be the deputy minister of economy, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono gains this function, he hopes that the House will turn into a “house of respect and not a house of presents or a cry” and achieve that “it will become more and more like citizens”.
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where Congress cannot speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the president of the government in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion.”
In the same way, he expressed his compliments to the current President Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and his "good work" and did not want to present himself in his place so as not to diminish to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the anti-climate movement is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who look skeptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show firm coherence.
Moreover, to have a leader who is the head of the government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or inaction of his government have significantly contributed to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires it to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, what habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who is sacrificing himself and who will pay for the salvation of the planet.
But we have not waited for such an explanation, nor will we wait.
Just because you have to sacrifice yourself and pay for it.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater from the point of view of the election that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that nothing happens, pure propaganda, passwords that are missing any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who doesn't even speak, doesn't charge, doesn't demand anything, but he's a matchmaker, and he excites him.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not require us to ride a bike and cool off with a sailor.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested on suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
According to the sources of the investigation, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totana, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police force, the secretary of the town hall and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to a town hall, where he now sits alongside a number of police officers, who also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests came at six, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after payment of 4 000 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> per year, will be paid for the illegal passages.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in a shortened trial at the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six detainees were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana is being investigated and today a member of the autonomous parliament behind the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his former wife, the owner of a real estate office, was charged today in Totana as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (province of Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which the fees were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, have also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the detainees, with headquarters in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, and Madrid (Pontev<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>e, Lasz<0xC4><0x99>e,).
At the time, only one person was arrested in Totana, a well-known owner of the company for poultry meat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with building the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the town, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and on Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico square in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiz, which stands on the proga

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper has published on November 18th.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The murder of the victims, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, an education advisor in charge of philosophy, called on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat journal for professors to take a critical view of Plato and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in high school.

One colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a criminal offence with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you cut a plate in the store for less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere violation (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you cut up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in the shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for download (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than to exchange compacts.
Participating in the withdrawal has a rate of three months to one year (<0xC2><0xA7> 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under <0xC2><0xA7> 184.2 of the Criminal Code to be less serious than downloading a film on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by a vice rather than by the provision of pornographic material to minors (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, somebody's got a hand, and that's okay.

My attending physician is telling me one of his articles about strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
The pain of the feelings that trigger monthly payoffs among employees depends on how much they earn from their colleagues.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and lead of the Neurocognitive Viewing group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague was mistaken."
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same pay, the activation was mild, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The applicant of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting a Balkan war criminal from the State Prosecution Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are on their way.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the title of the documentary film of the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach "Karlin list" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which follows the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York to the work of the Swiss prosecuting prosecutor.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a considerable expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of holding of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This obligation shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking shall receive an agreed amount of insurance in a certain amount in order to take care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of holding the driver's license, type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of controls, insurance companies concluded that people living in a marriage have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving, and thus the probability that it will have some accident.
With the increase in the frequency of rides, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best matches his or her insurance profile.
Here we will show you the most important variables for choosing one type of insurance, which, in addition to being suitable for the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five are faced with various drawbacks such as little experience with driving and short-stay driving license when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although it is ideal for good coverage, insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all the risks with the reduction of the insurance so that they get insurance coverage of all the risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose the participation of the client in the remuneration of the insured event.
“The part of the insurance event that the client will provide will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insurance, which will be higher, although less it would be to participate,” explains Luis Noguera, chief executive officer of First Europe in Spain, an internet provider of insurance.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants of the operation so that the client is insured against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce the insured in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
In contrast, malus is an increase in the mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, drivers have it easier when they go to get insurance, as the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to the acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all the risks with a discount.
“Young people usually can’t take advantage of the experience gained in the moment of an accident, and even when driving,” assures the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all the risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be a clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” Luis Noguera said.
Retirees are advised to take out insurance against all risks with a reduction of insurance (which amounts to 150 euros) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us the most.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will compare their strengths this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as for Italy it would be the first and for the Scots it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a move in the fifth game of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to make sure that before him, the Chesser will not get six points, which will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will enter the thirteenth semi-final, in an effort to advance to the final, which is played the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men will try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tact on the domestic ground and Celtic would know by the end of the game that he would be the first to win.
Gordon Strachan’s team could be enough to win the match even if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he can’t count on it, because the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first straight game (2:0).
And so AC Milan will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will get to the semifinals in the reorganised Champions League for the second time just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition goal Kak<0xC3><0xA1> (1:0) after a 0:0 in the game.
He hopes that they will win the "rossoneri" will be the <0xC5><0xA0>acht<0xC5><0x91>r, for which he has the prize of winning, only if Celtic has lost, both for progress to the eighth final and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
Spice Girls have launched their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM's Provost Stadium
About 20,000 people purchased tickets to attend a concert, which also included a video that resembles the history of the group, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as the release of a new album by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated bracelets given to them by her husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Prior to the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that “he didn’t see our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he thinks of the show.”
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to disagreements between us" caused a five-member group to dissolve two years later, also revealed its nervousness when meeting journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group's reunification, which she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that as time went on, "things settled and we all like each other very much."
However, many things have changed since the last time Spice Girls performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival at the airport, an army of guards was waiting for them.
Five of them have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is currently a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian fuel supplies to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is pipelined through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas to Ukraine, Russia will be charged higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two countries in the past year has reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest reserves of gas in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS ‘must control foreign employees’
The controller said that the Scottish Chambers of the NHS must improve the control of criminal records among non-European employees.
Recommendations from the President of the Supreme Audit Office Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the supreme supervisory authority was interested immediately after the June attacks on staff from countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) at Glasgow Airport.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of linking to attempts at a bomb attack in the UK.
The NHS Chamber is expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission is using Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which helps employers with controls in several countries.
“Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out regularly,” the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in many respects agrees with its own pre-employment checks policy, but also added: "Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign personnel is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the highest supervisory authority pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher also because the commission had a problem identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that the introduced control procedures at the NHS authorities in the Ayrshire and Arran areas, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and pre-employment controls directive for NHS foreign workers.
The health minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in line with the Health Commissions, is considering the recommendations of this report and will ensure that the best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment checks of all staff - including foreign ones - that it plans to issue next month.
The Joy Division won the film awards.
Control, a biopic about late singer Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture Awards.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked as Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn, and as Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been named the best actress for the thriller Scandal Notes.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety award for having received a British film on the world stage.
The awards were given at London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 Joshua Tree album cover, two awards - for best director and for best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film – as Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best document.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor award for his role as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation as a tough guy, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which was named after the film stars Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door to people like me,” he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my man, a great actor of his time, I’m very honored.”
Independent film awards, known as Biffa, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as on spiritual and security components.
The state television's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to launch rockets into the country.
Al-Qaida sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, i.e. since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that the cell of eight foreign-led militants was planning an attack on an oil rig in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid response unit to defend the facility against the failed al-Qaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry’s internal statement: 18 detainees were part of a cell led by a “missile-fire expert” who smuggled into the country.
She further stated that the militants planned to smuggle eight guns into the kingdom.
22 of the detainees were to prepare for the killings of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaida militants fighting with allied troops and the US-backed Shiite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be.
Al-Qaida militants believe that the authorities have bribed many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the ruling royal family.
Militants — backed by Saudi leader Osama bin Laden’s calls to focus on the Western Saudi government — focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," the interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" was also arrested in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate on Venus may be a view of the Earth’s future
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the current European station shows that the planet is even more similar to Earth's own twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and run on similar gems, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the glazed glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotational speed sent Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is devastated by storms and hurricane winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a glimpse into how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
“Our new data allow us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
Police detained “enriched uranium”
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Constantly Completed
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates it is not worthy to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and submitted them to the candidates sent out.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday was as comical as a snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading for elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the ballot box when they heard something pleasing: the voter recorded the peaks of approval when the candidates spoke of a hard-line approach at the border.
The strongest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who has stepped forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two fought particularly ominously when the plaintiffs asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Subsequent candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to get their bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance at nominations, but they both stay in the game perhaps because they started to fight on terror because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have about the same opinion: greater strictness at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to be very unpleasant when other topics came up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported the holding of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One preacher asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe the literal story of Jonah and the whale.
Another tax collector asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — who is now against all odds in the first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether or not Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run for office, earning him a laugh.
The fight is still unusually open.
Mr Huckabee’s rise in Iowa is overshadowed by recent successes in raising money and the loud cheers of Ron Paul in Wednesday’s debate.
These two diverged from the bottom, as both wings of the parties still could not agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with the winning report about the American size on the lips, darkening on both wings of the party.
This time the side is halved and the result is far from unambiguous.
Labour's Diseases
Gordon Brown once again found a trap into which he could fall; his way out remains the same.
Although this is common practice in British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
It does not seem that any orders would have been sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital rings were vacated.
But barricaded Gordon Brown would hang around without it being discovered that a wealthy businessman for four years had masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the call for elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being formulated by the increasingly funny Liberal Democrat president, the once feared Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unencumbered rescue of the problem bank Northern Rock showed weakness in the management and a foolish verdict under fire.
Misconceived proposals to change the tax code have brought the companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative glimmers.
Three retired generals launched an uprising in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, as they claimed that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, general secretary of the Labourers (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be irreversibly heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of overlap, where they find it difficult to rule.
People don’t trust politicians and they don’t like them, but they usually take away their distrust when we take over a new party.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is probably not going to improve anything, and it doesn’t even have to be in office for long, this shift is gone: the state administration is becoming a hole, ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming a mess.
In one direction, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new snitch in comparison to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the financial authority are linked to the decisions made by Mr. Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair’s mareres, such as a long investigation into the funding of political parties caused by “values for money”, voters can safely assume that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's annoyances are not as bad as they seem.
They’re not as bad as the conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been exposed to fraud.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and lightly brutal government.
The latest outbreak around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid, Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
Laws against the anonymity of major political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham’s actions but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be heard in detail; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-launderer, who learned about the horrendous gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all complicated; there is nothing to suggest he knew about these gossips, even though most of the payments were made until after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own side, but dismissed his decision by reaching out to a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - further led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, learning is not complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has six months left, and proceeding with a real reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour, who are close to cooperating with the Conservatives and perhaps even giving up their special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a devoted sidekick like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent jump in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to stand out for victory is indisputable integrity and high competence.
Carat sharks
Does the crisis of subordinate mortgages affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, the back floats begin to mix excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is collapsing, the predators have focused on a more immersive credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that losses on credit cards, if other consumer credit options were to be affected by subordinated mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
An increasing number of cases of inability to pay (in case of more than 30 days of delay of payment) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the provider considers inexhaustible).
HSBC announced last month that it has lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market — also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, panic is still early.
There are still very few accounts written off and the inability to pay.
According to Moody’s, the 3,89% rate of insolvency in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below the average.
Aggravating measures can be explained in part by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 resulted in a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make up a large part of the loss on credit cards; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for bankruptcy were met.
The industry also shows a good level of indebtedness, which shows how many consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And the trust in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than wool.
Direct routes for the spread of infection between the underlying mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when they dry up loans on property assets in real estate, consumers are rather indebted via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers tend to look at the cash flow rather than the value of handing over items, so falling house prices may not necessarily mean a change in the lenders’ credibility.
They can even be beneficial for the lender.
Consumers’ motivation to pay off mortgages decreases when the value of their assets drops below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards shifts up the list of priorities to pay off.
Card issuers will also be able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid change in the price of handicrafts.
“It’s not going to happen that one beautiful morning we’re just reevaluating all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinate mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those backstrokes.
British Bankers Accused of Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in a fraud linked to former financial firm Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally found guilty of seven counts of fraud when they, together with Fasto, had been denied involvement in a financial fraud in 2000 -- to get rich at the expense of their employers.
They were due to appear before the court in January.
However, during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each confessed to a single fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest employees, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for the entire two years of the publishing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the closed parts of an investigation initiated after the crash of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 warned Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's crash.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to devise a fraud together with Fasto and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the Enron-controlled affiliate, Fasto, which was the architect of a series of Enron scams that drove Enron spiraling toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch to be zero, but our three Britons knew it was actually of considerable value.
The company, under Kopper's control, bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the complaint, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this Greenwich NatWest branch.
However, the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow, and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons moved to freedom on bail of $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh-largest company, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks were no longer able to hide billions of debt or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is punishable by more than twenty-four years.
Lay's convictions, fraud and other charges were dropped after he died of a heart attack last year.
Moscow Non-Insurgency
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of them are interested in so many places because it’s for a close family or corporate president.”
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of proven consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have set up their booths, hoping that the freshly-rich Russians will appeal to everything from mahogany-exposed yachts to diamonds adorned with overhangs to cars, for which they would not be ashamed even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but against us it's fives and tens," he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.
On the waves of oil in the Russian capital, money is poured as it was when he had his days in Dallas.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans got enormously rich and went to Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Just like the 1970s Saudi raiders and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians became the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Klondike.
At another location in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine’s list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research’s local main institute released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “secondary” millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for London's jewelry industry, David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are beautifully edited, and men are each for all their goods."
As they walked in evening dresses on Sunday evening halls, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov<0xC3><0xA1> and five-year-old Svetlana Turovcov<0xC3><0xA1> identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I was looking at those cars and I can’t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Miss Yumatov, who was dressed as a red carpet veteran next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home run.
Veletrh seemed to be focused mainly on fresh groceries, brandy-controlled Russian shoppers, who are willing to sit out for a few hours in the street traffic, so that they can walk through the warehouse, which screechingly mixes Cadillacy Escalade, platinum squids, squids
Members of the public were able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's hand-painted blue tile painting in a life-sized size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bribery."
And indeed, the sellers here say that Russians with old money (according to Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashing logs to little-known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires’ envoys or ordinary tourists, floated every day in the trade fair halls.
And some of them bought.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, said Roman Ershov, the local general manager of the King Koil beds, that he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of the company A1 Moto, who features high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said he wanted to edit a luxury car that sold three chains to cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of the car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a slot covered with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a bicycle made of coarse leather or a portrait of his wife made of birch zirconium does not yet have to ride on those wheels," Karapetian said.
"He puts them in his garage with thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of the real estate here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper when you're not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has set up four red British-style telephone booths, stacked with columns of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
The others stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let their friends take a picture on their mobile phone, as they rested in the middle of their spare wealth, or just put a few million in their pocket.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey May Be Caused by a Defective Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant About a little healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the White New England House at two houses below West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police car was attached to the police station.
And then another.
"Then I saw the delivery of the forensics doctor," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroy, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the New York Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died as a result of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who was working at House No. 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroy’s death, and hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that has sent a wave of grief to the police in New York.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many at the department.
"She was loyal, persistent, and hard-working," McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"It was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Commission on the Control of Alcoholic Beverages, and that she leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union State Representative Theodor J. Romankov, said detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of the consequences of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities had heard from Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in the house of Miss Castro, with a ruined rose bush in the front garden and a dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
In addition to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was crowned in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first came to Newark after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy provided him with invaluable assistance in immersing himself in the unsavory and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The Fed’s hopes to cut interest rates lead to stronger global stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market’s hopes that the Federal Bank will try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by the calming remarks of the vice president of the US central bank.
The storm surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, executives must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm the irritated markets amid indications of reviving credit efforts, Mr Kohn said the recent excitement “partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and in October.”
He further stated that if increased instability persists, the likelihood of further deterioration in the financial conditions of households and companies will increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh doses of capital to the U.S. markets, and perhaps further cuts in interest rates to stabilize credit terms.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news about the U.S. economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial trust were supported by Bear Stearns’ announcement that it would abolish 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, as part of a reduction in costs due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by the loss of unearned profits.
Only 20 of these seats are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of UK blue-chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, market credit stress was shown to be in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash package auctioned these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release in London's money markets over-standard money, has increased with rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rising after an uninterrupted growth of 59 per cent since 12 November.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the pole for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the broader context of nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who holds at least the best on this post in the allotted time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help and because the staff of the bench, Hugh Morri, the manager.
Those who are not placed in sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is demanding and requires a judgment that ultimately must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask ourselves the same question in another area, let’s say here: John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and a good overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee – instead of just one.
Who's to say what level is right for cricketers if they don't get a chance to drop or swim to the next level?
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time as to whether to take the wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances in starting positions, whether to ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the viewer’s view is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better ones than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison claimed to be a healthy man and pretended to be a gunman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same straight average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for another.
Whether he will play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can stretch or affect the career of both, or it doesn’t have to have a big impact either.
Four years ago on Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test striker on the Austrian side.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give preference to Shah’s greater experience than Bopar’s youth agility.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his glamorous and valuable debut Test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 cents in the first class compared to six Boparovs, who are, in their twenties, seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin overdrives.
However, Shah made two exchanges in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, only ten runs, and this, along with the immediate refusal of the pickers, when Vaughan was trying to retake him from the pelvis from the pelvis.
On the other hand, the Essex universe has joie de vivre in bones.
On the cricket pitch, he is left with nothing, and his behavior outside the pitch symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the day of the exhibition of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He tied out with slight injuries and apparently shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his team-mate, who watched it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-fast swing arches on the playgrounds that seem to suit him, distributes effectively and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it’s just the art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets suggest, he will be the one to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and smothering refugees who had come in for money or expired their visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the gunmen who had driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers, because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, an 80-year-old Shia teacher from the mostly Sunni region of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amar<0xC3><0xAD>a called on him that the local militia, supported by the U.S. military, helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribes, whose home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, was spared a grenade attack after pressing his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The night before, a few friends called me and told me that he was going to the Sleikh militia against al-Qaida and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, a twenty-six-year-old.
Many spoke of the attraction of calming in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of occupied citizens", which arms on the side of the U.S. military defend their neighborhood.
But more talked about the fact that they were brought back by the obstructions around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the 11-year-old father of three children, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus force them to return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killings.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to go back to Iraq," he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will again resuscitate sectarian tension and lead to another fight.
Small S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko, good education
Germany’s smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its higher education institutions.
In only one area of education, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
“To a man who does not come from Saarland, I explained yesterday after the 50th that we are no French,” this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar educational system, which is in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in fifth place.
Colleges have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 in France.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the average number of S<0xC3><0xA1>r children is accepted to the university - many of them even without a high school education.
“There is a professional education system in Saarland,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an education expert at IW.
With more than one in five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of options in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields are considered by the number of inhabitants of the second best in the whole of Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered the universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering fields.
“After the first study of Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in general education schools,” says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that is taken over by other federal countries as well.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up in future comparative studies.
When conducting the Pisa study in 2003, the share of students at risk decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Syria has not improved as much as other federal countries.
The beavers are better at counting.
And to the dismay of S<0xC3><0xA1>rca, Pisa’s studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise, S<0xC3><0xA1>rca could score just in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in the gymnasiums – even if the inhabitants of S<0xC3><0xA1>rca are not French.
Chavez moves the clock
What you don’t see will be hours in Venezuela other than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will be allowed to move the clock in this South American country half an hour back.
In Spain, meanwhile, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has become a funny figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that the hours would move by less than four and a half hours, according to the new law.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision by, among other things, the fact that the United States forced the division of time zones into the world over the course of hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced that because of the hostage situation, relations with neighboring Colombia were disrupted.
This left-wing nationalist has stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't anymore because of my self-respect," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for reform of the constitution, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on in the Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute prompted Uribe's decision to remove Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe, by his decision, "flopped in the face", criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
The new mobile phone call here sparked a buzz: "Ponqué no te callas" (Why are you not quiet anymore?) - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who, at a recent Ibero-American summit, was so angered by the vocal remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
In 2007, the German population was in danger of paying less.
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages despite a strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation estimates, in 2007 employees can really count on getting a lower salary than they did last year.
“The wine carries a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut f<0xC3><0xBC>r Makro<0xC3><0xB6>konomie und Konjunkturforschung).
The new burden on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties that it must demand from the Federal youth a loan or a contribution, the newspaper of this socially democratic policy quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest level in the last thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, prices have risen by three percent overall.
Venus is the Hellish Twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: flashes in the atmosphere and windy faith on the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been suspecting that Venus is fading.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from the cloud to the cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific journal Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of primary matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. Storms allegedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
“If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something alive could hardly be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes temperatures are around 500 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it's the twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth’s matter and size, began to evolve in a completely different way, is the fundamental question of the mission of Esau.
Since no probes have been sent since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to the scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind gusts on the north pole, the scientists found a dark gust on the south pole, which rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth’s northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Physica Cosmica.
The second most inner planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with an average of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, called Jitrenk or Vecernice, will orbit the Sun in as little as 225 days.
However, around its own axis it rotates much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth at a surface temperature of 460 <0xC2><0xB0>C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, but remained in the oceans on Earth, while Venus evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus makes up most of the atmosphere.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler has called for an end to political disputes over the Dalai Lama’s admission to the office.
Indirectly, the SPD criticized her attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on a large coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s admission.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united in this matter," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not stop him from standing up for Merkel when she was told that she was creating a new policy against China.
“The Chancellor of the Exchequer has not abandoned the traditional policy of a unified China.
China knows that too,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disagreement with the Dalai Lama's admission, and has been attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "predominant" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the Dalai Lama's admission to the chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German finance minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize the Dalai Lama’s acceptance as a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located on the territory of China, is trying to separate from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against similar unrest that broke out in France
Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of similar unrest that have erupted in France in the course of a street battle with police, shelling, burning cars.
We must do everything possible to ensure that the social dissatisfaction in Germany does not escalate into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
The barricades were burning, the rioters were firing mortars at the police. After serious unrest among young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We have to be careful not to create social tensions in our country that will break out in violence.
We must take it seriously," he told the Hanoverian newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to resolve the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“Since the integration summit after the conference on Islam, we have been recording our first successes.”
However, caution is still in place.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have fought hard street battles.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
The president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, it should act.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is “over-averagely high”.
First of all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Colat stressed, "We must give hope to the youth."
However, the mayor of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to pay attention."
We need to enable young people to “quickly start working and learning.”
Meanwhile, the night remained mostly quiet in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel in Paris.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter flew over the area with flashlights.
Authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several fires of garbage cans and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have been taking care of the peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, said Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of the Interior, after a visit to the city.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The next night, the riots of Toulouse took hold.
It caused a traffic accident on Sunday, during which two youths lost their lives.
According to preliminary findings of the State Department, the police are not to blame for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela "Oblakové"
The chancellor’s remote exit from reality documents that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In which country does this chancellor actually live?
After her unhappiness, indifferently-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Parliament, we must note: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately manage.
On the pretext that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel replied with a very arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are about.
In the House of Commons, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserves to be paid.
He did not feel any real interest in Merkel, nor did he feel any real interest in the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblakov<0xC3><0xA1>" was introduced: a politician who excels above others, who flees to foreign policy and also expresses himself there only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: he has consistently praised the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate goals should be achieved in Germany.
And in any case, such self-acceptance - so much indifference the President of the CDU would have forgiven herself two years ago.
Now it is limited to plain phrases that could increase her liking among people.
With this approach, it damages its image pragmatically, which does not need to be flattered because problems are solved.
But in Angela's realm, "Oblakov<0xC3><0xA1>", internal political problems are a border issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of people with low wages?
She has a few other comments on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to supplements for children, is overreacting.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to be able to say at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things start to get too specific, it collapses like in a completely foreign field.
the Attack Department
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, in the case of Rudy Giuliani's and Mitt Romney's favorites, has erupted into a heated debate - and both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Guiliani of having made New York a "refugee for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani reacts quickly with a sharp exclamation: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," responds and prefaces the former Governor of Massachusetts that he had privately employed undocumented immigrants.
Because the Republican base has no clear favorite yet, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents, and the Republican base is not yet a clear favourite.
A half-minute video, recorded by internet users and sent via YouTube, serves only as such a key topic help.
“This is exactly the kind of policy of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” John McCain said in a preface to his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one who is promoting the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney either, for refusing to condemn a torture interrogation method called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience is in a state of shock whenever conservative values are raised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney explains incredulously, and asks the party base and the television audience to forgive him for being a supporter of abortion enforcement back in 1994.
Giuliani is in disarray when he is to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian life
The day after his resignation from the position of supreme commander of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf took a presidential oath.
It ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parv<0xC3><0xAD>z Musharraf took a presidential oath on Thursday to remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore that he would respect the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, his office of commander-in-chief of the army handed over to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby subjecting him to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power in a bloody military coup, the former general will rule for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of supreme commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to the High Representative of the State, Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will cancel the exceptional status soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The country’s highest court, which Musharraf, after declaring a state of emergency at the beginning of November, had been in favour of, rejected in the past week all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of Northern Vaziristan.
A spokesman for the army said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's crotch is coming back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again, and three members of the Harmonia group have re-recorded their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a rendition of the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three seated gentlemen, who initially look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box in front of them, the cables and especially the buttons.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of a snow-white shirt.
On his left is Michael Rother, 70, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is concentrating on the synthesizers, is from the perspective of the audience on the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by default, a traditional song will be created.
It doesn’t seem to bother the musicians much.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable excitement.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so busy that someone has been painfully missing this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't even Germany celebrate its still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you appreciate the musical style, mistakenly called klautrock, in England and America more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement, it was a hall full of tantalizing views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu!, the surprise of the audience no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have as much influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Berlin Theater Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons at the gramophone company run the church.
Rother briefly helped out with the band Kraftwerk, but gained notoriety as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still able to steal as a guard.
Rather, it was life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for this art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge is said to have been found in the ashtray.
A lot of it has been preserved by Harmony.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
The collection of the rosary did not serve only self-recognition.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been cut off from a record-breaking, barely fifty-member backdrop at a Griess concert.
At the time, Rothera expressed his wish that the members of Harmony should be evicted and occasionally exercised.
For Roedlia and Moebia, this was a completely inappropriate request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The band Cluster revived again in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company, Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland, has taken over the goal of supporting Krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
With this, we planned the overall impact of Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Ena’s words, accompanied by the strangest sounds, are echoed in the hall: “Unique true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are pictures on which the producer with Harmony is in the agricultural session.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which are a set of devices of wildly connected cables.
Previously, the three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the varhans and drums to get rid of the tools the never-before-heard self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of stabbing pointers.
This does not change the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she emphaticly sings "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find the roots rather than in blues in music colleges (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts ''68!' in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony is not even at peace now.
Even the most obvious thing is that he is thinking in depth on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question will either prepare a person for the nerves or give him a chance to experience the fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden appeared immediately two films about the war in the Balkans.
But not one of them is convincing.
The premise of the films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too impressive.
The Hunting Party doesn't stop an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzi<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still hiding in the Balkans, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere will find himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he played in many favorite, unimportant roles in comfortable female films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the subject of Buddhism, the man will enjoy playing the next film.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument to see The Hunting Party – Where does the hunter become a pawn (Why do movie titles need to be so long and confusing nowadays?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could become if fate and the film industry weren’t so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a caress-like monument, he’s always behind his back.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party is together with the German film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden, which is also entering the cinema this week, just continuing the endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that here the Serbs are not represented as the cause of all evil, this TV-smooth film is changing too soon into shooting and action.
The film will remain something very similar to the series Kobru 11, though without a highway, but for the sake of war.
In the film The Hunting Party, one can explore why so far a really good film has not been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three U.S. war reporters posing as a "village", a Serbian top war criminal, could possibly become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (here they are both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the ugly and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal will also prescribe a romantic affair with the later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can be rewritten with final validity after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film will be guided by what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminal and leave him to justice.
It is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worthwhile to turn to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally united here) that, on the basis of secret political agreements, they do not blame the persecution intensively enough.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will think of us in Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer’s desk: “I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil.”
In films such as The Hunting Party, there are exactly such bloated heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
It has recently been reported in these newspapers that all of the Hollywood films about Iraq have been a major setback.
The only thing that can be added to this is that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
When a star stumbles over a crisis area or wanders through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Boundaries of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprie emerges.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, they had to run for decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must, apparently, mature – films that are considered to be classic Vietnamese works today – “Lover of the deer”, “Apocalypse” or “The Golden Vest” – were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at that time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers, then, do not have the ability that is necessary for the flawless storytelling of good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was drawn to the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he stated: "The image lies only in the fact that some things never change.
The cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust to Criticize Resignation of the Olympics
The resignation of the mayor from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come under severe criticism of politics and economics.
Many people want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
But Von Beust aspires to realism in terms of chance.
The Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "in terms of business as unlucky".
No other project has recently aroused as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but created a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Federation will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference for us means that with the 2028 time plan, we don’t have a realistic chance.”
Yet this dream has not yet come to an end, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) has described von Beust's statements as regrettable.
The impression is that Hamburg does not want to attend the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too early to ruin the chance by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The resignation would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not announce Hamburg's candidacy at the University in 2015 as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Federation has just been nominated for a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been stalled by the Senate for years because it has been betting on the organization of the Olympics and excluding the construction of apartments," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area still planned the Olympics with the whole area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Taking care of the 2012 Summer Olympics has caused a great deal of excitement for its time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed into Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
The one who combines the expressions Sweden and wooden boxes, does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes made in Sweden today top the list of Warhol's works of dark shadow.
Most of his list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" published a few months ago, which expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, comes the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", the "Brillo Boxes" of Moderna muze
The preceding events are a winding, winding chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, slowing down wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but these are not on display in the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses at the time are now talking about fifteen boxes, which at the time were rightfully entered into the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them have been auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968, about one hundred boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were made in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the Supreme Conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, as well as three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden by bartenders in 1968, and after they were sold to bartenders.
On the contrary, from the structure of the 1990 copies, it was found that the paint was applied without the previous basic coating by a paint roller directly onto the plywood board - in addition, it is an acrylic rather than an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box book," Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet, said, "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to any other conclusions, the modern muses will be removed.
As early as July, the organization's Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "hard charges" that have been raised regarding boxes of soap powder.
The organization, however, remains in inexhaustible silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, who fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who denounced the president’s manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers surrendering to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were standing in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court due to a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to get away with about 30 sympathisers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to watch him, apparently ran to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal unit closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency session of the security cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People already have enough," Triallnes said.
"We're calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
Corruption has been in charge of her government for months.
In 2003, Manila's financial district became the main site of the uprising of some 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the revolt collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has tried at least seven times to overthrow a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05 % of the share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatile.
United Internet has announced that it is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in this D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15.1%, an entry agreement emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of this, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks together.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson said.
In order to take over the competitive company Freenet, the company was jointly founded by the MSP Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies will be satisfied at Freenet for the time being with a share of more than 10% and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the company.
It is believed that companies are still keeping all options open, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-read game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connectivity.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will gain approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
