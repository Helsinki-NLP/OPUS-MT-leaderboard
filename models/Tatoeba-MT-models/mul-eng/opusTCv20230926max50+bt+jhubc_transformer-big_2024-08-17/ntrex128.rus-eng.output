Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “walk on the maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly there is a dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP for their name (from the Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problematic decision relates to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the Labour members, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation "refined Twp and Pwp".
For our readers, not from Wales: in Welsh twp means “top”, and pwp means “cock”.
According to a member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organization as a whole “remained dissatisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to being written to the word Muppet (map).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire English dialect.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a name change bill, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be appointed, of course, will remain with them.”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 empowers the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the Welsh Parliament, instead of the Assembly, found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP version received the greatest support from the public.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are offering other options, but it will not be easy for the presiding member, Elina Jones, to find an all-encompassing solution. Let us remind you that the draft law on amendments should be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the establishment of the Committee ' s system.
The members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their name in the course of the debate on the draft law.
The Macedonian people will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote to rename the country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against the accession of its northern neighbor to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the name change referendum, said he was not going to accept its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in the arrivals of the Harlem: the bells of St. Martin remain silent forever
“The elderly people in the area that I was in contact with said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s nothing else left now.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The form of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room for the whole area where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, there is concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough, as their leaders rely on it. “Early or later they will remain with nothing.”
At the site of the church, he added, a multi-apartment house will appear, whose residents are unlikely to support the remaining revenues in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says, “and it will be a day when such churches will finally close, because the new neighbors will never be their neighbors.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church – 10 years later.
The first adherents of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was purchased by a black revenue, located next door.
When St. Martin’s Church passed into the hands of the black community, it was led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where they refused to take up employment or increase in the service of blacks.
In 1939, the building suffered significant damage as a result of the fire, and in the course of the restoration work, Johnson's father-in-law ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, who replaced him as head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "columns for the poor".
But the expert, who tested the carillon in July, called it "cultural heritage" and "a unique historical tool."
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffani Ng also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first instrument of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play the larger carillon in R. Chervi.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's church has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin’s Church have created a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, others by the episcopal Church.
The assembly of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, appealed to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese “trying to shift the cost of work” to the assembly of parishioners, although the latter had no relation to the choice of architects and sub-architects.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who was involved in lobster mining.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and suffered bodily damage.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach of Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he crashed with friends and about half an hour later he heard the boy's cries for help. Together with friends they boarded a boat to the attack site and took off.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was very happy to catch the lobster, but quickly “he realized that he was shouting ‘I’m bitten!
I was bitten!”
After going to the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely broken skin around the key.”
“I screamed to get everyone out of the water, ‘Here’s the shark!’” Hammel said.
The boy was taken by helicopter to San Diego Children's Hospital; his condition is considered critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told the press briefing that a shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it was not taken to dangerous species.
Gailz also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the area of the upper part of the bodyguard.
Authorities have closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Gales noted that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sinsbury plans to conquer the UK’s perfume and cosmetics market
Senesbury is set to establish cosmetics and perfumery departments in the boutiques of Butts, Superdragon and Debenhams with cosmetologist consultants, modeled after luxury university stores.
The perfumer-cosmetic market of the UK is estimated at 2.8 billion yen and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and goods for home sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desired market will be presented as an experiment in 11 stores throughout the country
The owners of supermarkets are looking for something to fill the shelves that have previously gone under the TVs, microwaves, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market are a good solution.
According to representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to increase the double range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Butts stores.
In addition, the company’s line of products “Butik-cosmetics” will be reorganized with the switch to vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two stores of the fragrance manufacturer Fragrance Shop will be presented in two stores: the first of them has already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the opening of the second is expected in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products every day in small drawers near the house have led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Cope, president of the Seinsbury, says the outlet will gradually turn into a supermarket, and the network of its supermarkets is fighting for buyers in a competitive battle with cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of supermarkets, Argos outlets are housed in the Seinsbury, and some of them can now be found Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to an increase in sales of food products and revenue through these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Butts was organized, but further disagreements arose between the participants on the issue of the division of income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Senesbury (a total of 281 stores) to Celestio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Seinsbury, said: “We have completely transformed the look and atmosphere of our perfumery and cosmetics departments to create a more favorable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to assist with the advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of stores will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of walking around the shops.”
Peter Jones 'crazy' reacted to Holly Willoughby's exit from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The star of the show "The Dragon Logo" Peter Jones "crazed" by TV presenter Holly Willoughby's exit from the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million, which she intended to conclude with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contracts and ITV's "M" contracts.
Willowby doesn’t have time for their shared brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
The business of this couple was compared with the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old leading program “This morning” announced its decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of The Dragon's Head.
According to our sources, Jones was "crazy" when the TV viewers' favorite during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after the conclusion of the new contracts, the cash is not worth up to 1.5 million euros.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow by Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double Willoughby's worth, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old announced her departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “The Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision has led to the collapse of all participants in the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
In Marlowe’s headquarters, there was a whole warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading “This morning”, one of the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as a potential delay.
In addition, it is about the break-up of long-standing friendships.
Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willouby created the Truly brand along with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company’s board in March.
Both couples often take a vacation together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the shares of television production firm Dan Baldwin.
Willouby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anthony McCartney as ITV’s lead broadcast “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult Talks, “And Then We Loved Each Other”
He joked about the criticism that the media will come across because of the “unworthy president” comment and a positive assessment by the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the leading news.
“I didn’t refuse anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong Un was interested in the re-meeting after Trump called their first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step on the way to reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean high-ranking diplomat Li Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still waiting for a “response from the United States” after the talks.
Instead, the U.S., the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is going to be great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong Un have borne fruit: missile tests have been put to an end, hostages have been released, and U.S. troops remaining in the territory of the DPRK have also returned home.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong Un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Becoming like the president is so simple, but instead of 10,000 people on the street who rush into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia: Disasters Recorded, Victims Counted in Hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs said there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had no roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a mandatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The Save the Children organization is preparing a team to send to Pal, but we do not yet know if a foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
In his statement, Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for Disaster Reduction, said that the Indonesian leadership had conducted an assessment of the situation in Pal in order to determine the feasibility of attracting international organizations.
In view of the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains appallingly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite warning of a tsunami threat, there was no siren included in the Palo to alert the population, which most likely led to so many casualties.
The transport communication between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake, is headed to Pal, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia’s old infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and has spent countless resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, which is running for a new term next year, has plunged into funding problems.
The president is also criticised for intensifying inter-confessional hostility between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other suicides.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in a match against Chelsea by goal in the far top corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the 89th minute of the Premier League game against Chelsea, which took place on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Gerardo Shakiri about 27 meters from Chelsea gate when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and felt in the far top corner of the net.
Cap Arrisabalag's goalkeeper jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was already too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: “The whole point was to be in this position and get the ball, players like Shack are always playing to the maximum, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw Kante come to me, I took the ball and, thinking for a short time, I broke through the gates.”
After the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, scored in the 25th minute by Belgian Eden Azar.
The central attacker "Chelsea", handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field in half "Liverpool".
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played a single touch.
He then handed over the passport to Azara, who came out the door.
Azar overcame the defense and from the left flank struck the bypass of the goalkeeper "Liverpool" Alison Becker, striking the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will meet with the Napoli team in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the stadium of San Paolo in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed it in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Office for the Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 points on the Richter scale, a lot of people remain. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis with waves up to 6 meters high, the Sutopo Purvo-Hogroho representative reported.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was overwhelmed by the rubble of collapsed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of fatal knife injuries to a woman
This morning, a woman's body was found in the town of Birkenhead, County Merseyside, and an investigation is underway into the murder.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with broken wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Muzz complex on John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses of the murder among locals.
Detective Inspector O'Hagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly urge all those who were in the John Street area of Birkenhead and were able to observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially to taxi drivers, who could capture something on the video recorder. Please contact us with any information that can help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the deceased had been living in Birkenhead and her body had been found in the complex.
This morning, the alleged victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Muzz complex tried to get into his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
Upon learning of what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Residents of the house have been told that they will not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police told the resident that the entire adjacent territory was considered the scene of the crime.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 a.m. two police buses arrived at the scene of the incident, and another one remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to observe the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a personal message to the subscriber <0x40>MerPolCC on Twitter, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
The Cromwell monument in front of the parliament building caused a heated discussion about the “rewriting of history”
Cromwell's expulsion would be a deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick's proposal a "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering from the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of the man, whom many have traditionally considered worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of expert debates.
But we can confidently say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected the further development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as a lord-protector also deserve high esteem and respect.”
Chinese Farmer Dies of Pork-Killing Pork
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer became a victim of swine, local media reported.
The victim's bloodied body (only his name is mentioned in the media, "Yuan") with a ruptured artery was found near a bowl on the market in Lupanshu district of Guiczhou province in southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
Pork is preparing to introduce vaccinations to pigs on a pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Sinin County, China's Xinhai Province.
Yuan and his twin brother arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Yuan’s breathless body, while the door to the neighboring pig farm was opened.
There was a huge hog in the piggy bank with blood on it.
During the forensic examination, it was found that the pig weighing 250 kilograms threatened the farmer to die.
“My brother’s legs were bleeding and bruised,” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the deceased.
The video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig-killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs had been isolated in a separate unit during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration about compensation for the farmer's death.
Cases of pig attacks on humans are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal drove a Welsh farmer to the tractor and let go, only to scare off a successful wife.
In 2012, a case was registered when a farmer from Oregon in the U.S. was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “dropping mechanism”.
Pigs of the game,
They are bite-sized and very curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You just have to give your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding to a significant part of the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring floods and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. on New York, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the south-west.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, which has entered the forming low-pressure zone, strong rains are expected in the coming days in the South-West.
Rainfalls of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfalls, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, the rate of precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mostly on most of the territory of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapid development of floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
At the existing risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Livonians can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause places to gusts of winds and raise clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone of places on the coast of southern California, rainfall will collapse.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small muddy flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, there will be tropical rain places, which will spread to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the rains will take place in the area of Four Corners and will last until midnight.
In October, sharp temperature spikes will be observed across the U.S., due to low temperatures in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature spikes will be particularly noticeable in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and De Moines (Iove) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in space from the South Plains to the Northeast of the country.
In New York City on Tuesday, the air temperature could rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the U.S. until mid-October.
Senate hearings on Judge Brett Cavano's case saw more than 20 million viewers
Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaze Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of trying to rape her in the 1980s, drew the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six TV channels on Thursday.
The political opposition around the candidacy of Kavanaugh received an unexpected follow-up. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Fleck made the condition that the charges against the lawyer for one week investigated by the FBI.
As Ford said at hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, attacked her and tried to put her on a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional evidence, saying he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, Friday’s debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audience of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: this is the average audience following the game of American football in the playoffs or the ceremony of the Oscars.
The biggest audience was the Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, viewed an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reports.
After the hearings, the interest in the case is not weakened at all.
On Friday, a real drama was played with the participation of Jeff Flayk.
After a senator from Arizona, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to record on camera as on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee's whistleblower, a whistleblower was caught in a whistleblower.
The whole world has seen how he, by lowering his eyes, gets a kick out of angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“Behind you, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position to the woman.
Fleik replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would comment on this topic at the committee meeting. The elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous cameras.
When, after a few hours, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy for the judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Fleik made one condition — to conduct an FBI investigation into the allegations against the candidate by next week, as a democratic minority had sought.
Flake claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Fleik’s decision took effect, as it was obvious that Republicans were short of votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published in one column with May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashki” plan as part of Brexit, saying she believes the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU is “absolutely stupid.”
The Death of Wade Sims in Shooting: Police Arrested Dayton Simpson on Suspect of Murdering a University of Louisiana Forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of the fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a regional CBS channel, police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to having fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, a $350,000 bet has been set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a cross-linked gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police Department, and local residents who helped with the conduct of the operative search activities that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked law enforcement for their “good-faithful work on the perpetrator.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the University of Louisiana team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 selections on average for the match.
Will Wade's team coach made a statement Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death caused a "shock" and "real grief" to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
Volcano covered with ash Mexico
The Popocatepetl volcano was dormant in the ashes of the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center recommended that the population not approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 parogaz emissions were produced per day.
According to the Center's observations, near the volcano there was often a thunderstorm and there was a feeling of tremor.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, users of social networks have posted photos of the car’s windshields covered with a thin layer of ash.
After a magnitude 7.1 Mw earthquake that shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded the volcanic activity involved 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl volcano (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Cops clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousandth meeting was held in Barcelona, dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps. There were no clashes between the supporters of independence and the police.
Police officers repelled protesting supporters of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, hurled guards of order with eggs and powder paint, raising clouds of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
After the police let in a ditch to restrain the crowd, the riots resumed with a new force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!” and their opponents responded with the slogan: “Hello Spain!”
According to local media reports, fourteen participants of the action got into the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on Catalonia's withdrawal from Spain. It was recognized by the Spanish government as illegal, but became an important milestone for separatists. A year later, tensions persisted in the region's quest for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to withdraw from Spain, but the turnout was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit mainly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year, in an attempt by police to block the holding of a referendum in the country’s polling stations in violent clashes, nearly 1,000 people were injured.
On Friday, the separatists were on a stated path to follow the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from being carried out.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who visited a separatist rally in his wife’s company, is betting that the hope of Catalonia’s acquisition of sovereignty is becoming more and more slim.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with happiness, getting the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December elections to the local governing bodies, the Catalan parties, who are in favour of separation from Spain, have won an important victory, although with a small break. However, this year their movement loses supporters, as many of their well-known leaders of the movement are either afraid to run.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a rally on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was warming up by both sides of the political spectrum.
“There is increasing tension,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, who have been in prison since the end of last year, said he intends to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was repeatedly carjacked; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The ride was completed on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinagard Kresent area.
As a result, the taran was damaged the gate and the building itself, according to Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that an onion shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's sharp goal
Dolly Menga's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team
Thanks to the batting ball, Livingston received an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's exact strike equalled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernians in the scoreboard, where they shared second place.
Gerrard's club remained undefeated on their way out of the Premier League this season. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, "Harts", from which the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will host a Europa League match on their field with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingston continues its undefeated series in the division, having played six games and not received any defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missed moments for Livingston in a fight with hard-hitting guests
Holt’s coaches were supposed to be in charge from the start – the Rangers clearly did not cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then defender Alan Litgow, trying too wide, could not prevent the ball from getting into the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, relying on dangerous moments when the game was restarted.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who scored from the central position.
By that point, the Rangers had the advantage of possession of the ball, but the defense of the receiving team was unbeatable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second time went on in the same scheme, although Kelly still had to kick back from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgoe made a wide submission from the standard position.
The balls were constantly caught in the Livingston penalty, but all the attacks were reflected, and two penalty demands — one for the provocation of backup player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the other for the hand game — were not met.
"Fenomenal" game "Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, reporting with the stadium "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympiad.
Their style of play and composition has hardly changed since their ascent to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of coach Holt is that he has been mobilizing this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led a superbly organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers could not enter the rhythm at all.
Although they had a good game with coach Gerard, this time they didn’t live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they did not have enough possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the receiving team only once. The Rangers, who dropped to the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's cold reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was a great weather, and the two top faces were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany in order to establish relations between the two NATO countries – a visit, and without it, associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state have failed to gain an understanding of such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan were located nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguous essence of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exaggerate Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, while others consider him a tyrant.
Accident on the roads of Deptford: a collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Depforth, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and those who came to the place of sanitation tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London police report that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and inform his immediate family members of the deceased.
And so far, at the scene of the incident, the roads are closed and the route of buses has changed: motorists are asked not to enter this area.
Long-Lartin prison riot: six police officers were injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during riots committed in the male prison of strict regime.
In the men’s prison of the strict Long-Lartin (Wustershire) regime, riots have continued since Sunday, which started around 9:30 a.m. local time.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado Opera Group was called in.
The police received minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided medical assistance on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained personnel were involved in the Long-Lattin Correctional Facility for the purpose of resolving the incident.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their interception measures can be changed for a longer period of time.”
There are currently more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the inmates.
And in October of last year, the prison’s leadership was forced to attract special-purpose units to calm the devastation of prisoners who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa may drown Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which will benefit drought-prone areas)
Arizona rarely falls into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it “scattered”: at the beginning of next week, Hurricane Rosa, making the last turn, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of rainfall on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Flagstaff.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and will rain on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression, being within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Weather Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, places reaching 15 cm on the Mogolon-Rome Arizona plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, it is possible to fall up to 2.5–5 cm of precipitation, where the precipitation can reach 10 cm.
For the areas whose rainfall will pass by the side, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can become a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
While rainfall can pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that is not going on in the Southwest of the United States.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory has at least severe drought (the second-heavy category),” the weather.com website said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will crash in the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane, the maximum speed of which is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has been found in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the second half of the day, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of "tropical storm".
It is expected that in some parts of Mexico there will be abundant flooding with the threat of flooding.
“In the territory from Lower California to northwest Sonora can fall up to 7–10 cm of rainfall, places up to 25 cm,” the weather.com website said.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north across Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is associated with heavy rains in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in the desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Weather Service said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous flooding, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Arrested Four Suspects in Attempted Murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager was seriously wounded by a knife. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of a serious injury attempt was found in the Exelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northon around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is considered “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, police in Eyvon and Somerset County said.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime, possessing any video footage of what happened on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "All hatred, all the evil" of the Democrats "has been violated on Kavanaugh"
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his colleagues in Wilinga, West Virginia.
In Trump’s view, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all the hatred, all the evil” of the Democratic Party was violated.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh gave testimony in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional appeal, categorically rejecting Christina Blaze Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago when they were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave testimony during the hearing on her accusation.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, the class and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s approval is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unobtrusive public service list,” the president of a crowd of his colleagues in the state of West Virginia announced.
In his speech, the president indirectly addressed the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, talking about the importance of Republicans appearing in elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important election in our lives is only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way,” he said.
“I wear like a hornet and I’m fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “with all their might to give us resistance.”
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate to approve the Kavanaugh candidacy should take place no later than Friday, the assistant of the high-ranking representative of the Republican Party said.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow.
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many carrying giant waves, capturing the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims of the tragedy were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday, waves of almost six meters high reached the coast, which braved everyone on their way and led to the immediate death of many of those present.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When yesterday’s storm warning was announced, people continued their beach break, instead of immediately fleeing to the shelter, and because of this they lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Police’s Office of Observation.
“The tsunamis didn’t come at all, there were cars, jets, whole houses, the storm destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and crashed with all force on the coast.
Some of those present took to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pal.
The aerial survey of the management of the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters shows destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaking the underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred on the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technologies of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that the energy emissions provoked by the earthquake were about 200 times greater than in the explosion of an atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected, due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage "large", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pal, in the village of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications from Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information was received.”
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was subjected to harsh criticism, as it did not report on the arrival of tsunamis in Pal. The authorities, however, believe that waves reached the coast at the moment when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, a video appeared in which a man on the upper floor of the building screams about the impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes on the shore, the water wall collapses, takes with it whole houses and cars.
The Reuters agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have led to large-scale depletion of electricity, which has caused a lack of communication in Pal. This has made rescue operations of the services very difficult.
Military transport planes with humanitarian assistance have been sent from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of first need, government sources say.
The city's airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centers in Pal will be visited by President Joko Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers from the charity World Vision arrived safely from Dungala in Pal, where the employees found shelter in the fencing tents, broken in the courtyard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, a terrible picture of complete destruction appeared to their eyes.
“They’ve seen a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place a mechanism to provide humanitarian assistance, but many complain that experts from international NGOs have failed to get to Pal.
Indonesian legislation allows for the involvement of funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the location where the disaster hit the area of the national natural disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, the press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government announces a natural disaster to the nation, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shocked Pal, friends and relatives of people who were missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will bring the faith back to the population for the better.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued who fell into a sewer hole.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recently held Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandaghi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, over the next few hours he desperately tried to connect with his colleagues from Pal, who were vacationing at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray bead, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Stealing $26,750 while operating a ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from Brink's cashier, fuelling one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Livi, Newport police said in a press release.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the booked minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
During this time, “Brink’s employee was run over by an attacker from behind” and stole a bag of banknotes to fuel the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not specify the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Yes.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “A personality formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye’s appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as the lead singer instead of Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences,” the author of the broadcast reports.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’,” West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one", and now I am only her, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye is not the first known rapper to decide to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love ("Love") or Braza Love ("Brother Love" or "Brother Love").
Jay-Z, who has performed with West, has also changed his name several times: by definition and without, by-laws or by-laws.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration that ended in a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised “never to resort to the army’s help to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired on the crowd and a massacre began, bringing 300 people to life. This took place against the background of the strengthening of left student movements in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated – the U.S. should double investment in its scientific development, according to Lee Kaifu, an investor and AI development entrepreneur with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier statements about AI have been made by several U.S. ministries, although the U.S. as a whole does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in AI innovations by 2030.
“A double budget increase in AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding companies, Face+ in AI.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in the American Otello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next contest would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that is absorbing academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Li is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. in the development of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the next generation.
China’s National Natural Sciences Fund allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which has sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow to settle a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and the United Nations.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would correspond to a minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was worded as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU on condition of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievskaya, 79, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have a binding legal force.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the votes of the members of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on a name change that will pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene, placing the chairs in front of the tents set by the citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, not breaking the thresholds of official cabinets,” Kavadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring investment to Macedonia, which is so necessary in a country where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the guarantee of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
In a second poll conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it was found that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of those voters said they voted in favour.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power last May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City bypasses Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling dealt with Brighton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it seemed like it didn’t bother him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentinian attacker received a pass in the center of the field.
He swam between the three defenders of Brighton before crashing into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and rounded up several more on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty area, in one touch returned the ball of Aguero, who with his right foot pierced the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the "Heavenly Blue" the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero received the ball, being deep in the territory of Brighton.
He gave an excellent cut on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touchdowns before handing over Sterling's transmission to the remote rack.
The assailant "Heavenly Blues" hit the ball in the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up glasses at Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals got out of the battle for the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of one game in the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, will start problems in the playoffs.
The 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8th place, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“And while we’re just playing like that, at least we can hold positions knowing the huge importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the audience and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the pitcher on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation, they tend to expose Sherzer for this role.
Scherzer, who is going to go out for the 34th game, threw the ball on Thursday on the pitch for the pitchers, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he will be a pitcher.
Washington's right-wing picker statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump conducts pre-election race in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans appearing in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, a candidacy put forward by the president to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s very, very important. I’m not running, although I’m really running, everywhere fighting for good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all necessary means, and we are observing subjugation and cowardice.
They don’t care who they insult, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want – power and control, but we’re not going to give them.”
Democrats, he says, have set themselves the goal of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, evil, greedy, and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Fainstein, which caused loud voices from the chamber.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to be leaked?
Mmm... Mmm... what document?
No, no. The language of the body issued it, I have never seen the language of the body denied words so much.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that holds different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion for a vote of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
In the end, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who have not yet said that we are not welcomed for our opinion.
A similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, with a vote of no confidence, I was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of my eight-year tenure as a local member of parliament from the Labor Party, the GC’s evening Friday meetings were just like that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that differences in views are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more obvious, and each opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political outlook I had previously considered to be similar to my own, began to expect me to radically change my views and take a position that I would never agree with—whether it was a national security issue or a national security issue.
Every time after my public speech – and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there’s a series of insults on social media calling for the cancellation of elections condemning the centre’s policy or claiming that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day face a stream of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never back down.
Most disappointing in this policy is the fact that such a number of abuses have become considered the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a “wide church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of the party’s election, it is already happening.
Over the past two years, I’ve received many recommendations that call for me to sit quietly and speak less, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that’s not why I came to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, being a student of the school, outraged by the contemptuous attitude of the Thatcher government, for which my school class literally fell apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most.
I’ve never hidden my political views, I’ve never done that in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could misunderstand my political positions and spheres in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to do economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on the question of my lien.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to appeal to is not Nottingham Momentum, and my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of cancellation of the election results will be yours, yours will be yours, or yours will be a political good.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East County
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible "Er" comes in first place
The two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, without a doubt, "Er" deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennent.
Now they're leading the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
In the end, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the receiving team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we were tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” commented Peter Merci.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to ‘Er,’ they tried better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, implemented by Fraser Klimo, put the "Er" forward, but the yellow card released for the game "Voors" to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed the "Merroux" to go forward, and Jason Baggott did not pass the test.
Climo increased the break "Er" from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in the break he made a solo attempt, making an account 17-5 in favor of "Er".
But the Melrose started the second half well, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who received a stretch, and after a re-release, the "Er" progressed further thanks to the attempt of Stafford McDowell by Klimo.
Acting Air Captain Blair McFarson then received a yellow card, and again the Melroses forced their rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klima without a ball from the penalty line, McFarson made a tachdown behind the incoming Er mole.
Climo realized the advantage by not stopping almost from the very re-entry, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the fieldmasters.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiran is going to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, a script he writes to, and is co-starring with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last on the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan plans to take part in a “promising restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia’s unseaworthy hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are displayed in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
Bringing it back is our duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a vivid memory of a coastline lost in favor of Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to resources; alive and eager to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia expects the decisions of the international court to be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the balance of the soul and, of course, there is a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's statement that after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the provision of a sovereign highway to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also eagerly awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if so, it will change little.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already said it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years the Bolivian case has not progressed, but on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean benevolentness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was passed too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political cosier.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to once again make sure that we have to go through our past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the path of resuming impasse nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the dream that long-standing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament in the first place.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the abandonment of the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive headwear, which promises to appear in the mass sale, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headwear, part of their SS19 collection and blinding visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats gained popularity from Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
A distinctive example of Valentino: the head beige finish, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included gemstones, a magician’s hat and even pineapple, but all these headwear are not designed to heat the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of strange masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these cave masks had their mouth sewn, and they resembled a portrait of Hannibal Lector more than a creation of a suit.
One of the specimens resembled equipment for underwater swimming with pipes and protective glasses, and the other one was a melting ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into mass selling — right up to you.
The hats of huge size go on the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot wide fields, which everyone was already wearing, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, gained such a wide popularity in social networks, gave birth to and sent to walk on the podium another huge accessory - a straw beach bag, not the same size as a sukuk, and it is not so big.
The orange raffle bag with a white leather handle and raffle became a bright example of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells the publication FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale next summer. Since the designer has already produced such a furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for acromegaly.
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which has once again been confirmed in 2018: outstanding test results have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, where they seek to provide the highest level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, then you turn to his heart.”
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations with and trust the citizens of other countries.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy leading positions in league tables and have the highest score on the results of exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese), while 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French, and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the curriculum of independent schools and in other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons that created difficulties for employers when filling vacancies, 17 per cent had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require knowledge of languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his further life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person, who knows several foreign languages, competitive advantages.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage — 15 percent said.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland there is a fairly large disparity in terms of the languages that are taught – each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in the light of the country’s future development by 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages are still of vital importance in terms of the country's future development, so this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The fans' keen expectation of seeing LeBron James perform for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday game against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump's pre-election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wilinga, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the candidacy he proposed for the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
How much will Trump’s meeting in West Virginia take place tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willingen, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump will probably not appear in the hearings that will take place this week, on the subject of the nomination of his candidate Brett Kavanaugh to the post of supreme judge. The proposal by Trump of this candidacy caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavanaugh was accused of raping and prosecuting
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans going to the November elections, to increase the pre-election pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign is aimed at ensuring that these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense season of pre-election agitation,” Trump’s campaign press secretary, who refused to be named, told Reuters.
Planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wilinge, the action could attract supporters from “... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media,” — reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia on Saturday is the state’s second visit in the past month, as it was here that he gained an advantage by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrissey to start out ahead of the competition in the polls, the president should come is a bad sign for Morris,” said Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Shows Ready to Fight and Fuels Hope by Heading to Couples' Competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday’s game two to two may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The moving initiative is an exceptional invented sports concept, but it is believed by the players, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So, who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” Spitt said.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points, and another twelve on a horse.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel “the wind in the sails,” and they have reasons to keep the spirit high, not least thanks to Spit’s and Justin Thomas’s form, who played together all day long, and each can boast three points out of four.
The sleep was indistinguishable from you to the giraffe, rather than a personal example.
The winning calls grew louder as his round continued, pushing the deciding ball into the hole, closing the match when they gave up two to two with Thomas.
His strike, which gave him a win in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar outcry, one of those that speak of his faith in a chance for the American team.
“We need to gather with all our strength and focus only on our game,” Spitt said.
That’s all that’s left for the players now.
Pass 18 months and become the winners.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
“Mollywood” was the only couple who didn’t pick up the Boggs on Saturday, but they also avoided the Boggs on Saturday morning, on Friday morning, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the non-Irish fans, reinforces the belief that even on Sunday they will not win, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player, than the one who has captured the potential Euro.
It would be great if they were both at the same time on different lunches.
However, talking about the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly clashed with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The rich and the two double gods on the first nine holes took the Spanish and Swedish out of the pit, from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
So exciting to watch the game in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and that they intentionally silence, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better than the team, and has come a long way on the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will receive a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the account in Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants to return the lost trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the permissible error of the American team in the morning games in four balls, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two matches, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from the 12 Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who earned the nickname "Mollywood" after the sensational weekends, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cup.
Defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then teamed up brilliantly to win over the fallen spirit of Woods and American rookie Brian Dechebmo with an even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he has lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls, and four – seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning game in four balls, returned to partner Henry Stanson on Thursday, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 score, taking first and third place in the world.
For Europe, however, the game has not become an easy and pleasant walk refreshing day to the southwest of Paris.
Earned by three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became an orientation for Americans.
They won a decisive 2/1 win over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to defeat Polter and Rory Machill with a 4/3 win in the quarter, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team had to leave behind in four points, going out on their own, considering that the team of Ferrick, as the hosts, needed to play a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not “categorically” disarm unilaterally without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying distrust of the United States and that his country would not, under any circumstances, unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear power plant, and the commitment not to grow nuclear weapons stockpiles and not to develop nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not observe a symmetric reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally take the first steps on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated the already-sounding North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not deny it.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump to secure the first ever summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; Kim then promised to start the movement towards the “Cordove-Torture.”
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls for a weakening of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and increases the level of pressure through sanctions in order to force it to achieve its goal, and even opposes ‘advertising the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second high-level meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, which have taken place over the past five months, and added: “If the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have happened.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide bomber.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much more to be done and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is disarmed.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set any timeframes for the process: “Whether it will take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council should continue in an active and mandatory manner until we see a complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second high-level meeting.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “banditing demands.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with the Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, will take “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” he was talking about are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest on special courses.
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all undergraduate students learn to sleep more and struggle with the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to wake up “nights in the spring.”
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was fuelled by the idea of introducing such a course, with a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘It’s a pity I’ve only learned about it now that I’m almost finishing my studies.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, tells about how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting success, as well as how it improves a person’s overall self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was found that students experience a serious lack of sleep during their studies.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of the lesson is offered an image of the room in the dormitory, where students, by pressing on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances - coffee, light, which are the result of lack of sleep - the result of sleep - is in the air.
In the second section, participants will learn about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages course participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health.”
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “sniff all night” is still widespread enough, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is the “secret weapon” of the student to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight excess weight, as lack of sleep turns the brain into a state of starvation, causing egoism.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year of study at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to go through a similar curriculum before entering a competitive learning institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students install an alarm clock that warns them to fall asleep and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps that disrupts a person’s biorhythm and leads to problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga brings victory over Gerard's team
The Rangers have been through another sad departure meeting, as Dolly Meng's goal has led the uncollected team of Stephen Gerard to a 1:0 defeat at Livingston.
Aibrox's team hoped to win their first away victory after a 4–1 win in St. John's in February, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerard from 18 games as a manager, leaving his team to eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost the power of the spirit, seemed not going to settle the bill.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth, Livingston rose to third, and only gave up the Hibernians in the ratio of the goals scored.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after the linear judge, Kalum Spence, had to heal the head wound after an object was dropped from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight substitutions in the team that went through the Er into the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livy 11 strategy, thanks to which he increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be happy to have his well-trained team tightened the opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have led in possession of the sword, but the Livingstones were pushed out a lot more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes when the first transfer to Meng Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs made a penalty kick against team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the far side of the bar.
The Rangers have taken control, but in the last third, there seems to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to hit a penalty kick for the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lowless faced each other, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian’s statement.
The Rangers made only two hits in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassana Kulibali's head, and Ovi Edjaria's weak lead.
Although Livy's first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own efforts.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball on to Menga to finish.
Gerard began acting on a break when he traded Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a substitution almost immediately resulted when the extreme midfielder gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly slid off his intercept line.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into the game they intended with Litgo and Halkett, constantly making long transfers.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
The Rangers reserve player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty kick after he faced Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanac: The Invention of the Geiger Calculator
And now the page of our almanac “Arising Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Gans” Geiger was born in Germany on this day.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger’s calculator also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans – such, it would seem, not like the heads of the scientists.
Man: "And what else is this stuff?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the impact of the atoms generated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, I can hear you right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not surviving until just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named in honor of his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the therapeutic action of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract the patient’s immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, the cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, then the cells must be reset.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one patient who has been given this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can "see" the HER2 protein, characteristic of many types of cancer, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifezda, Maryland, claims: “The results we have obtained indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It was in the prevention of immune cells in patients and their "teaching", as it is necessary to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West has defended Trump in the MAGA hat since his appearance in the SNL.
Everything went bad.
Kanye West was screened in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would re-take the post in 2020.
After performing his third song called "City of Ghosts", performing which, he wore the cap "Make America Great Again", the performer spoke out against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blaise Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Television did not show how the crowd was outraged by West’s speech, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes his cap was laughing.
“They were staring at me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in that trap.
They were really pissed at me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “And yet they said my position is not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a Superman suit so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL cast seemed lost, and one person told the publication: “The whole studio sank into silence.”
West was last invited as a replacement for singer Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: A PASSION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MNOGIES.”
Leading talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Paffy Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example you can, of course, bring an artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as "Prince".
Attempted murder charges against a nun at a Belfast restaurant <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihakamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
Star of the "Game of Thrones" Kit Harington attacks on toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as the sword-wielding John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, the 31-year-old actor hotly criticized the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such characters often instill in young people the idea that in order to be respected, you need to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the movie Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his cousin, admitted that he was “very indifferent” to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of bravery?” – asks the actor.
“What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this burst of toxic bravery due to too many muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What do they teach on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they have to show only one particular side of bravery?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because today, with young people, there really is something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the sequels or sequels of The Game of Thrones, after the series ended the following summer, saying that he had “finished with the battles and horses.”
From November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s remake of The True West, which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, a rapist.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best finale of “Game of Thrones” for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and further life,” the actor says.
Rose played Igrist, an object of passion for the character of Keith John Snow in the fantasy series, which was awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14 per cent growth in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens who have been infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases occurs due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has been promising universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about the Republican Party’s senators’ guilt, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that one of her employees had placed personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages of lawmakers.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were falsified by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“It’s a lie, a lie, and an even more fake lie,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators. Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings in a Senate commission on sexual harassment charges brought against a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and published information about Waters employees, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Flaisser writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself either.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the prosecutors, either.
You have to stay calm and cool.”
Fleischer appeared to have compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavano, whose critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the Waters seat in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very important,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent actions.
“We will make sure that the criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the UK somehow figures; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise "Agent Johnny Inglish", whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Ingel's "Ingel's"
Will a self-ironic picture with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, glamorous profan Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time — this is his name most vividly hinting that he is a widescreen comic creation intended for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, despite his strange claims to the glamorous stripe, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy, who brought a single note to the 2012 album Chariots of Fire in London.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the personality of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this latest issue, I have one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny Inglish approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the shovels were crawling over his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such "serious" movie rehearsals as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible" are now offered.
The sense that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny Inglish's bizarre abuses are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's jokes in the movies about Mr. Bean.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker penetrated the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, an intimidating and hard-working figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the character Quasi-Theresa-May, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage, Johnny Inglish himself plays his own character, who now works as a school teacher in some pontifical institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operative work: here are some good jokes, because Inglish offers "skills" in style.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former unsatisfying friend, Buff, whom Ben Miller plays this time.
Buff is now a married man who is subordinate to the captain of the submarine – the role of the “fun hockey clubs”, in which Vicky Pepperdin is a bit lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that in the secret service of Her Majesty there were terrible mistakes. They are confronted with a beautiful rock woman by Ophelia Bulletova in performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems – the villainous Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglisch and Baff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: masked under waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of Volt; Inglisch breeds a complete anarchy, trying to make use of a reconnaissance garrison.
All of these scenes, of course, are a sweet and seductive invention, but in all of this there is something quite childish.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny Inglish films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day salary.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is going to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but will get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the executives of the companies to give the workers savings received as a result of the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra weekend.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
The sources said the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and will help the country’s population become on the side of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers can benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day working week even during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretely define his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the “invisible directors” and “speculators” of communal firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the vodka channels may not get back their entire share, as the Labour government can make “calculations” based on the alleged offenses.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on board of directors of companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the private sector firm’s capital to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' Whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh Could Change Their Opinion
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment as Supreme Court judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could prompt any Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham on whether the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, came up with this information, I asked, "Did you do this?"
His response was decisive, definite, and unambiguous.”
But Graham’s opinion in the vote remained indisputable.
“I have firmly decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by force of action comparable only to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett strongly denied all of this,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses could confirm these facts, either.
This story has been 36 years.
I haven’t seen anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce the level of poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival (World Citizens’ Festival) – an annual music event in which an impressive star cast with at least an impressive mission is taking part – the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year in the framework of the Festival of Citizens of the World as tens of thousands of people flock to the large swing of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, as well as to tell the story of the 20th century.
The World Citizens’ Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global project to combat poverty, conducted by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you’re not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteer activities or send an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or perform any other or other significant actions aimed at helping out.
But how successful has the Festival of Citizens of the World become in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by freely attending a concert really convincing the citizen to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending a message?
Organizers of Global Citizen say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that thanks to these actions, world leaders have promised to allocate funds of more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group voiced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
According to the group, the funds allocated have provided direct assistance to almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments of the Globals is called The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children to fully reveal their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million to help put an end to it.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about inadequate nutrition past history,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “Power of Nutrition” project, which will cover 5 million women and children through activities to improve.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen organizers say: “This will be a long and difficult path on which we will occasionally stumble and fall.
But, as in the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Jeanne Monnet are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event and will be led by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to “block” Russia’s energy exports: the interior minister
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could "if necessary" resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a prerequisite for studying new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the ability to ensure the openness of sea lanes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister said, calling Russia “a pony with one trick” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were due to the fact that the Trump administration has set the task of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream-2 project, which should double the existing pipeline’s capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state intervenes in our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the possibilities of running for president in 2020 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would carefully study the possibilities of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the pre-election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and ‘rest’ our broken government, and for that ‘top’ needs a woman,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s activities during the meeting: “This district is heading in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Saffolka/Boston Globe University Political Research Center, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population is more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent support his possible participation in the election, and 48 per cent oppose it.
Other well-known names of the Democrats, which were discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told about Trac Paylin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's voters
Track Palin, 26, after joining the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experiences as other family members who have experienced the effects of PTSD and have had injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “belt in the eye” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They are returning already others, stunned by the question, and whether the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, airmen and any other soldiers as they have shown their country.”
Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in the situation of violence and the storage of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the police department of Vasil.
18 states, the District of Columbia, support the challenge of a new policy of granting asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday from a court adviser about the support of a policy-challenging asylum seeker.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband and his sons, who are in the criminal group, have been subjected to cruel treatment, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as are countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum-seekers has cancelled a decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents saved from domestic violence to apply for asylum-seekers.
Colombian District Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court counsel said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims of domestic or gang-rape-related violence.
“Refugees will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save the people of Pal: the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation has become more and more difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says Risa Kusuma’s 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute of emergency assistance brings the wounded.
Clean water in the big deficit.”
Residents return to their ruined homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dway Harris, who had a spinal and shoulder fracture, were resting near Pal's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing strong pressure.
He cries, recalling how a powerful earthquake destroyed a room in a hotel on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
“I think I was pushed into the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they are safe and all is well with them now.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Attacks” Through “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published an ad in the daily U.S. publication on four pages about the mutual benefit of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, making accusations against China in an attempt to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections that will take place on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials have told Reuters: there is a new stage in Washington’s intensifying campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of trade war, as a result of which they equalize tariffs on imports from their countries.
China’s tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at striking exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an article published in the Sunday Journal of the Des Moines Register, “now doubles this trauma by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press, paying and placing advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newspaper kiosks here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear any dissenting voices and you will not see the true variety of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with, learning about China’s alarming economic policy, because the local media is in control.
He also added that one of China’s best-known newspapers “sadly denied” the proposal to publish his article, although it did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: by the Kavanaugh spread, Republicans push back women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain sidelined and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, despite several statements about sexual violence. Analysts warn that there may be a negative reaction to the prosecution, especially
Emotions around this situation have escalated to extremes, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to those things later,” Grant Ryer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, wrote in an article published on Saturday.
Ryer doubts that Senator Jeff Fleik’s (R-Arizona) attempts to conduct an FBI investigation done at the last minute will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women aren’t going to forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget about it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November ahead!" against the Senate when Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to run for Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limits,” said non-partisan political scientist Steve Rothenberg.
“People say that the situation has already escalated quite a bit, and that’s true.
But everything can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirm the nomination, this move could trigger a backlash.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Style, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about a vote on the committee or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sat on the bench of the defendants, but also about how Republicans deal with how they treat her,” says Guy Cecil, the new director of Priorities USA, a dekrast group that
However, the Americans seem to have divided somewhat on the question of who to still believe — Ford or Kavanaugh, and are slightly more inclined towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s evidence is accurate or likely to believe it, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh is accurate or likely to believe it.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying while giving his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
At the FBI’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while in a state of intoxication, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitalia at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal online data store is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal extension of rights and opportunities through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea is that the company has provided resources, processes, and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform, purchased by IBM, several staff developers with whom the project is contracted, and a community of programmers-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make dramatic changes, as a result of which all their business models will change completely overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission from them.”
In his post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in the debates about net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Church servant awarded by the Victoria Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Church of England, only one war priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglis and Leucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument in honor of this event was solemnly opened by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Canten Canal “in a very thick fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and machine guns.”
Later he threw himself on the line of fire and with "great courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand threw a field gun, striking three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old’s grandson, Michael Vann, said: “He probably wouldn’t have been able to do the same heroic thing, but it calms down.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the end of the parade, led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the virtue of a real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppa Pig
Imagine you haven’t slept all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you haven’t been able to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six of the main program's battles, the fights were broadcast live all night on the UK's 5 television channel.
At six o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the fans of the UK were stunned to see the “Peppa Pig” screens.
Some fans didn’t get that at all, because they didn’t sleep until morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change to the children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“The government has ruled that this content is inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Peppa Pig."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they plan to draw up a schedule so that in the future the fighting could also be watched by viewers from the UK.
“As for the re-show, I think we’ll be able to solve this issue,” Cocker says.
“But there is Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this issue until Sunday in our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we will make the most of our efforts.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out to be no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We’re going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we’re trying to increase that number, but it’s overtaking.
Yes, it did not go well.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has experienced a sense of incompleteness due to his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse for everyone because of his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that the victory at the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a child.
The permanent lead multi-year show Kirsty Young due to illness took a vacation for several months.
Daley, who played the lead guest on Laverne’s program, said he felt “more worthless than any of the peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
“To this day, these feelings of inadequacy and inadequacy were quite real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had “something to do” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a famous LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “remained his own.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If that’s what happens in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympiad at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find an equal who would have the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that “all his worldview” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t want to settle for dying, and one of his last requests was tickets to the first-ever London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he wasn’t invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still so much he likes it.

Michaelson, who is not in shape, held this Saturday the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mykelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to pull the form to avoid an unpleasant stir.
Michaelson, who played at the biennale for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time major winner split his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in hopes of fixing what worries him.
Never had the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National hard track, where a long shelf usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michaelson will meet with the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Flintwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12th and the 12th singles match make a bright start, Michaelson’s match may prove decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could have said.
“He fully understood the role he played today, grabbed my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He's a running Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that’s how it was, and that’s how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michaelson will beat Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, though Ferrick said his presence has been of great benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to cheer people up, and he’s a great guy who’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think the young players have had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a significant leadership in the singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn to the unfavorable side.
The Dutchman made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderram, where the team, led by Severiano Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but surpassed the finish line just a little ahead with a 13<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win with the lowest 13<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjorn, who was so impressed on the photo, after watching “Le Golf in the Class of 2018.”
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you will be fully exposed.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no glasses on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and it’s a chance to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
“I have said it without hesitation, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know so well that we are against what we stand against – against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself in this.
We're going to have another test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances will begin, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around your partner when things are going well, but when you stay there alone, you’re experiencing all your professional golfing strengths.
It is this idea that needs to be introduced to the players in order to be fully exposed to tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must do his best as well.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferik himself has spent all this time in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe held the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, brought his players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We built our plan accordingly for the game and set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McIlroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood, and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tour.
“I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that this way they will cover up all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed again.
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like value growth.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery have complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the Bremen-class aging frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies — such as reduced radiolocation, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – there should be the possibility of deploying the latest frigates for a period of up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are already getting old by the time they come into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate hit the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship's operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly critical, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to implement updates in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of holding on to the anchor of the latest frigates are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the naval forces actually “end the stockpile of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been taken out of service, but they were not provided with ships for replacement.
He swore that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could ever be taken up by the fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of flying mice.
The new study, conducted in one of the sites of the Scottish Highlands, aims to show how flying mice use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data obtained will allow a fresh look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help in further activities to preserve the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland, will examine the common non-powders, soprano non-powders, as well as brown long-haired flying mice and moths of Dobanton, inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at some points around the site to track the actions of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities that different groups of these animals are responsible for.
A map of the habitat environment will then be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to determine the main directions of work on habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest land masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of extinction due to construction and development work, which affect their habitat and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting fixtures can pose a danger, as can fly adhesive tape, chemical processing of building materials, and home cat hunting.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use complex echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles on the way to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the issues of the flying mouse population.
Ten trained experts work in the organization, who regularly conduct surveys, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even created the first and only fly-by-mouse reservation in Scotland at the Threadave estate in Damfris and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish fly-by-mouse.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threadave, it’s a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But a lot about flying mice remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a healthy existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking for the presence of bats before performing maintenance within private property, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, herbage or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flying Mouse Conservation Fund, is calling on the public to help.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we just don’t know how many different species live there.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are about to go to court for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the charges against him of rape, calling them "fake news", and claiming that people simply "want to propy" using his name.
His lawyers are about to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Spiegel, which published charges against the footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no.
“What they said today is all fake news,” said Ballon d’Or, a five-time winner on camera.
“They just want to snore using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous, my name is pronounced, but this is only part of their work.
I’m a happy person, and everything is great for me,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file with Spiegel for charges they called “unacceptable information about privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
Having met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but scared one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "a fear that she would be punished" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian giants Juve in a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain regrets carmakers who have been lost forever <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Business and entrepreneurship minister Greg Clarke said the UK would “sadly regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it released almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on international trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, the supply chain will be put at high risk.
Toyota's production line is launched "exactly on time", and parts for cars made to order are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be failures at the border, which, according to industry officials, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store the stock at its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clarke said that the Theresa May plan, voiced at the Chekers, about future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success at the present time, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers also claim that we must be absolutely in a position to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will be halted, but in the longer term it has warned that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s trade union, says the concern among members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to return them.”
A government representative said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will remove the deputy attorney general from office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, in Washington over the course of many months has sparked a mass of suspicions.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeachment of the president with the help of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly in order to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, gave.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into the FBI’s complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
The lead Chris Wallace was interested in why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings was not caused by a “suspiciousness” to the community of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they play in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president is holding more meetings in response to questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without adding, however, precise figures: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, taking part in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity in general.
The president’s frivolous, and sometimes bizarre behavior toward the assembled journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why it is so.
The Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has appealed to EU officials working in the Scottish GHS to express gratitude from the entire country’s estate and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to employees less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of filing applications for status for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of leaving have continued, and this autumn an expected decision should be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario with no deals.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why right now I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery on a head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie had an emergency operation, receiving a head injury on Saturday after defeating 31–27 in a game with Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was received shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the stretchers and taking it for medical examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/degree of injury yet,” and in Tennessee they are trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who only took second place, it was the first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which totaled 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher margin fee when buying real estate in the UK.
According to Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher margin fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will bring down the results of Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters
Raised coat of arms will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favor of the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless - May will announce this today.
This move will bring the results of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more affordable and increase citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the collection of arms will be borne by individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the government's efforts to provide assistance to homeless citizens.
An addition to the existing coat of arms levy, including an increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and housing for rent, may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this move will allow up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to be recovered.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s new properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and complicates the task for buyers who purchase their first home, to improve their living conditions later on.
Many of the country’s elite districts, especially in the capital, have become “ ghost towns” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the coat of arms to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of swindling real estate prices by buying land but not actually using it, and urged Mrs. May to give up the available housing quota to correct the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include control over the rent and the cessation of unjustified evictions.
It also wants to give local self-government bodies more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I dedicated my presidency to the fulfillment of the British dream – to make life better with each new generation.
And this, among other things, also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat for some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the resurgence of the Northeast club, which currently holds third place in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that’s it,” Ross Sportsound told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching my father in Scotland in Hampden as a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will only appear if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Wild Lawyers, David Moyes, Sam Allardies, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gas Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not experienced trepidation before such reputable names in such large clubs, previously relinquishing the offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” the coach says.
“Bringing him out there is not an easy task, but I will consider that I have managed my task only if I can get the club back.”
Ross only worked for three years as a manager, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season led St Mirren out of the bottom positions in the championship winners.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossover,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I honestly believed that management was more than a game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, made a good profit in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still feel a lot of stress at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now by doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”
You can listen to a full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on the radio of Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the results of the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but decreased sales in the networks of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of business consulting company CGA, who received this statistic, says: “Long-term solar activity, as well as more prolonged than expected, England’s participation in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month’s decline, the decline, the decline, the decline, the decline, the decrease, the decrease, the decrease, the decrease,
The June decline in revenue in restaurant trade by 1.8% continued also in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out of the street just to miss a drink.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hotel business analyst, says: “These results continue the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and influence of large social or sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the fall in sales by 4.8 percent per year will be particularly painful due to continued price pressure.
A long hot summer has turned out to be like never before for operators working with food, and it’s not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give so much needed respite.”
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand turnover.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some of whom are just 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of pages of “fake insts”
This news raised concerns about the content of sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” account that their parents know about.
However, one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — create accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts “instance” — i.e. Instagram, a site for photo exchange.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, ran into a teenager there who called on others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is usually secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “Many teens are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.”
Eileen Doyle will become the ‘voice of athletes’ of Scottish light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileen Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish light athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete in athletics. President Jen Beatty claims that this step is a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete at the international level in the last decade.
“Elyde has tremendous respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that her participation in light athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit,” says Beatty.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to becoming the voice of athletes and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, after a sustained stroke lost the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was a boring job, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and today I am doing exercises for ease!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertising of a milking sauce, in which feeding mothers compared with cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The company for the production of milk pumps caused disputes on the Internet, publishing there an advertisement in which feeding mothers are compared to dairy cows.
Launching on the market, it is said, "the world's first noiseless milkshake that can be worn on the breast", consumer technology company Elvie has published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milkshake provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a full silk cowhide under the music track, which has these words: “Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wash, it’s my breast.”
“We run, we run, we run, we feed our babies with breast milk, we run, we run.”
This advertising video, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received a mixed reaction from the audience, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrifics” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken from them within a few days after birth,” wrote one user.
Elvie Milk Soap Dressed Directly Under a Special Bust Galter (Elvie/Mother)
And here’s another comment: “It’s obviously just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk sauce for mothers who leave their children behind?”
Another user adds: “Advertising that is detached from reality.”
Others, on the other hand, defended the film, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great.”
“I think that’s a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have bought one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Ads are a bit cheesy, of course, but that’s how they feel.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “The fun advertising designed for moms who feed on breast (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in the toilets), and who, indeed, feel a little bit “cows.”
“This advertising is not about praising or cursing our dairy industry,” he said.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these inconspicuous mammoths hidden under the bras.
The concept of this ad campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk pump is completely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, and at the same time unobtrusive, giving women the opportunity to move, hold little children and even go out during feeding.
Anna Ballarin, a partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Milk Soap is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
In parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring into the spotlight breast feeding and all its problems, demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk sauce gives.
This is not the first time Elvie’s milk pump has been included in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product on purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children have been moved to a tent camp on the Texas border unhindered.
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for the children to be placed in the caretakers.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents, and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking care of the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential recruiters and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to take care of those who were left without the care of minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
“About 80 percent of the people who are either undercover or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners who committed the crime.
That’s why we continue to persecute these people,” Olbens said.
In the words of the shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of child registration, officials have introduced new rules, according to which some of them must appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days as before.
To declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter and information workers who have appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions such as Tornio, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that if you transport children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare for it or say goodbye to friends, it can aggravate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly.”
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the gathering.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who speak out against President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be assisted in the reconstruction until a political agreement on the end of the war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major insurgent stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who “will be destroyed.”
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in this committee, saying that the commission’s work should be limited “by consideration of the articles of the current constitution” and a warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, if the impeachment and scandal do not prematurely complete his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
And this, without a doubt, will be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness of the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown more than twice – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed the ratings of cable channels, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night from screens.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our comprehension,” said Neil Burr, director of ABC’s drama Nominated Survivor, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-published comedy writer and author of "Just Funny: Some Unpleasant Truths About Entering the Hollywood Boys' Club" offers a different theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's funny!" - said Mrs. Skovell.
In all this chaos there is something valuable – it’s fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, the storylines of Washington’s events can determine the future of Row vs. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world’s economy.
An exception is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, when you're already six hours in a row watching a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" for his book "Fear", or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket from strawberry skin (clothing, softened with pride), or a draft of "Wash", as it says.

When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the northern shore of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during a CNN recording.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they showed how Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee and decides the future of the Supreme Court.

The Outsider’s Money Is Influential in the Toughest Intermediate Elections The White House Is Running
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flow thanks to a change in congressional districts, in which two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another district in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is against another acting official, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of electoral machinations, the old districts were assigned to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate about funding campaigns between the main party’s financial forces – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba became famous in Pennsylvania after a small victory with a small difference in the widely observed March special election in Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then stepped down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama, until the partners expelled the Trump organization’s management team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only in respect of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of the regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to bring about the results of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was perceived as a squabbling in the past year.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to continue, and had effectively discontinued consideration of the issue of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will address it as a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomats have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without taking any new tough messages or sanctions with them from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were discussed by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are also confirmed by a third-party analyst, similar in the circles of the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which is currently very significant evidence in public reports.
Mr. M<0xC3><0xBC>ller is also reportedly beginning to investigate the fact that the Trump campaign was collusion with Russia and its attacks in the past election.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he prepares to address the electorate again, and perhaps ultimately to the jury from among his colleagues.
But there are many “ifs”; I do not mean that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and this has missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the tireless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his inadequacy for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times data is incorrect.
“How will we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or truthful, or if he is still being approved as a Supreme Judge despite the meritorious convictions of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests properly, then this winter will be too late for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to go through them with dignity thanks to the lessons I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to a clash with the football club of the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers take on Vienna’s Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented half-back Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season to a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game thinking we could get something, but we left with no one.
Maybe, in the end, we could have done it, but in general, nothing was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year, given everything that has to do with my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly refined, and the guys really get pleasure from it; the workouts went to "ura".
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide study said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by one of the family members, but they’re not trying to discuss this issue with them,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance Nationwide.
We have to start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for what they’ll likely have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in terms of costs.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life money insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own property provided you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: get rid of the legal battles.
Build trust in health care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists meet your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing financial trust.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts in case you find yourself incapacitated.
And don’t forget about the little ones: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he’s on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you provide information about what medicines he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper, so as to be prepared in any case.
Martin adds: “It’s not just the availability of finance, it’s the choice of doctors.”
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write and write down this plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the outage of communications, the rescuers could not get any information from Donggala, a region north of Pal, which is closer to the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Pula as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pal and Donggal located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county extending along a 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative district of the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular, the coastal region of Donggala.
The production of nickel is also important for the economy of the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency, several tsunamis have been destroyed in the past 100 years in Pal and Donggala.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Acheh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acheche.
2005: The aftermath of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Trac Paylin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old girl from Lasillas, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a situation in which domestic violence took place, and for resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the Mat-Su insulator and will be released on bail for $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unambiguous innocence.”
Paylin is threatened with three small class A crimes, which means he can be released for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of reports of domestic violence and the storage of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after she explained her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly received as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and in the coming days the number of victims will increase.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos with the incident appear.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants to impose a rare death sentence on suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York terror attack that left eight people dead — a rare punishment for a federal crime that hasn’t been committed in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly hired a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" committed serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to achieve the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both of these charges may have resulted in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury read out a 22-point indictment against Saipo, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of a racket, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and crime.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", Saipov carried out it, as described, "in a reprehensible, cruel and criminal manner."
"Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariella Erlia, Erna Ferrucchi, Dianne
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since prosecutors in New York’s Southern District demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents of Saypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated the lack of remorse after the attack he committed.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad that he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to watch the ISIS video on the phone to carry out the attack.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that a decision to use the death penalty, not a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only aggravate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had earlier appealed to prosecutors with an application not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from Tory says Najzel Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should “feel threatened” by Eurosceptics, as one member of parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowen, said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have been "out" if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Ms. May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party, who oppose leaving the EU, are joining a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying his best to preserve his compromise plan, voiced to the Chekers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bowen said at the "Leave Means Leave" rally in Solihull that he wanted to "play around the Chekers."
He proposed that Mr. Farage be leveled and held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to beat the Chekers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely out of line with reality.”
Tori’s Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at a rally, giving reporters such a comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Chekers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and, first of all, electing us.
“Please put the Chekers aside and start listening to what they’re telling you.”
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers remain at work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians are going to hand over the decision made in the 2016 referendum, they need to be forced to “feel threatened.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do this.’”
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel threatened.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving the banners of the “Tories against Brexit” this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can set up IT systems and technology Canada plus, to work on borders, to free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “carefully study” the possibility of taking part in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “carefully study the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told of her future at a council meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in November for re-election against Republican Party member Jeff Dill, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There is talk that she has a chance to take over Trump’s post in 2020.
On Saturday, she held another meeting with voters in Holioca; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a council meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to “go to Washington to “rest” our broken government, and for that it was necessary to be a woman on top.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (armed), LSU player was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who was killed in the shooting, had been arrested.
At 11:00 a.m. in English time at a press conference, the Batton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who managed to shoot the video.
20-year-old Simms was shot near the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Waid Sims was shot in the head as a result of which he died,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stepped in for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wade Sims.
During his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A young man with a height of 1 m 82 cm grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 picks per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Fettell
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, beating Lewis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team tactics will play a major role in the race.
Already with the pole position, Bottas had a good start and practically put on Hamilton, when he defended his position on the first two laps, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go on a pit stop, leaving Hamilton to kneel in the back of the whole group – a choice that became the deciding one.
"Mercedes" went on a pit stop one lap later, and then went behind Fettle, but Hamilton, after some "wheel-to-wheel" fight, came forward, which led to the fact that the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the two-wheeler behind, risking his freedom.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, holding on to his home tyres, in order to finish quickly, putting Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
As a result, he went on pit-stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult because Valtteri did a fantastic job on the weekends and showed a real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Betrayal language of gestures
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Fainstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her assertion that she did not publish a letter from Christina Blaise Ford accusing Brett Cavano of running for the post of Supreme Court judge.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants of these events were “long, nasty and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is wonderful, it’s anger, anger, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Did Diane Finchtain "blown" the information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "slip" the document information? - "What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't melt.
All right, stop.
"We, did we, did we, did we, did we, we did not," he added with the senator's tone.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t leak her information,” Weinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges in the leak seems to have been disliked by the president who commented on it during a Saturday rally: “Here’s what I’m telling you: the body language has really deceived her.
Maybe she didn’t “swim,” but the body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.
Continuing to defend his candidate for the post of supreme judge, which three women have been accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
We are watching the subjugation, the cruelty, they don’t care who they insult, who they have to go through to get power and control,” the president said.
British elite hockey league: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwayne scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dandy.
In the Elite Hockey League game, "Dandy Stars" paid for Friday's defeat against "Belfast Giants", winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of "Dandy".
The Giants were given an early advantage in two goals thanks to the hits of Patrick Dueler and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwayne took the Giants to the leaders.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar compared the score to "Dandy" before two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nilsen cemented their victory.
For the people of Adam Kiff, who won over “Dandy” with a score of 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, when the Giants won three previous matches.
Dueler's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McColl's header with the backing of David Rezerford, after which Boviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt helped Kouni to level the score at 15:16.
Dueyer confirmed that the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break, when he scored a second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the score by scoring a goal with a score of 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nilsen give "Dandy" the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, secured a victory, holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next match, which will take place on Friday.
The air traffic controller died in order to prevent hundreds of people on board the plane from being able to avoid earthquakes.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously assigned the title of the hero after he deliberately went to death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers to be able to safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
Strong underground tremors continue to destroy this area, many residents of the city of Palu found themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the frighteningly escalating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, the city of Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to fly safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the hill was collapsing, he jumped with it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s aviation representative, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter managed to land in Pal.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands of people, as, according to the agency’s information on the impact of natural disasters, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have never been able to get out of there,” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulance brings the victims every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite a serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini, as of Saturday, she has no information about a single male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find the man.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and the crew of the plane after it fell into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday six passengers had been hospitalized and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was not able to land on the runway and landing strip.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane has started to enter the runway too low.
“And it’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses panicked and shouted on board, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the sailors who repaired the beacons nearby also helped rescue by using a inflatable boat on which they took people to the shore before the plane sank under water about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Flight Safety Network show that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane crashes involving PNG-registered companies, but none of these accidents have been related to Air Niugini.
Investigative analyst was able to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the charges were brought against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave long-term testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used recordings from a mobile phone to make a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from multiple mobile phones; according to that data, that evening, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data obtained, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this was discovered, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "It's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to phone records, they only called for a week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale says.
The defence should begin to make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is “a conscious hip-hop”?
Three hip-hop artists are going to struggle with a negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that the content of hip-hop has changed, omitting the initial political and social problems.
The band members want to go back to their roots and once again make “conscious” hip-hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues family couple for racist sms <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A New York-based nanny filed with the family for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that a woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “extreme purpose”.
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two, expressed concern that the new babysitter offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first working day in 2016.
“NONEEEEEEEEEEET, IT’S NOT THAT, IT’S ONE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasko-Flexmen wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her obscenity, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, did her job poorly, and in general that they expected a Filipino, not an African-American, the New York Post reports.
Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now in court for a family couple and demands compensation for a layoff of $350 a day for six months – under the terms of the initial oral agreement, which, however, were not secured by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the accusation of racism, and state that the dismissal of Morris can be considered a reasonable step because, by offending her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t actually mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said her husband, Joe Plasco, to the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude, not wanting it yourself?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Let's go to you!"
Calling the lawsuit “extreme,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child just two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation.”
“And are you willing to persecute a man who has found himself in such a situation?
It’s not very nice on your part,” added a bank employee specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Editors of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, a new letter said.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, recalled the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who reads the work for the first time, even before it was published.
It’s fun to know Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children’s book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would refer to the refusal in a publication with optimism, and added that the 60th anniversary of his book was “both joyful and bitter” as they were not.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as a “very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter said.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not actually consider this success his own merit.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing on the plane, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors vainly tried to save her life.
“He called me regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped acting, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing it was all coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane along with the other passengers, settling down with the huge loss she just had to endure.
“Nobody around here knew what was going on,” she says.
“My head was swollen, I didn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming sense of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are putting up on the Welsh Bridge openings with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he started depression, and at the age of 18 he died with him.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same things I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, it’s as if the light is on in the room.”
However, before he died, he left his job because he was going through a really terrible time.”
It happened in 2014, and Tyler, who died with him, found his brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
As Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these openings, “so that people know that there’s someone you can turn to and tell everyone, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit down and be quiet, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost her husband, Mark, with whom she has lived for 15 years – he did not become one soon after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
It was especially bad for him at Christmas: he didn’t even look at the kids when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, this event has shocked our family.
It split it into parts.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for – an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring at least some unity,” Mr. Flack said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would “split into the background.”
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, everything goes wrong for Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him to the post of Supreme Court.
George W. Bush will call the senators lobbying for the support of Mr. Cavano, who has since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, has met his future wife Ashley, who then worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI announces its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased with Kim.
Since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased, South Korean lawmakers have said.
Speaking to the South Ministry’s data, Pak Bin Seung said that compared to 2,706 escape cases recorded in 2011, this figure fell to 1,127 cases last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korea’s citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a reliably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often places them on a forced repatriation basis. . . .
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the negotiations on nuclear disarmament that had come to a standstill.
This came after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they reached a general agreement on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yun Ho, accused the United States of impeding progress on the issue through its sanctions.
“If we don’t have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we also won’t have confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claims he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave that way, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the accusations of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford in the sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both still teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even burst into screams and sneezed, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned killing of an acting person” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh only confirmed with his testimony that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a preconceived attitude towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by his assertions, and by the way he throws himself at the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when she was asked if she would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or "Road Against Wade" as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
During the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would annul some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time to let the hysterical and prejudiced man take the position of supreme judge and at the same time to shout out: ‘How magnificent!’” says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It is just anger, months and years of anger, she cannot go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 later.
“I don’t think that’s as unusual as you think?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in the leadership position. She told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique with which she explained to her interviewer: “You can think that I’m crying because I’m upset.
I'm really upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men were dominated: I once cried out in furious anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I was always terribly afraid of, and sneezing out.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out of anger.
They think you’re upset and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in some serious intrigue and got out of the race, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to run for president.
“This decision was not as intended,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates participated in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign has already come to an end, it is very late in fundraising, and so she vowed not to participate in the race if it does not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I’m a valuable commodity to them, aren’t I?” she wondered.
When she gave the speech, announcing that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, the disappointment of a system that made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, as well as a curse from the screen.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der about how the press reacted to her.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
“She was crying endlessly?”
How a trade war with America could be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first wave of trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and while the battle is still far from over, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has each time imposed equivalent counter-strikes, recently imposing tariffs on U.S. goods amounting to $60 billion in the amount of five to ten percent.
China has promised that countermeasures against the U.S. will be equivalent each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest setbacks in the near future.
To make Washington back down means to back down, but to publicly back down the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic stagnation in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than has been previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the New American Security Center.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that Syria is “ready” to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking assistance in the restoration of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Raiders Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning the U.S. team with a score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance hit in the water on the 16th hole of the par-3, giving up his match Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st 4th player to ever go 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt suffered a 5:4 defeat by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Turb<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to John Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of eight Raider Cups, has won the tournament in all of Europe’s history with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stand it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won over American golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win — I grew up watching the Tiger Woods game,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, giving up only Jack Nicholson.
The U.S. national team fought all weekend, trying to succeed in vain. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said after his team’s uncomfortable performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to hit Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We are regrouping, I will work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to know how to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news The concentration of microorganisms has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported to be abundant flowering, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinells to the southern counties of Li.
Oaks can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to last week, their numbers have dropped significantly.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week there were reports of average concentration in and near Pinellas County, from low to high concentration in the coastal area of Hillsboro County, high concentration in the Manati and Sarasota counties and in coastal zones, in and around Shkoresh County, in the middle of the county.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a possibility of irritation of the airways.
In northwestern Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
