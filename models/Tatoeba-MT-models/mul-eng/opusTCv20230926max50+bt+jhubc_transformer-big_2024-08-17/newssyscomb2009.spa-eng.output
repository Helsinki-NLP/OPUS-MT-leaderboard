Populist right-wing triumph in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought on the basis of the first approximate results, a marked weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People’s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously undermined.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still is the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the populars who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government wreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results were heard speculations about the resignation of the party president and, until today, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closest starting point of the election results, i.e. of the renewal of the great coalition between the SPO and the OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the peoples negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was an
For this evolution, Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can get colder
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then yes it would certainly come to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized by Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
You can then request the exoneration of the case and wait freely for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
“I advise you to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible,” the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the condemned a "legally competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support has already been achieved by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he insisted before his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The Minister avoided the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I have received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, in it is represented Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
Its chief, head of the Division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes complete it.
Govern this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is larger than the firm ground
Today, coastal countries have begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Shelf.
"Simply, by continental edge is understood the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer borders of the Continental Rim, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it – the seabed area that the commission granted him last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental edge ends begins the region of the oceanic bottom declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says director Mikulka, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors the same as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than ancient Czechoslovakia.
The background there is accidental, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," added Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the command of German special forces was at the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help—the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, in the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force Squadron, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office and the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmans reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because hijackers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately, that moment did not come,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of five German, five Italian, one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed with little to a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked MPs to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or to 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concerns that the state bailout could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record increase in number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the next few months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains the same as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the analyzed information on reservations at 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakening course of the dollar especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The German’s preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with pre-booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the sales volume compared to last year rose again – although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, decreased.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties in the endless Balneario, the beer in one-liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a campaign store.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the TV hostess and wears a traditional Bavarian custom suit.
I have dark-colored hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos – it’s very flattering especially because I’m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you become friends.
The traditional Bavarian dress seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for that.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seem to be casual or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my forehead gets rare looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A nun calls my attention to my forehead that she had dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, the half is the virgin, the right side is engaged, the back is the widow."
Oh, God, now I'm hustling back to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don’t care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wearing caps where it says “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, is from England and is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he has put his glass of one liter of beer next to him that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that's a dumpster.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
At eight o’clock in the evening, groups of health workers run around the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear each time in groups - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covers from one tent to another.
That works like with most visitors: Come sober, come back drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is in the andes.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t anymore,’ a health care professional gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was to become a member of the European Union, the European powers were yearning to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that’s what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and carries two towers, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was over, there is no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curated to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and as the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and stayed out of the story.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suit - men and women - meet in the early morning to make a deal.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to back that choice."
Next, underline a point that almost all of the people I have spoken to so far had almost recalled to me: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to the Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thought goes back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would you be to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey came to be considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Lifes to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As the music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It’s supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang their finale in 1979, several of us were ending 20 years – we just refuse to give up until the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changing being of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
We just have to sing!”
Her wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxed, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical score, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any means, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known warhorses all over the world."
We will miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 economic history studies resumed at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research grant from Houblon-Norman ... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which season he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to miss this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda Super Sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
All this adds up to refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time frame than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million units of jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends to allow this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would amount to a 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly palliate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid – 4.37 meters long – that the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in the month of January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, indoor habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in the access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will feature two 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-liter mechanic obtains a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 laps.
This propellant – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous powertrain, which in the previous generation was 83 horses, it now turns out to be 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘Bee Car’ That Prevents Collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, specifically, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important are the bee’s compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
This detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
"The moment you detect an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected upwards or downwards or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigs, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new collision-instant prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan Vatican will introduce to standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tiemble before making a mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at questionable solvency banks, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
That is, the "Hotel of the Bad Credits"... or of the Troubles.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful, but little detailed information.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house or talk...
Morgan Stanley sells shares to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to acquire 21 percent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market listing.
A week after discovering a tentative deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be based on a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current change.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said Juan Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The terms presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capitals provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to give details about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan had to ease his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market quote fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of defaults on its debt took off.
This cost backfired last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st-century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, his colleagues and friends, is the third to put a draft for a new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of suffrage.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the suffrages plus one had to be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad yes-to-yes victory, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly ", he had said, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution entails an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially by the extraction of oil by foreign companies and by the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to hold up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the Quito-Washington agreement for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the rapists of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane to Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
“They are in good health” and “no ransom was paid” to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell to the power of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an off-shore safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zulu to another.
The group was made up of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the attack the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and they killed half of the hijackers, the others have fled," said the official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan from the lightning unit, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain on board which the hijackers were on board, of which six were killed, among them the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan-United (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letras - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture is headlined and takes place in the current election campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician would dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy care to search history, preserve with little money piles of private archives and preserve archaeological remains.
It is these that are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible cast their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the US market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary, in total with 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s economic competition manager.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves over a year ago, so the decisions made with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered precedent.
According to the decision made early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including mainly the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3>.
The Fortis’ actions began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s market capital is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis’ actions on the U.S. market insecurities in connection with the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously said investors didn’t have to worry, they weren’t going to lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the Henhouse
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies when viewing drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which in all cases links it to the use of the data of recipes to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies depend on the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation for the health status of the customer and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Previously they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing already the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to lower cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company besides the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former does not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already obliging them to do so, although they have not received a penalty for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also drawn up the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data they get more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that entitles the authority to control companies specialized in the supply of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such person cannot deny their approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So that the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union has doubled its trade with India.
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems for the most part global, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit that started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU vice-president José Manuel Barroso, Commission President and Javier Solana, the main foreign policy representative, received Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus, they legally harmonized the existing twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of terrorism – and pressed for the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also tightened, although both sides have great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where – at a bilateral meeting – he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion worth of orders to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A strong presence of Italian editors at the international Frankfurt book exhibition.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book expects more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities Francisco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in the Buchmesse pavilion 5.0: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects about the state of the publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular that of adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found the millionaire missing a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Nevada Sierra area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said in a press conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was given death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) has reported that hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been dispatched that has identified the device: it is owned by the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world tour in an aerostatic balloon: two lone weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world tour by plane and without scales.
Among his records, also that for having flown 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A Suv out of schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in short, Glk the latest born amongst the “compact” all-terrain trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of the content outside of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of Milan’s shopping area, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this ad is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-coloured flags where the militants’ hometown appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put more foot in a stadium.
Good luck!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
“We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” the interior ministry said.
Therefore, “well-opened eyes” especially in view of Wednesday’s National party in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy manner) of Domenico Mazzilli, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior a few weeks ago (he has taken the position that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public safety where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist – adds Observatory No. 1 – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take that into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those are also not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not education.”
