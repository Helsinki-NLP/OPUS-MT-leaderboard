The great return of the Czech smolara is nearing.
Pavel Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois was named to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-year-old Plze<0xC5><0x88> native will be on the switch and could soon get to the gate.
The former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk injured himself in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
It was in the middle of the game with Vegas that he switched and has not played in the NHL since then.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
“Paul the Frenchman will be out for about three to four weeks with injuries to the lower part of the body,” the Denver general said in early October.
His return to the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from the farm, where he picked up four duels and showed off his old form.
In the AHL, it accounted for 94.5% of the measures.
The Pilsen hockey player finally wants to sit down and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had hip problems, and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not capture a single match.
In the NHL <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Franc<0xC3><0xAD>k“ captured 36 games, his success rate is at 92.3%.
Charles wears Camille's dress at Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year’s Christmas wish.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which Camille's shawl helps to put on a dress.
On its website, the British news station reported this to the BBC.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and the foundations with which they collaborate.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears Prince George and Louis shorts and a t-shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate did not mention, it is not clear when exactly it originated.
Last year, the royal family for photography, intended as a Christmas wish, posed a pack of straw in front of a pile of wood in their rural home in Norfolk County.
The photograph, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by the successor to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein was captured in June at Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a dress on his face, helps Camille put on her dress in a color matched with a bright dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case have reportedly been working on the fact that the accused former vice president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was promised a million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he was part of the police records.
Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k, chairman of the executive board of the club, said that the Red and Whites did not allow any corruption proceedings.
The server published a transcript of the police interrogations, in which Slavia mainly features its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended his exile in the summer at the championship club.
A former influential red-and-white official was, according to the document, in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad II, Roman Rogoz, who is also in the case among the defendants.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha officials had promised a million-dollar reward for winning the lyceum, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavia Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The firm has denied any corruption in the case.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the ratios in Czech football and we offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never allowed ourselves to act unlawfully, have not sought to influence judges contrary to the rules of fair play, and have not provided any financial enforcement in this regard," Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said in a statement.
In the aftermath, Nezmar, among other things, indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia's dark skin and also forgives his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The cause of the alleged influence of matches through referees triggered a police intervention in several places in mid-October, including the Prague-based FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest building in the affair is Berbr, which no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, the former sports director Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold war.
The works will be new, but basically worse type (the shooters must come from the armored cabin and carry bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - little and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I have Honitbu right next to town.
From the river came nutrients and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat down and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came out, but of course, the fox went away for a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, he was waving his head on all sides, so I called him to tell him it was on the hook.
Before I got out of the seat, there was a fugue.
I mean, the louka man is a prussian.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be a coincidence a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovisions that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things get to your feet in the bedroom and you should be fine.

Inside, respirators were found to be significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of clothes, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks for their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts on the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why are prices moving so dramatically?
Which agencies were doing business in the first place?
And why did others buy the trail?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> speaks with the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominica Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I respect the soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of the <0xC4><0x8C>SLA, which have been made by the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory war.
We don’t even have large warehouses of techniques that training could catch, we don’t actually have modern techniques for existing professionals, moreover, modern techniques are increasingly more complex, so the skills of depositors will quickly be lost in time.
To this modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time for someone to practice again.
And finally, the depositors/territorial defense are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where he is going to lead the mass guerrillas and this is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, there will be a struggle only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where guerrillas will no longer be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
We don’t have any individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then come up with a situation where you look like a guy who didn't hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago, he's going to attack himself between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you're like, "Tvl, and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course, they're treating him like an average taxpayer.
This situation with this skill to "take the defender away" is so terrible that I've come to the conclusion that I'm honestly surprised when I see that our attacker has been able to play one player to the opponent.
The first vla<0xC5><0xA1>tovka
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major turnaround for the next few weeks.
The surge in hospitals according to statistical models will continue for some time, and a new unknown has arrived, as we know, in the pandemic equation: the variant of the omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the current dominant Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by the previous procreation of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the administration is prepared for the upcoming drugs there.
As has been said, the first molnupiravir is given to domestic patients by Merck.
The company ended up on the tape as the first and also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral horse disease on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
That’s why Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to talking “as our teeth have grown.”
You're going to do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of you will say no.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist whore.
And then they go and choose parties like AfD.
Fear of canceling culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in surveys, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects in Czech are three and quite identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where it is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Hill and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the sssr didn’t want to have a nuclear head on its own territory either because of the safety or the speed of the deployment of the heads due to the more western location.
In these underground covers (there are two in each well) only the heads of not the whole rocket were kept, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit came in and picked up this head and mounted it on some portable device.
In addition to the museum map, the remaining ones are in a state of desolation.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a colleague of Gigan, 4 years we were with him.
He was all right, he was making good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he walked regularly, he devoted himself to sports with us, he did not steal meals or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, made various observatories, but he was fine, perhaps never a passer-by.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the Gypsies entered the same year, the other classes.
In short, they killed the teacher, often solved something by the police, threatened and threatened the other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I’ve already sold often to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to drag me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month ago that he had already rewritten it on himself..
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they do in a decent society (work, work, women don’t fight, just normal behavior).
But as someone comes along, stretches out his hand, houses and apartments, he's just got a mess around him, he's got problems... so it doesn't matter what color he's got, but I'm gonna be sick of it.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start businesses, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prague.
“A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite her resuscitation care, unfortunately she succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” South Bohemian health care spokesman Zuzana Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1> told Pravu.
The accident was probably the fault of the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old Peugeot-branded vehicle driver was probably heading from the village of <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>ovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, went in the opposite direction.
After the collision with <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian police spokesman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Schwarzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The young driver of Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was a number of injuries and he was injured in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in stable condition he was airlifted to the Czech-Buddhist hospital, according to rescuer Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a lighter chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly picking up collectible cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, let’s say from ten dollars higher, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, the order of small consignments has slightly leaked to him, he has to add VAT and post data to the customs procedure.
He gets an e-mail saying that the customs officers are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the shipping information, and if VAT has not already included the trader in the sale, it will be measured by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not ensure the customs procedure itself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments are able to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of consignments received from abroad from 60,000 to 15,000 fell to international mail in Prague on a daily basis.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the calls for the delivery of data that are necessary to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments on international mail that we have to process.
If people were to fill in all the data they need and fill in on time, we would be here about half way, says Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
The solution of inflation
See the headlines, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see perhaps in Poland the reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where it is going?
In my opinion, prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% this year in rough, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Would someone be able to explain to me why the demonstrably confessional rapists send for the grids only for 6 months?
That's just not taking my head as the court can only send such an animal for six months behind bars just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her/his sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And that's not to say that the victim of rape never has to recover from it either.
Wouldn't this even suggest a potential future report of the rape of the victims?
The man from the grave "punched" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb unwittingly helped the guards secure his nationwide sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, on which an arrest warrant was issued.
After all, he invited them to her.
He went for it with an oath.
He first called the neighbor and made up the story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after a call to the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged “stealer” told them he had made up everything to get the guards to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the guards on how to file a notification to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards then found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued.
Therefore, the case is resolved by the P<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slovak?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally famous for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, with the meme of course, I agree, it's a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of the United States of America :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have the Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world if I don't get involved, something like ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one God who does not punish you well if you believe in the god of another.
But even in the wilderness it is said that there is no god but Yahweh.
In that case, would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing badly from those thousands of gods, and the one true god that I just did not meet would send me to hell or to a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a man did well, he could get a professional offer.
Something like this would be appropriate for all the ACR files.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: There is a constant lack of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is some kind of overlap when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one discipline to another, etc.
A similar breach should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or the Mongolian invaders will never break down again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved into stone, we have allies, and you will defend us if there is a breakthrough.
Well, enjoy the poncho.
There is only one election in the United States that will destabilize their budget and the whole of NATO will go to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once again that it is enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that serves as a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today, he can pilot every teenager's remote-controlled means, so it wouldn't work.
We don't need a border fortification, that's fucked up today, but the fattening teenager behind the knob of the remote control will be able to handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home packed with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is being reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That’s why a business map has been created that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed in such a way that they can withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring to the involved store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains at least 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has grown by 50 % over the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling materials are transported to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vek near Brno by individuals who collect at home, but also by companies with whom we have regular bonds of deposited cartons.
We will use it all when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more caring world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for generations to come, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz does not show only the places to receive the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take classified waste from your home, where to hand over past medicines, tires, used electricity, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains more than 100,000 such places.
“The collection halls, re-use centers, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are gradually added to it, which help to find uses for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste,” adds Miroslav Zub<0xC3><0xA1>sek, author of the paper.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills at the same time.
Recently, a problem has emerged (mainly in English articles) that high school students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because whether Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and push everything to one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but especially let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU last weekend – starting in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency’s logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the streets – and mentioned so many actions that they could not reach in half a year.
French politicians like it, and voters like it, too.
Macron’s supporters of the divide between right and left agree on a small one, but in Europe it is.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader said, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is ready for the work of historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to the criticism that Macron is pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, this is rather an attempt to rewrite history.
A far-right candidate for French President <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour is driving France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which cooperated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a single textbook of history seriously, and let’s not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated who in which battle.
However, if they do not have an illuminated office, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "My<0xC5><0xA1>i" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for the director and for the best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ova.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held on the first steps of the spectacular ladder.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having a flu/be thirsty" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't have much taste to smoke...
In contrast to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have a cure for the flu.
(Personal experience only. I don’t say it’s so much for everyone)
The Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas number, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary appendix.
And along with it, there will be cultural tips.
These bookstores, subscribers, we add to this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.
Prozac texts that follow the previous similar collection Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Sellier & Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Bellot.
Another piece of observation of the world and a description of everyday things with extraordinary poetic observability, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer <0xC5><0xA0>est<0xC3><0xA1>k tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be only a desired illusion.
Bohemist and comparator conveys the story of the Red Carpet to the backdrop of the present village.
Her brutal treatment transcends the popular version and grads into the horror of emotional emptiness.
And the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than a man is willing to admit them
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who stayed, and those who left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains are starting to travel according to the new timetable, somewhere the transporter will change
As of Sunday, trains will begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, where instead of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> drah starts to travel RegioJet.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, if necessary slightly, and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the trains.
The sale of tickets has already started during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech railways plan to arrange an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
During the new timetable, the trains will run for approximately 118 million kilometres.
In addition to the national connections, the new timetable will also be extended to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company is deploying dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will travel on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will take the carrier to the north of Moravia or the west of the Czech Republic.
From next year, the carrier will also traditionally increase the price of the ride, on average by 3.2 percent.
Roads take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The transporter here will replace the Czech Railways after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On a daily basis, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>r nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n stations.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the carrier tried to maintain as similar the driving times of its long-distance trains as possible despite the planned exclusivity work.
Without major changes, the operation of trains from Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced on some regional routes.
The changes are waiting for passengers, for example in Czechoslovakia, where on the route from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw via the Czech Lipa to Rumburk, Trilex trains of the German company Die L<0xC3><0xA4>nderbahn will take the place of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to take advantage of a single train ride in the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to die.
In my life, I have not heard teaching from the slave side or from that time on, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will ever tell you in school that blacks often sold blacks into slavery, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I didn’t come across the fact that someone would intentionally silence the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening and I think it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (perhaps in Japan, the WW2 beasts are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about one’s feelings, it’s just what it is, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, when we are already in these southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, North wasn’t much better at how many people today idealize it.
And many people also forget that not all in the South were slaves, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn’t compare this with the Russians, they deliberately ignore some facts, they lie and manipulate, and maybe our view of them doesn’t exist (on YT there was also a video from the TV, where they played someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What made me laugh at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that in some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalized, and those schools supported them how many times.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be a lot older, I'm a little sad that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young people and also in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long since achieved what it had, and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At present, feminists identify themselves as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and lead to radicalization even on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable matters.
The more radical someone is, the more they hear it.
Anyway, in the end, I also didn't face the fact that someone would judge me for colonialism or slavery.
I’d rather meet the wrong geography, but it was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, the concept of nationality as a whole is considered unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something with people brings me such interests, world views and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
This Slovene lighthouse is a very nice guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks some coke about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the Hussite service, because it's theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanicka Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 3 p.m. they perform Mass in Latin, as it was before Vatican II.
Lightning from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – The flame burning in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
They didn’t even go to Vienna to skate for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing.
It was also taken to the border last year.
The light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the department every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said Am<0xC3><0xA1>lie Bud<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a scout present.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually for him, the scouts travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the Diocese Bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel by selected speedboats and passenger trains.
From them they will take over the light in the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames across the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
This year, the scouts must follow the current anti-coronavirus measures.
It’s going on like last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to, of course, wear clothes, try to comply with the differences, it was the least of them, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way that it was as safe as possible, the speaker of the action Zubkoz<0xC3><0xA1>m Z<0xC3><0xA1>z<0xC3><0xA1>m
The Bethlehem Light tradition, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread at the same time as the flame of the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the believer, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of non-existence and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have an economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don’t think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education are making the most of this money, but I do not understand why this money is being given to agriculture, industry and businesses as a whole.
As mentioned - a waste product is produced and it accumulates the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there is a million xy-funded/co-financed project xy hangers on the corridors, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the brake development when this company both adheres to and hires jobs/employees to companies that could grow and become more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in an internet age also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don’t think internet ads will be with me, but then I guess they affected me too – it’s just so fucked up that people don’t always stop at it.
That is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which are currently trying to put a complete ban on programmatic (<0x3D> targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, the words of the classics - I'd ban those Internets.
I have a feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe in something that most people believe and make sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe in something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion that I’m going to claim is critical thinking.”
“I won’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
TV has failed the trend of Christmas movies, their premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinema, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have failed the trend of Christmas movies and this year will present a record of more than two hundred to its viewers in the premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years with the audience is punctuating and significantly increasing the following, which is why these pictures are becoming more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so there will actually be much more holiday movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period in particular, the world-wide are also popular pictures Sam at home, Love in the sky or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
However, the real Christmas picture boom did not start until 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC's server recalled.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time and was a huge success.
This year, the station started to air its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the show, and in total, popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing.
“In this magical period of the story, it doesn’t matter that much, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” said Brandon Gray, the author of the Christmas movie I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movi.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the past few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, TV Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, however, resolves itself skillfully and those two kiss each other.
That’s the way it’s always been, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for Covid-19, he will not make it to the final race F1.
Only 19 riders will be allowed to enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19 and will not touch until the last race of the season.
The Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack for a better position from the 20th inning, which he scored in the qualifying.
However, Russia’s Nikita Mazepin from the state of Haas will eventually not hit the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
He has been tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher making the final cut, the first Max Verstappen to face Lewis Hamilton in a direct title battle.
According to the Haas statement, Mazepin is relatively fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay, because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be guided by the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, and safety will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
With COVID-19, the first racer does not compete.
At the start of the season he had COVID-19 Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, last year he tested positive for Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price list of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It’s a bit like portable jewelry and the creator has put in half a year of work and all of his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at our house the sweaters never wore much,” says Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in half a year.
Hedv<0xC3><0xA1>b<0xC3><0xAD> bought in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2000 ornamental crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has another hook.
"I'm completely out of line, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Lebanon admits.
If it succeeds, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Females, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the help of the NATO state, in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which calls on citizens of the Middle East countries on its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading to the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
“We have now reported further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Police Station is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the region this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National reference laboratory for influenza and non-flu viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that it is about two nurses from one workplace Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, in addition two eleven-year-old students of Z<0xC5><0xA0> Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four of them have no signs of progress.
No one suspected of Omikron in a foreign country

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas to ban abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state by using the legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of heart attack.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the case of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and submachine guns manufactured in California.
Newsoma’s announcement was in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Friday’s ruling that the Texas abortion ban has put into effect, though it goes against an almost 50-year-old landmark ruling that set the right to flat-screen abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue that stems from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack it by the usual judicial route.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (paternal) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be upheld, and to a large extent supported by the Texas manpower in order to protect its law," the California governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” Newsom continues.
His subordinates, he said, were tasked with working together with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would justify the public representative to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
These are referred to as submachine guns that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulation.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and court expenses from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, parts for “arms of their spirit” in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private grievances, then we should do exactly that," the California governor said.
The AP agency notes that after decades, California banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June, the federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas stencil, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayorov<0xC3><0xA1> would be confirmed, who, in a dissenting opinion, warned of Friday’s majority verdict before extending the law to the other state machinery.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant full immunity to the Texas abortion ban against the judicial review and allowed the abortion clinics to continue in lawsuits against selected South American state actors.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and also there is an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Perhaps Israel is already in the big wave of studies on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination will have its own vaccination scheme over time, only it is too soon for this yet.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be on the market soon, which according to the manufacturer’s specification promises up to 10x higher efficacy.

Poland Threatens to Stop Payments to the EU Budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, stopped paying Poland money.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this expulsion from the EU only in all matters requiring unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the joint budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
Its approach to the EU is more radical than that of the ruling Justice and Justice Party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Poland’s judiciary has undergone under Ziobro’s influence threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is building “impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an effort to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucrats who are not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony," he said.
But to admit it... we in Lidl have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn’t look for the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk bars, I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the green and the lactose-free zone...
If there’s no escape, no market, no action, no gold bullion on the square, they may not have such a choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I’m done in ten minutes.
I'm going to Lidl to take a vacation.

For two years, I've been watching how data is handled here like cattle, the majority of vaccine opponents is just a little more out of the bag than the majority of vaccine advocates.

When I was a kid, I was punished for cooking.
It was never because of the signs, it was mostly just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (she read herself instead of going to bed, washing herself with her brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mother always threatened first that if I do it again, I will get hurt (sometimes even after another "sticking" the cake just brought and laid it so that I can see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a few wounds on my ass (through clothing).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable way and to an extent) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, this part is important with a warning, because it gives the child a way of choosing whether to obey and receive, or to improve and the punishment will not be.
For the most part, it was just a warning to me to start listening.
Defense of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl answered a journalist’s question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means for him – whether the sacred document he is sworn to and taught at school, or, conversely, the agreement that is to be reached, will change.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we as a state and its citizens are, and with changes it is better to save them.
And imagine: some nations even like to have their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, they voted on the question of Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing need for a change of opinion among lawyers.
The summer is tested by situations that its creators (whom Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged to) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
All that we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies across history face.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of government consisting of the individual rules that determine the policies of the game's mantineal.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are binding the bans on politics.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with most recently.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Novak<0xC3><0xA1>, the primary of the Children’s Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Faculty of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Masaryk, Pet Dominik.
The process becomes much simpler, lighter, often goes on without symptoms.
But there are children who are ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinics of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes have been on the doctor's side continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects adults as well as adolescents and a few months-old baby.
In hospitals, children are also in severe condition due to coronavirus.
“At present, we have a child of several months of age and adolescence,” the mayor said.
However, I am glad that no child deaths have been reported in the children’s hospital FN Brno so far for the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominica, in the children’s hospital – not only at the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the collaboration of psychologists.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, as in adults, as well as in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is also recommended in children," added the doctor.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not cross the fence into the field).
Skiing/hiking in the forest outside the marked path should not be allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much supervised outside the national park).

China is building the impression of controlled infections and the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Jiroush: China is building the impression of controlled infections and the fact that authoritarian regimes are facing the crisis better.
China has resorted to medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop an infection that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infected people.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aid, and Chinese doctors are helping many in the fight against coronavirus, for example, in the worst-affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, "You don't want an elephant?"
I got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car with a shovel, the children play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend, I'll be fine, it's going to be great.
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: you guys, what did you sell it for an elephant???
The lawnmower, the big shit everywhere, the car broke down, the kids are afraid of him and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says, you don't talk much about elephants, you don't sell elephants like that...
The events of the world are controlled by the authorities.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, they are precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can become such a power only if it is working on its integration.
It still operates at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought so too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a linguist.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and mandarins" when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" in mandarins it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence sounds "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and it does not need to be further specified by the American forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say it again :D
Whether it is so or not, it is a meaningless requirement.
In Tokyo, an earthquake was recorded with a force of five degrees.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and the surrounding area suffered a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings had collapsed in the capital, but no damage had been reported so far.
No tsunami warnings have been issued, according to Reuters.
Vicki Holland from the UK tortures the ape of spaceman Milly
Horrible footage shows the moment the frightened monkey crawled into the toilet bowl before her unsavory owner flushed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed steamers, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
Experts on apes rehabilitation, who care about Milly after her torture, have stated that they have never seen such a frightened cosmonaut.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehab at Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother has admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was sentenced to a 12-week suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life ban on animal breeding, and had to pay a sum of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid herself from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she settles down and is satisfied with her husband, the view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from torture will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's turn came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage of the woman's phone after a raid in her apartment over drug charges.
In the video, you can hear Milly singing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland’s monkey offering cocaine and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (in excess of less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Hollande was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this century three times in a row when you bravely leap through the entire 20th century?
As a first-grader, do you take the same things as a sixth-grader?
And it all kills the idea of buffaloing, when no one, with the exception of honor, cares whether you know it or you understand it.
First, write a test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and on the street people are randomly asked if they can determine the nature of the roots of square equations and coefficients.
They've all gone through this, and the absolute majority of them don't even scratch, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I’m a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need.
And in that moment, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Partly, this is taught to a lot of people who will need it.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all this at the machine stand, I mean, really, 'cause you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly get to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(To which our communist past and anti-Educators and Elites are likely to be involved) However, the price of being barbaric in these machines is simply high.
If journalists were to be able to count, then the covid here probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all-day questions from curious fans, which made her so disappointed at Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Kadrim and Andreou have been doing this since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea moved behind her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! annoyed with Kadri’s reaction to Andre’s accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity was no longer liked by his ex-wife, even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up to her brother.
Normally, I don’t express myself to such things at all, and even in the family, we’ve never said too much about these things.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who's trying to hurt himself in public and screw up the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn't give me that!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite how young he was.
I’m more sorry for having to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would love to meet Kadri as much as I, our close and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrey’s words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, added uncertainly.
The drunk thief climbed the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao started his robbery journey in a parking lot in the residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually took out less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought nothing better than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera is then captured as he walks down the street away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then arrested Chaa.
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on the day of the incriminating day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in greed.
The whole thing is under investigation.
The drinker climbed the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.

More than 60 per cent of voters voted in the four-member assembly elections on Saturday.
On Saturday, people elected new representatives in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mosteck, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves in Liberec and in Equal in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.

A total of 28 candidates were elected on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections were held in the Chamber of Deputies and, above all, very closely watched elections were held in the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vice-President of the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the choice of equipment and personal security was more difficult.
In Komna in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk won the Saturday elections of the Association of Independent Candidates, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member representation.
The candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a two-mandated profit.
Two seats in the representation were also won by the Citizens for Komn<0xC3><0xA1>, their vote gave them 18.52 percent of the voters.
Once again, Jan K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the current mayor of the municipality, who is a member of the Prikromn<0xC3><0xAD>k.
For one mandate in the representation, Kom<0xC5><0x88>ané – independent candidates were reached.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk, the association Pro Rovna won.
It got 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four out of seven mandates.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 went to the municipal representative office.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ica and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ica Association, led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John, again won the elections in Mosteck.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member representation.

The UN received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the correct elections in 2018, gained more seats and has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The results of the elections will be discussed by the National Electoral Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to talk to.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerate, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which in the end was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, for example, the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where rescuers from the regional health services intervened.
The workers of the regional operations center took over an hour after Saturday's midnight emergency call with initial information about the fall of the man from the height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – were immediately deployed.
After arriving at the site, the doctors found that a twenty-seven-year-old man had to fall from a window about 12 meters high and hit his head on concrete!
There was coal in V<0xC3><0xAD>tkovice.
But not as it should be, and the firefighters went to the action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to life.
The interventionist doctor intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and, after further measures in the pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance was transported to another care of the Ostrava traumatological center, the spokesman of the ZZS MMS region, Huk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> reported.
I am more concerned than I am about coronavirus because of inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the infection, doctors and medical staff stand above all.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA has had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things happened.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amandu Nunes, who failed to find the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, showed a great fight against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly threw Cody Garbrandt to technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This led to a women's match between the famous Amando Nunes and Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The American woman entered the battle as a thought-provoking "trump", Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively, and the opponent even scored the push kick that sent her to the country.
However, Penov<0xC3><0xA1> did not allow herself to make any further mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals were rewarded with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> got Nunes to the ground where she began to crush her.
She had to give up and unlock the attack.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier for the title in light weight.
At first Poirier got better, but the card started to turn around.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn’t do much, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got his opponent on his back, and stabbed him with a series of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear-naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the kick.
The Brazilian defended the title, but Poirier lost two years later.
In the next match, he scored the sovereign triumph of Sean O'Malley, who had already placed a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
He then received a series of precisely measured blows and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it’s not complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and thus it is not a problem for them to determine whether the gender is male, female or middle.
Then there is also a relatively large group of significant names, in which the genus is not stable.
Such important names intersect between the two families.
When tilting, they then acquire double limbs and in some cases remain in a non-sloping form.
For example, the words "swivel" or "father" are a genus of both male and female, in which the first are inclined according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For other groups of significant names, different shapes are already in the first drop of a single number, such as: ‘row/row’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambor’ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are scriptural, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example, "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "piper" and "piper", "piper", "piper" and "piper".
Some words, which have penetrated into Czech from other languages, were originally unsophisticated, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is a genus of both male and female, or the word "bufet", which has remained in the middle genus indistinct, but in the male has endings according to the pattern of "town".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people began to flee to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, humanitarian aid is also being sought by the Czech government.
What motivates refugees to take the wrong path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've suffocated, Sydney journalist says
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the local authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government do more to prevent drastic impacts, as critics say?
And what will the climate-change-related countries have to prepare for in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ikou Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why it’s always written all over the place.
It’s uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so it’s trying to prevent it.
I don’t know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how often people behave around them or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has been that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But there are still too many people who leave it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s ugly and flabbergasted in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is conceivable” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual abusers.
Czechs flood disestablished houses, families have no money to complete
Prices of construction material have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people have gotten into a dizzying situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the set-up of family homes, and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already established family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation for them.
In a better case, people move into disassembled and unglazed homes.
In the worst case, detached houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and still pay rent,” says <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek, economist at BHS.
We will build two to three family houses in a year and at fifty percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it’s hard to keep certain things contractually, even if the material has irradiated.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they calculate that the building of the house is going to cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some people will wait," added Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as installation and heating equipment were the most affected.
But construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of the steel industry are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is the brakes of the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're fine, and we'll be even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the Czech Republic commentator – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entry into the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, the Prime Minister and the President of the United Nations, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, as well as the President of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, spoke to the nation.
What did we learn in the first place?
As a graduate comes to me super right, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow the bachelor’s degree, I always do it all year round and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The statesmen are completely at peace with us, if the man is not a total macaque, and there is something left in his head, then this commission will not unnecessarily plunge him into theory.
I may have been studying for a week as a citizen, and when I was finished, the commission always tried to point me to some logical derivation that I liked right away, and I had it right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it many times, really useful, a lot to learn) and then they just learn the project and they are old-fashioned.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the subject there is a test in which the knowledge gained within the project is displayed, not just the defense.
All right, but don't pay for emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same as them.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear P<0xC3><0xBA>.
You need to give it to Xi Jinping to his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing the artists clapping under their feet.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether like, comment or save.
It's been awful to me lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to a tactile where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and don't let it go.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly come along that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy from artists.
Statement of the Donbase Working Party
The alliance – yes, the break-up – no, they express their opinion in the picture against the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
In B<0xC4><0x9B>lov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> pra<0xC5><0xBE>e 8 December 1991 Boris Jelcin, Leonid Krav<0xC4><0x8D>uk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open living position as Mikhail S. Gorbachev<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xAF>v<0xC3><0xA1>t, in secret, without regard to the people
In one stroke, the pen "destroyed" a vast country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even before, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Belo Horizonte Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, halted agriculture, separated fourteen republics from the world’s greatest power, which had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the depletion of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the Arab world, the Arab world, the Arab world and the Arab world.
There is such a concept in political science as “vacuum force”.
Everything that was quickly betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and conquered the countries of NATO that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not have to directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into a Thursday dinner.
In the alternative reality, in which I don’t buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will be left at 99 CZK / kg – will you describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat will become a burden for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and this meat will be discounted 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK track and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
These jokes about the fact that when something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed to be bad, corrupted or of poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
I recently went to Brno to Hlavas and the lady in the basement was distributing some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of peasant reason and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like he was a good matron, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a pity the paper doesn't have to be cut because of this.
I had a similar experience with a former girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to conform to this person because you love him without realizing how much in the p*part of the situation this is.
Several times she threatened to hurt me because I went out with a friend she didn't like to pokecat out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment before, she cried and begged me to go nowhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then it ran for another half a year and began to stab her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her about the break-up and insisting on it, but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some amok again.
Such a person from you exudes feelings, emotions and overall joy.
I'd rather stay away
When the insurance companies here are furiously robbed by the purchase of a cloud of tests and a hunch on the positives, who would not even know about the terrible disease of the test.
The only thing we can achieve is the complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have fallen five days in house arrest.
In the west, they stopped with the schizophrenic and admitted that it is not worth solving the disease worse than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new, and he has to paint something else and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I'm looking at the old good bastard coming back.
After several years of boredom and suppression of this small business, MLM recruitment is back on track.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was a 20-year-old, a first at the university), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "this may not interest you, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and ukecat.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make a profit, he had to blow up several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, i.e., one felt like a contemplative salesman of pots.
What I can say, however, is that the experience was valuable, one has learned that one does not have to jump right into every detail and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won’t boast of expensive consumer goods or a “fabricated” account.
I haven't seen a lot of things like that in a corporation where I'm doing things like this.
HR is calm, managers look at their management and don't put too much pressure on us.
A regular evaluation is something that happens in the form of what it is going on in our country (let’s set some goals for the next year, let’s see what happened and what didn’t) – it’s more a self-assessment than someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - the departments are what are more "corporate".
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so it doesn't bother us much as long as the results are there.
The Czech Republic lost in Britain after its death.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, the British police have been searching for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk was found dead.
The British police this afternoon, unfortunately, confirmed to our representative office in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information on the case.
A sincere condolences, Kulhanek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the 28th of November while on her way from work, and before the show, she had to withdraw money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was announced by colleagues at work five days later.
After that, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What kind of role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected of, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new municipalities were allocated
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk<0xC3><0xA1>, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mosteck, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves in Liberecka and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell under the law, or the number of representatives elected here fell.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
The turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1>, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the representatives in these four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in the 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections were held in the House of Representatives and, above all, very closely watched elections were held in the House of Representatives.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personal security, Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last constituencies were processed on Sunday, December 12, at 03:49 am.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission on Monday and will be published in the Legislative Assembly after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that we have quite a dangerous infectious disease here took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without bigger backpacks.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population on all its layers is built into it, I have a problem with that so far.
I am most excited about vaccination (shit!) because thanks to it I will be finally less dependent on the fact that other people are not a whore.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the ability to acquire it again.
The chances of this really happening are, however, as others here mention very little.
Besides, I'm not sure if the restored file could be considered a treason at all.
Velezrada is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under the age of 35 who are sexless throughout the year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35 who give up sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who have reported that they have not had sex in the past year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a study by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex a less and less priority for young people could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, indicating that they did not have sex in the previous year,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
In people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% of them said they were sexless in the last year.
In free people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The loss of sexual activity also contributes to the fear of premarital contact and religious establishment.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married people under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people share the view of premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that among the free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior moves this trend,” Stone says of those 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, it is the reason for the religious foundation.
Since 2008, the proportion of free people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to almost 60 percent.
Among the “less believers” the trend rose from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline of sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, so they “replace” this need.
This trend has largely stalled behind lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against Covid is about whether a company should force a part of the population to behave that they don’t want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don’t order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can for the death of a closed vaccine opponent who, on the SPD and the CEC side, is blaming something about the chicane and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners are probably part of the second group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will mild winter sign on the fight against drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls of recent times.
The operators of the ski areas will not do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizera Fifties.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about a sandwich.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across the city on a boat, so we could get a boat project across the river.
On the way there we went once such a wide street and in the middle we do not see who - the climbers of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course they've fallen for us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they spoke to a friend.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
“I told them I didn’t have a soul,” she said.
All of us, including the teachers, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're a terrible mess.
Not so much happening, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovi<0xC4><0x8D>
The new German chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is, according to the chancellor, convenient to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the "Norman Group", which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts at (illegal) overtaking.
He and the chancellor discussed further sanctions so that Lukashenko’s regime and his Kremlin patrons would finally understand that we have decided to defend the EU’s eastern border.
According to the DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw was enjoying German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko’s regime with runners.
The drunk Polish lawmaker blamed the accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When she was told by police that she could lose her driver's license if she didn't take advantage of the ride and get out of the accident, she went out with the truth, the TVN24 station said.
She admitted that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to respiratory tests, and after she was found to have more than two clots in her blood, she was immediately given a driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would report her actions to the court.
The dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>, however, did not respect his film.
Czech family comedies have been seen in the American stories about the dogs of lovers.
But they forgot about the main thing: the legality of the film craft.
After the hilarious movie F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, now there's another movie about the viewer's emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> ml. freely follows his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene comes the talking linguist Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava pension, are dying, and so they begin to call into it the dog-sitter, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (who is also the producer of the film) dealt with the story procedures already in the previous picture, but there were at least children and dogs having fun.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the child's desire for dark delusions, and when a thunderstorm strikes, she stumbles with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine – on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course, when the lightning strikes)
Nothing against the pure treatment of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, does not know what a content pile full of incredible situations and the figure was needed for this message.
Two staff thieves, a dog contest, a schumavian charlatan, police officers coming to the show to look for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the ferocious power of a bone marrow – and which the roasted family in the guesthouse of course drinks.
When the hero, after a heavy coma, takes a deep breath and sits down in the back with a cigarette at the family table and demands his father’s whisky and flakes as a cured vegetarian, he can’t laugh.
On top of that, the creator will explain to the viewer that “it happens sometimes after a comet.”
<0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>’s team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of the work with the text, the ability to construct bearish situations, a sense of character and point and direction.
The performance of the game is unbalanced, the cut is effortless and the overall impression is palpable.
No matter how Luka<0xC5><0xA1> Vacul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1> or Nela Boudov<0xC3><0xA1> try to stand their party, they don’t have much to play.
The film's only focus remains on the poetic shots of the forest nature of cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the two tongue-twisters.
It is not enough to plan several characters, a chat room plot and dog stories, in other words, the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters allow themselves to be.
The argument is not even a summer membership in the Breeders' Club - as in the case of Mrs. Producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a person with a dog, the knowledge of the craft must also be if a person wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't work out in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little bit of eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapia, this amateurly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant whims of idiots just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's seeing how shit you understand it, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you were like that when you were listening to the fur, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case a brigade for profit.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The near complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual,” the Israeli Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average in November.
The two-day rain this week was, therefore, rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scenery, the inhabitants of Nazareth were delighted with Wasim A<0xC5><0xA1>kar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are bumpy and irregular.
In the winter rain forests are dependent.
Without them, they dry up and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater source, Lake Galilee, has been filling up on the edge this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has dropped.
Water heaters have been warning of drought for a long time.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a drop in rainfall,” Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Administration, said in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries, such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan, are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are tank cars.
Water pipes and private wells are drying out.
“This year I have increased orders by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” said Im<0xC3><0xA1>d Suleyman, the driver of the tanker.
In Iran’s Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The coryto of the local rivers was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had not brought “no progress” and had informed Washington about the preparations for the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the U.S., is trying to convince Americans to exert their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna brought “no progress” and the world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I sniffed at the lady a little bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wanted for me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I don't really like these scoundrels, I still hesitated for a moment with doubts and questions and finally thanked him and left.
Please tell me I've been bitten, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on weekends, there was plenty of snow and nice weather waiting for them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major effort of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snow at the end of the work week, there is no snow emergency and some ski areas have started to operate thanks to this.
The shipowner did not waive the obligation to prove himself in the course of the Covid certificate.
While haulers don’t complain about customer disinterest, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to the running tracks and to the slopes on the weekend.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are pleased that the opening weekend has really come from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Area.
Hundreds of people went to Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the ski resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk was open.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today there were an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are met.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> Rostislav Proch<0xC3><0xA1>zka.
Ski resorts operators can only sell skipass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after the onset of COVID-19 disease.
Until exceptions are made, people are ready to do so and prove that they have the necessary documents, said René Hrones of the ski center <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n.
"We've only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental rooms and shops of ski equipment.
Fortunately, there is an interest in ski rental.
It’s not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Opava shop Skiopava.
More effort is expected in the period of ski courses.
Also, David <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k, a member of the King’s Mountaineering Company, feels that due to Covid, there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost out of debt.
In contrast to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to him, people became bored with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the renter in the Novako area on God’s Gift.
They started renting the skis there a week ago, and the interested ones now have to order them in advance.
“We’re starting to borrow runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the operator of the area.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school, according to her.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, there must be an opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist medicine, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or a doctor specialist.
There are smart and smart people going abroad who don’t have any property here.
The owner of the company does not really go abroad.
The rest, but I totally agree.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with the victory of Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n one day, the year he ruled, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot be in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election.
If he's going to live here stupidly, then some traditional V4k crazy guy can win here too.
The young and the educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmayer in the blood for the beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in full flow in autumn, in Thailand, the staff of the film Island, led by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor, meanwhile, posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a shooting?
London police are still searching for the unknown Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry a lot about her,” said Lucy O’Connor of the police department in Lambeth, where Srnkova worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and in short wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srnkov acted as a "sister nurse" at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
“We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is not aware of this,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also calling on Harriet Harman to cooperate, who, on Saturday, warned about Srnkov<0xC3><0xA1>’s case at a press conference.
“She’s been unconscious for a few days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course dying to recover,” said a Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Earlier, police had arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
This is not a "massive amount", but about 8% of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are magnifying the threat of the Invasion and is beginning to have our entrance full of teeth.
I was quoting up there.
I don't know what you've decided that Russia wants a war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has GDP in Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the first Punic war and the "anex<0xC3><0xAD>" Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That’s all, and that “concentration” on the border would be the answer.
Yes, I am a servant...
In Prague, from Sunday, a new timetable will be in place, mainly with suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting since Sunday for several changes, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice at the station Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto.
By suburban train, trains S7 will depart, which on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod pass through Prague’s main railway station.
In the newly operated Prague-Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, the R17 from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will be stopped again.
The PID will expand to other areas.
Among other things, there are buses to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tl<0xC3><0xA1> nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Stary Splav<0xC3><0xBD> and Turnova.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with crossings to the Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational lines will be modified.
From Prague Zli<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>n there will be a new bus line 405, which will go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atce.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be reinforced in the morning and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, when the express line number 404 will be released again.
The new PID system includes lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec region.
They depart from St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov Metro Station, not from Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Station.
The 400 backbone line runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Dub<0xC3><0xA1> and <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nové Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikova.
The additional line 410 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Dub<0xC3><0xA1> to Doks, Mimon and Jablonn<0xC3><0xBD> in Podjested<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, a new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of Central Bohemian local routes, including Mochov, Dobr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mit<0xC3><0xA1>l under T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>n.
All trains leaving from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the routes Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and around Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
The buses replace some cancelled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobr<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevska.
The change was made by the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovicka in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are modified.
Healthy lunch/dinner in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don’t have any movement, I don’t have the strength to exercise after work, so I need to eat as healthy and diety as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I buy as fast as possible pizza on the ground and for a meal of yogurt and apple.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
These are not trees that you need to see.
Under the snow, only the top of the tree can be hidden.
If it collapses, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to ride off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of the Gift of a Relationship with Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d: I was not happy about this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business fisherman has been living nothing but the discovery of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da.
They've been pulling it together for years, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent an extensive message to the fans explaining why she has kept her love secret for a long time.
“I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would have avoided the fact that Dara caught a bear, that is, pardon, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” joked Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he beat her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't like, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who don’t care at all and jump on them and from the can, or we, whose lives are thoroughly interspersed.
It’s as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners and were familiar with the count of your mistakes.
That's the judge, you want to, Darre's the trouble.
The two got together in Italy, where Rolins drove for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC3><0xAD>d has long served as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They really went out now because they were waiting for Nedwid's divorce to end.
They have been divorced for three years, but they are not on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
And we are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new man, and just like him with me, I stand with him. In good and in evil, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the others who have commented on all the essentials have already said, I just confirm that the tracks are great in the beginning, my colleagues with most of the time during the first semester or two met and chatted and then found a subcontract together, which I think would be the best option, because you know
The apartments usually don’t advertise too long in advance, so now you probably won’t find that much, but looking at the offer certainly won’t hurt.
Otherwise certainly avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of the <0xC5><0xBD>idenic are a bit ghetto.
In contrast, Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> district is very studenty, the King's field and in this direction it is fine, in addition it is close to most VUT faculties (I do not know where exactly you are going).
I’ve never rented a car, but I’m a native of Brno, so I can probably advise Brno as such if you still have some information missing :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Due to the fact that several doctors have actually decided to do anywhere in Poland, it is actually completely okay that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or go according to the state and pay it to the state.
After all, we can’t let a private actor take control of a piece of education just because a few crowns come to a full-fledged state contribution and because of this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in weight when written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself as saying of a petition for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against whether someone goes to the abortion is the same as the vote against a statue standing on the square?
Your apartment, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (and even for many years professionals) it is either kind of eye-catching, or I write something in a way xxx*** or ... (according to the convention) and to the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd sort of deal with that in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd bet that the author or printer simply created his own character that sits on what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn’t it by chance the Odry Empire (Kingdom) rather than the OdryN Empire?
PSS: Someone's already told you this.

Politicians don't even know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood any text, is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, for the same reason some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for the establishment of super-standard relations.
In addition, with that English it is quite interesting, after the appearance of the GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceylon.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times do I go to work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't crawled there in almost a lifetime.
Yeah, the majority of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is they stop on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D definitely it's not that I would be afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I would go for it quietly.
A lot of apartments are either newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slo<0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without D<0xC3><0xA1>da and girlfriend Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1> like a ball in a fence!
Who will spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit the first candle, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there's nothing to light.
I have seen the gift, and Lucie certainly has some, too, said Bleska, a saxophonist who confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where D<0xC3><0xA1>da remained alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where it's going to be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anikka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slo<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: ZASE SPOLU!
But we were still talking, so it didn't happen on Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something, like a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the bed of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludek Sobota Adrian or the singer Kamil N<0xC3><0xBD>vltova.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt that someone will defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in the crisis in hospitals.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, neither are firefighters, and nowhere else is such a high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava as soon as it goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, it has been asking for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape does not have to be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has died in mountain and sub-mountain areas, with smaller amounts of rainfall recorded even in places where there has been no need for water.
The cause of drought, which dominates much of Central Europe, is climate change.
The impact, however, also strengthens the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes it will be, I can hardly keep myself in the skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and this tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hallucination.
And whether you're a "bear Russia" or "China bats" hockey team so to lose two goals even if you don't have to win at any cost of the game is different than when compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who say what referees don’t pay attention to whether male or female hockey, it’s all strange, but that’s probably the case with all sports, UEFA and “Italian players” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the opposite, it is the same as always, and that already Czechs have lost with Russia more often than they have won, it would probably be the classic "wars have lost" vs "We have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
The confirmed cases in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days are 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest number of days since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an “inevitable” large wave of Omicron-induced infection, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK’s Health Ministry, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
No one has died on the omicron yet, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection and death about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister said the quiz was done “virtually” via a computer.
However, he was involved in Downing Street by a group of employees gathered around the computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous rallies despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial television editor for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won a landslide majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections, which can end Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s 12-year rule.
It will be an election of European importance.
How long can we expect them to be fair?
It wasn't fair.
They will probably not even be free, because such were not the last two elections under Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote in practice where they want to.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain unified opposition.
That's a big deal for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n and his side.
Won’t they be able to keep playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
She recently escaped to independent media the recording of the president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> K<0xC3><0xB6>vér, where she explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you’re talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news.
It all starts with the language.
I was bitten quite often, the last time at 14, my mom's parents didn't have much patience, I didn't either, my dad has her long, but then she bounces extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I was angry like a little terrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, it was about 2x taken in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I was bullied, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely now have a tendency to deal with things by violence, as a child I was washing myself quite, now to get myself into at least something dirty and as a young man I have to be parents so flat through the hand maybe (if I didn't get a lot over the handle), so I'll never get anything extreme, but I'll never get anything extreme,
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure that education has its share in that, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with a bunch of kids, too, and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just wants something, maybe it's not possible to give their children that little bit of it to them.
It doesn’t bother me at all, I don’t understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call the kundamas those who make the laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have what mortgage to pay for?

Where will Slovakia move the trial with the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main characterization begins in the trial of the four-time accused of the murder of J<0xC3><0xA1>n Kuciak and Martiny Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the tops of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the process for Slovakia be?
Journalists can do a lot about this.
How is it possible that this petition had a greater media attention than the antidote of the Deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
Anyway, they let it go, and the company ran out of it.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka's proposal needs to be substantially reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at the end and the law, which was to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in selecting and allowing deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the negotiation of a proposal submitted to the Government after the air raids by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities involved in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on the storage facility, which has been promised to the authorities since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law by Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka, who has the Platform at his disposal, particularly excludes municipalities: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given location.
This can be ensured by the storage management’s obligation to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed case-law almost completely ignores public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the licensing proceedings.
The design lacks a system setting of compensation for the municipality for the entire process of search and selection of the location for storage, its authorization and operation.
The representatives of municipalities really do not have much opportunity according to today’s legal norms to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place to store.
Only in some licensing proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or minister decides in whose interest it is to issue the licence.
The action in question shall not have a deferred effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The self-determination that the Platform requires is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and subsequent to the contract with the lawyer Jan Zem<0xC3><0xA1>nk.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is almost 4 million kroner.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Cejle municipality of Hr<0xC3><0xA1>dek locality and spokesman of the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who are aligning the position of the authorities towards the state authorities in the search of deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we are only pushing away.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such an important building as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The anti-subsidy platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to implement changes in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further maintains that the decision to select a location for storage, if any, is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) made to lose the fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he did not need to change anything in his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't die, he'd die.
And that's what it took.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
His new character was praised in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat one from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crumble.
"I put it all in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit down anymore," Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also matters what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college one, I might be looking for ways to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Maybe a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, yes, and so the "boss" is something like a lord/ruler given a level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not required to defeat at all to finish the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games of the type Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly hit with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be named at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It can't be translated in one word or another, Czech or any other language doesn't solve it (the only thing that's interesting is Catalan, which translates bosse as a final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for a story or game, controlled by a computer, the opponent is stronger than all previous and watching the completion of some level or task.
The lost Peter of London searches the whole world.
Czech police were also involved.
The missing Peter Srnkov<0xC3><0xA1> has been searched by British police since December 3.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk has been looking for her since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow ring for her.
After Peter, the whole world is looking for him.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokesman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlov<0xC3><0xA1> confirmed.
“We share information on the case,” she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, it is thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She's supposed to come from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
In the search for Peter, the local MP Harriet Harman also took part.
She was involved in hanging out the flyers with Petra's face.
"We're very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have already detained one suspect.
It is not clear who he was talking about and what he had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October pointed to a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is meant to draw the user’s attention by a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month it had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair of the bills for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Esset.
Spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, the attackers do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November have rather captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands for almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe file, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant declines and attenuation of activity are evidenced by security analysts at the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic had no major offensive campaign in recent months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated assholes.
The Prague crossing was bigger than the media said.
According to the footage of the walk along the coast and in my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid of the estimate of about 10,000 people.
On the way, people filled both the coast and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of protesters are spontaneously added to the march of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokr<0xC3><0xBD>.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to their finding a common speech.
Only the anti-vaxxers, the anti-Russians and the spol. would not be able to complete or pay such a great march.
The actions of the Chopin Dog Association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of a Million Moments for a Democracy at the Edge.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It’s hard to say what movement this dissatisfaction could take away from, depends not only on the contribution of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a square and more dose.
It certainly won’t be a left or center movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose one, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm so glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, for whom humanity is rightfully proud.
At the end of the leg, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned the creation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue to change that won the November elections.
This has already led to the establishment of a broad coalition government that should seize the office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties reporting the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the "secret" footage taken is a global hit.
In Britain on the weekend, fears about the fate of 32-year-old Czechs have grown, after which London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srnkov<0xC3><0xA1> was last seen two weeks ago when she drove home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the child hospital worker, she calls in addition to the police and her previous employer or MP representing part of London, where she lives.
“Petra’s disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry a lot about her,” said Lucy O’Connor of the police department in Lambeth, where Srnkova worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and in short wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srnkov acted as a "sister nurse" at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
“We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is not aware of this,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Kocourkov<0xC3><0xA1> (and also the regional pirate town hall) told anonymously that his drawings violate copyright.
However, the court admitted that the paintings of Krte<0xC4><0x8D>ka do not violate the law in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk.
In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem a month ago, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it said it did not respond, the hole wanted to go further.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to “resolve the situation intensively.”
