The social card of the residents of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the retention of the benefit of travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for the organization of preferential travel of citizens with the use of social card of residents of the Ivanov region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia on the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of social card bills in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social card of the residents of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changed.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in the winter - no more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, the owners of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the rest of the money.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff valid for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card by cash remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to take a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card with accuracy to the kopecks.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the listed but unspent funds.
Let us also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier the budget.
No commission will be charged if the money is entered on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road Administration and Transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget for providing preferential travel of citizens with the use of social card is provided for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher confessed to murdering a friend
During the 911 call, a nearly drug-free university professor Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his friend and that he needed employees who would come to his home.
Lamb stressed that there is a "dog" in the house that is alive but probably upset, and said that contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note written carelessly by hand on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm sorry, I wish I could all go back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
There was no indication that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where, according to the police, he shot all the respected Ithaca teachers.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said the university's officers learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call at 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, there will be one more victim: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the officers of the bodies were still trying to put in one picture of the motive behind the Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped to draw up a portrait of a talented but perhaps worried teacher.
The students said that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gotha, where Prentiss was killed, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he had intersected in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 lecturers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lambe, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed anxious and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to provide him with a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university rules of admission to work meant that the degree of doctor, which Lamb worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the position of teacher.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot from a 38-caliber reloading gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with a working engine was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb started working at a university with 3,500 students in the city with a population of around 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in Educational Sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun person.
Karla Hearston said she was 15 and Lamba was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a classy older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success in women.
All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Harington, now 40, who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss, by the time of the events, apparently have been meeting for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goth in a brick house, the opposite side of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Former Prentiss husband Sean O'Stin said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online at various companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gotha, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and a harmonica for the vocals.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
"It's just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and stared at each other.
I mean, they were both very smart.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, held seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English language teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
About 900 people, including university professors, staff, students, and community members, took part in a memorial candle-burning ceremony at the University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare authors of the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus, in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana, New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that Lamba's call came into service 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamb and talked about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while a toy retailer for children assures that it will give staff and temporary employees the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, which is less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start conducting interviews with applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few more months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough state in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about a date with Princess Diana <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for her personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of the members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was suffused - Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in the trailer to the soon-to-be-released documentary show.
The movie begins, and here it comes to my mind that I am literally at a distance of my hand and in one fake candle from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back in the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film “Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” says Spielberg, “it is undoubtedly the greatest film about travel in a time that has ever been filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” for nearly five years of conflict, and that arms growth would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Xi Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the disagreements in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities "made the situation unsolvable."
Mr. Gi Moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in resolving the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some people tried to put a provocateur’s jar on him.
The others turned away from him, perceiving it as a joke.
Some people are calling for a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to sway Donald Trump’s high standing in the polls, they haven’t (yet) managed to do so.
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump’s advantage in two-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for real estate magnates in terms of chances to get a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate himself to the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his predominant popularity to German Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would start fighting in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeff Bush’s “Super-Committee of Political Activity” and the economic conservative group “The Growth Club” recognize Trump’s unrelenting strength and begin to get their dollars to push him away.
Here are some numbers of surveys that say that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings for Trump’s sympathies turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now in favor of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators get top in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would vote for Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “with enthusiasm” or “satisfaction” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “excited” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next on the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "unsatisfied" or "disappointed" if the establishment's favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his arrogance and insults, 52 percent of Republicans across the country think the magnate has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll showed on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective at posting, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When they put on their hats of acquaintances, Republican voters think that Trump is serious.
When asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of everyone else.
Some hints indicate that such a split is likely to benefit Trump, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among the more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical “one-on-one” competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He was ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeba Bush by 19 points, and finally Randa Paul, John Kacey and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
Is it the only candidate that gets through it?
Ben Carson defeated the businessman for a total of 19 points in the hypothetical “one-on-one” competition.
A little more than half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll, conducted on Tuesday, shows that just over half of Trump’s supporters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration, according to the report.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his opening campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in the talks in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s potion will deter key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The government's disappointment is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday said in a new ABC/Post poll that they would rather want a political outsider than a person with experience working in government.
They are also blamed for Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are disappointed by Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent being "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "crazy".
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Holodots said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the savings pension of Russians.
The hunger striker noted, the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
That’s about the same as the full pension index for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair what society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options of balancing the state budget.
Why do they often get irritated and redden centuries?
According to ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our ages are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that reside on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleansing of the century, we often ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The output is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet napkin for centuries;
at least 1-2 times a day clean the end of the century from the harmful substances accumulated in them for a day.
Cleaning procedures are necessary to complement and warm compresses with the openings of healing herbs (shale, groin), which infuse the thick secret of the saline glands, and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out with circular movements of the finger tips;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secretion of the salivary glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear weapons have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities said the country’s main nuclear reactor, the Yonbe nuclear complex, was working “at full capacity.”
A report on this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready to respond at any time to "the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", as well as that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "by both quantity and quality".
The latest test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that it has managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has conducted tests of medium-range and small-range missiles several times, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem a mention of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that a reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long gymnasium, the longest in the world, even athletes do not stand,” Zhirinovsky said.
The Member believes that it is necessary to remove all four-year-olds that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem needs to be changed to "God, the king of storage", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but whether the root causes of this problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible for people to die as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel safe.
“In this way, we can reach a consensus, but we can’t achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
Some 500,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is not excluded that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently stepped up border control to curb their influx.
Some 800,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the figures significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
Bi-bi-si correspondent Jenny Hill has been to Darmstadt, whose residents provide migrants with a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at the Prime Minister's session
Following the election of Mr. Corbyn, the Prime Minister is expected to make his debut at the session of questions with great anticipation.
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour Party leader, will soon be speaking at the Prime Minister’s session for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six issues raised in the second half of the day; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as the leader; it will take place after the appointment of their shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Unions Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during the national anthem in service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, sparked criticism from a number of Conservative Members of Parliament and became the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr Corbyn’s press secretary said he was “standing in a respectful silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.”
However, shadow cabinet member Mr. Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economics, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the MPs supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements are also “scattered” in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn’s appointment to a position in the European Union and the government’s restriction of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Unions Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party had "full clarity" in view of the fact that it was only in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron at the Courier Box in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, said he had “attracted collective resources” to raise Mr. Cameron’s ideas of questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the County of Eilington North said that the Prime Minister’s issues are causing excessive confrontation, and that he will refrain from both thoughtful answers and the exchange of amounts, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, poverty, and poverty.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on Prime Minister's questions when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak out when possible, saying that he had appealed to Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to discuss the matter.
Having become a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to get away from the political style of the "Yarmar Bagan", often associated with the Prime Minister's affairs procedure, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leader’s views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has become a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.
"Dream in Johannesburg" Homeless young people who have learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.

The pound sterling is growing as wages grow in the UK.
The pound rose against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to a proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June earnings in the UK, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to earlier forecasts of possible quotes growth.
The pound sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, the shares of SABMiller were allocated, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase proposal received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite the two largest brewing companies in the world, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from a competing group of luxury luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – in the key market for Burberry – began to grow again.
Glencore shares grew by 5% after the mining giant said it was able to get $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s paper and packaging group shares were the leaders of the fall in the index — by 4.3% — after Goldman Sachs lowered the group’s rating to “sell.”
Shares of JD Sports grew after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent increase in earnings before tax for half a year to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries Can Prevent Expansions
JD Sports CEO Peter Kaugill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such a purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Downward Campaign to Fight Aldi Pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier on the initiative below launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming influx of $700 million by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food vendors and promote the IGA brand through social media.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as Danish ice cream maker Simmo's, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to regular customers at the matches of the Southern Football League.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 – the day that this wholesale supplier of food, beverage and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
A lot has been put on the horse, as in South Australia and Western Australia IGA-branded stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the USA and 24 percent in WA in the same way.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will cut 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales volume from all players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kirat believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 stores in WA next year, reaching sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products at high constant costs could cost the company about 13 million revenue before interest and taxes are paid, according to Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, lead stock manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “may most likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglas’ comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash’s board of directors contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The share of IGA in the market declined from 18 to 14 percent in 2010, and Metcash’s revenue from the food business that the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers fell by 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operating dividend and due to pressure on sales and sales figures.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to level retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths by a thousand positions per week and helping IGA retailers redesign the retail space, as well as offering a rapidly expanding product range and more fresh produce.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the price leveling and refurbishment of trading spaces is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Hilli
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and for his behavior deserves more respect than critics, says Tennis Australia President Steve Hilli.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often referred to as the "Special Ks", was involuntarily the center of attention due to Kiryos' shy breakup with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee at the top had to distinguish Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison stated, "Vavrinka had to put on Kiryosa's blades, and I have to put on that blade.
C. While Kokkinakis was last seen breaking the missile after a collision in his leg saved Riskar Gasket from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilli loyally defended Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in the singles final in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
“I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely the fact that the Tanasis have been drawn into conflict,” Hilli said.
He really broke the racket when he set foot at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes broke, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he has mastered very well in quite provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he fits in well with the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's trained intensively, he's in excellent shape, he's very focused and developed young man, and I think he's worth it.
Hilly also backed the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing a "dealing deal" would be the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus completely on the match, not on the disputes around [Cyrios],” he said.
And I think that Nick came to power very quickly, that people like Federer and Marrey proved, he grew up in the public eye, he made a number of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces state of emergency, closes border, detains migrants
In announcing the state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday crossed the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those who tried to enter the country illegally to keep migrants from floating inside.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants flocked to the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
After being stranded for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke down the tents and settled in the area.
However, the dissatisfaction has increased.
As a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police for a special purpose.
Some in the sign of the protest refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister has announced an "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the solution of the problem, not a co-injury.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Waves on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear the overall responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached, according to which the member states of the European Union will receive 120 000 refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit to be held next week to discuss the immigration crisis that engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect urgent action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in the two southern regions, announced on Tuesday, gave the authorities more powers to act on the crisis, allowing them to cross roads and speed up court cases on the provision of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Seiyarto said his country was also planning to build a fence from the cords on the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work to complete the closure of the cable link between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “close place” and crossing point of the EU’s border for migrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants looking for a better life, not refugees - victims of military actions who have the right to protection, and this point of view in Germany is sharply divergent with me.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) fence from the looped wire, built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include corduroy for longer.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> told reporters in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Formal parliament still has to sanction the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been monitoring the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Deird Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said 45 people tried to cross the border at the border and another 15 people were inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently under police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, pushing for the blocking of one of the crossings of a railway wagon wrapped in a loop.
The riots erupted on the main passage across the border near the city of R<0xC3><0xB6>sk<0xC3><0xB6> (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed an office space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced a food and water ban until they were missed in Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-pronged advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders pursues it.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary election, most Democrats say it’s too early to say they’ve decided with the candidate they’ll support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than they are in favor of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democrats under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on par.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton defeated Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in the group.
Nearly half of the primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, the views are more contradictory – only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question as to why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent) and then that she is now a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for that position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about the association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
Because the vice president is considering potential participation in the election, 57 percent of primary Democrats would like him to join the race — though a third believe he doesn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among candidates from the party, the primary Democratic voters in most cases are called Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would have chosen Biden as their second choice, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden with a big lag in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question that is most important in the candidate, Democrats choose other options in addition to the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities. . . .
Biden of the three leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not believe Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no definite opinion about him at all.
The primary Democrats also generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail box and server continue to be her Secretary of State, the majority of primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on this account and believe that this has not adversely affected their overall opinion.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this was shared in March, shortly after this story became known.
The majority of Americans say that the controversy over email has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton believes her party’s voters to be honest and trustworthy, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month’s, and 15 points lower than last month’s.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not believe it to be fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good marks in terms of leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush showed the best result in honesty.
Most see an honest person in Sanders rather than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the election of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates garnered half the votes of voters in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson went up for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is supported by all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Casic, have turned back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Hakabi and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place together with 6%.
The margin of error for the election of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus- minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll, published last week, showed Carson’s growth in polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to the increase in Carson’s support last week, Trump has made several critical cases to the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having cast doubt on Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of a freshman from Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was brought against five people.
“The members of the P.I. Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York attacked Michael Deng violently during the September 2013 dedication ceremony and did not bring him to the hospital on time, which led to his death,” the police said.
Officials say a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back pushed several times as he tried to achieve his goals by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the P.I. Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited an hour before he could be taken to the hospital, police said.
They, however, found time to change Dengue's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above the health of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received several blunt head, torso, and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of the fraternity rituals, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fyerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Counties of Monroe have bowed to charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against the novice and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all of this officially or unofficially, then so is it," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will continue.
In particular, for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a total of 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the U.S. Central Bank is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much adjustment will take.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the dirt around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of “cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, in his commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the U.S. to be more normal, but still lower levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how certain areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of raising rates can lead to instability for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t look like stock earnings are slowing down by 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years has changed more sharply - around 14 percent - in the direction of raising rates, remains fairly equal within 250 days after that (average growth 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal state of the stock with the average yield of the stock, the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock, the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the last
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and the earnings from shares are beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often play a role in them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the entire duration of the existence of an elevated rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the rate increase since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP was less than 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few believe it was long, while in the third quarter it stood at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question of "will this time be different," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, while their views are tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could have approved an increase in rates at this meeting, futures trading is only 25 percent likely.
“In our study since 1950, all cycles of rate hikes to the present day have been in a super-cycle of increasing financial leverage in GDP, covering pre-recession peaks, very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it has been 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect comes faster than for shares when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rise/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, bond yields immediately fall,” Deutsche reports.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will result in the yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds coming closer, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we’re still afraid of fluctuations in returns,” says study analyst Katie Jones, a fixed-yield analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a tougher monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, yield curves were more flat, credit spreads widened, volatility increased – all market characteristics as the Federal system’s policies tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their core business in the U.S. will benefit from interest rates hikes, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt more expensive - in the financial.
“The story shows that “quality” stocks demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a stable financial position were outperformed by companies with an unstable status, with each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, averaging 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yield, as well as stocks with low volatility also showed better efficiency than low-quality stocks, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big question.
Companies with a high interest rate of floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see a profit through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - copy of Classic FM", - affirms member of parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "decreasing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also went on to win the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply a nod to Brits.
A colleague of parliament, Damien Collins, who stumbled upon The Voice with the same criticism, was not the original.
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the leader of parliament said, prompting the radio company to prove that it is doing at least something that commercial companies don’t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's leadership that the public radio station appears to be "stupid" and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to turn into Classic FM,” he said.
He also went on to win the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general has denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music will actually not be compared to anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC to have been attacked for attacking commercial competitors during hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of parliament from Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for a target price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to a lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Palom Feit and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it will launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to block the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or use the money of those who pay the license fee to other entertainment formats.
The growth of internet sales slowed as much as possible in August, and it may be the fault of Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015 there was a seven percent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in the year 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping.
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could have contributed to curbing spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are signs of online sales alignment now, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, rising by just five percent.
Experts say that there are now signs of easing online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkey, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales were intensifying three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so in any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it goes to the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in the amount of five times the average rushed to computers in order to manage to take advantage of profitable offers, thus breaking down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real fight for profitable purchases, could have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 of every 5 pounds is spent online.
As for goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims buried dead in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden’s family is sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 people killed on the streets as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the crane collapse at Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funerals captured the passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead, who went on their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed past the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the roof of the mosque and fell to the parishioner.
The bodies were handed out for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died in the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque were carried on the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Kasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left an arrow of a crane raised under a non-working crane.
In the Arabic version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, it is said that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English news agency’s editorial office did not say the details, but said the company’s leaders had been banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane fell in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia’s closest ruling families for decades and has led the largest construction projects in the world.
The late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was the son-in-law whose family resigned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in heavy winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million riyals (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount irrevocably to the deceased.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing.
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country

They say the British put aside hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out work in the house.
If you are able to deal with a hammer or gently paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in a minority.
Because, according to the company-owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform difficult work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home improvement services, said that this trend is behind a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master goods, and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by representatives of the weak sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households made up of single women who are more engaged in the construction of their homes than in the past, cannot be ignored.
Ms. Lori said: "Our stores are still predominantly run by men.
There is a need to take steps towards achieving balance.
In total, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the leadership of leading British companies, whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving the same number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is hardly the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the closing costs of the stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in half a year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching meetings held by the Federal Reserve Bank, in which the most important decision is discussed within two days - to raise or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists, conducted by Reuters, found that just over half of those who still thought the Federal Reserve would go for it last week now believe it will still time and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but it all speaks to their confidence that all odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" - hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Horghos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to skip other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them, to bypass the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now headed to the town of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure a humane attitude towards them.
This is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone will cope with it, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade has asked Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is indisputable:
If someone is called a refugee, they must fill in the necessary documents for this purpose in Serbia.
And if he does not do so, they will not let him into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre-long fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to raise the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maimarakis: “Europe wants to help us”.
For a number of years, Wangelis Maimarakis was part of the centre-right governments that led the country to the financial crisis, according to the left.
Now he, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, is challenging Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by subjugating the Syrian coalition, but now, according to polls, the “New Democracy” has been compared to it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Maimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras threw them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this affected most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that in the event of an election victory, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syria.
Vangelis Maimarakis: The point is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not by chance that in all the other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement a programme by which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party has voted in favour of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Wangelis Maimarakis: We actually voted for Greece’s movement on the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences the country’s exit from the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost without a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr Tsipras’ negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year wants to establish order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments made by the government, which can not be fulfilled, will be fulfilled from the beginning.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to benefit from the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers’ income.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cypriot ministers had never spoken about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Wangelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We are moving forward with reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price set by the Greek government.
At the time, I was the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of three parliamentary groups that made up the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences over key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations going on outside.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, there has been a massive influx of refugees across Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Vangelis Maimarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-moving bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syrian government did not act in this situation as follows.
In such matters, action should be taken in advance, because if the problem reaches you, only emergency measures remain.
And we are in this situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced Syria did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which is given valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who is calling for the EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the positions that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control, and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this urgent problem.
Euronius: Mr. Maimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka Donetsk region during the day of the criminal search of the main guard of the police of the region in cooperation with the military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kryvoi Rog (Dnepropet), who was from the city of Svetrov,
A report of the 22-year-old boy's injury came from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-sectional gunshot wounds to the legs.
As Artem Vasytsky, deputy chief of the criminal investigation department of the police chief of the region, said, during the course of operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the participation of the figure in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day, a conflict occurred between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to the man’s head.
The Investigative Department of Druzhkovsky NGO opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Imaginary murder" and "Imaginary infliction of serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years of imprisonment.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the Donetsk region police said in a press service.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments of Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to prison.
Two other residents of the city have been sentenced to imprisonment.
The people of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts were given a 14- and 18-month restriction.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism in relation to the monuments of Lenin, which were located on the territory of the KPRF and on the street of the Trikotazna, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory".
In the latter case, the missile installation "Katyusha" and the tank T-34 were painted.
Recall, on the night of December 12 in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown people painted in the color of the Ukrainian flag military equipment at the Monument of Glory.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov Irina Leonov gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Let us remind you that recently the Gypsies and Leonov broke up.
Yevgeny declined to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions.
Yevgeny Zyganov is 36 years old.
He is the actor of the Moscow theater "Masterly Peter Fomenko".
He is known for his films "Walk", "Cosmos as a Precept", "Brest Fortress", "Ottapel" and "Farza" series.
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" according to the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta State left a note of apology
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he would "sadly" tell the first murder, and would like to "believe"
Police in the city of Goth, Mississippi, reported that a geography and social sciences teacher at the University of Delta, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, “I killed my wife last night,” and also mentioned that there is a “dog” in the house that “doesn’t touch anyone” but is probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
Upon arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found Amy Prentiss's body there, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which read: "I'm sorry I'd like to return everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Having written a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when surrounded by police, he died with himself.
University rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite the news on Monday that Lamb had proposed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported the "lack of any information or evidence" of the "love triangle."
Prentiss referred to her as the "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stin said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and that she was "comfortless."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Lindsey Knowles, whom the San Gerald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Noulz said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called his relatives to say that "he will not go to jail."
In the evening, when police reached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university’s website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from the University of Delta State.
The Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), has survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his lifelong companion Farru Fossett, who died of cancer.
It is reported that the actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for storing drugs.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, due to which he will not be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gale hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless run of Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before going to the hospital.
Van Gale said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he'll be propelled.
It’s terrible – the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started playing fantastically, and that’s where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican.
Van Gale believes that the Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
In his tweet, Shaw wrote: “Thanks to everyone for your messages, not to describe in words how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United are in an accident with Luke Shaw when they lose to PSV.
The English defender will have an additional incentive to improve to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, coach of PSV, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When any player gets out with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Netherlands under Van Gale at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s very hard right now because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, you feel bad,” Koku said.
I couldn’t see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in another direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn’t see the paddock under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
I am very sad and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about "Lorax"?
Every parent very quickly absorbs one thing: if your child liked a book, it will take a while before you get to know it almost by accident.
Unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to the question of a representative of the company that organizes children's vacation in the holidays, about its favorite children's book, the prime minister chose "Larks" - a fairy tale with an environmental twist, written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because we always find something in it.”
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to the storyline to diversify the story quite nicely.
"In the high-walled town of Allmnuzhwill, where there was no green and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dream, fulfilling her wish - to see the real text in the owl", - read the same.
If this does not seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost like a short exposition of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded by high walls the city of All-Munichville, where everything was artificial and even its air was sold for money.
It seems improbable that Cameron, being, in general, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how to destroy the surrounding environment, a greedy tree-cutter and a novice, a novice, a novice
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the performer, who had never read the child's book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street said that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comments were received.
For Adam Lita, there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but it’s still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tournament, a repeat of the defeat in the Test series with a score of 3-0, which happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out a win on my field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes players who virtuosoly take turns, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the 2012 scars, but only the adolescent positive.
With the ball Moen Ali turns into a bowler who delivers the ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt is out of the England Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Litt to me, his head coach at Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that the players in cricket are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said that before) the players are the best to choose themselves.
The couple were half-hearted, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, had a good reaction to his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression is a complex question.
Litt played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and in a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Litt was in best shape, but this missed opportunity was in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman I appreciate very much.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moana next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, keeping four speed bowlers, is thought up, and I’m not against it at all.
I don’t see the reasons why the batting player can’t beat the ball there, and this left has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for your county of Wustershire, but he became the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred straight and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my short communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics – an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball – and think it’s a risky bet, but among spinners who vote “for” a little, and the selectors chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardine, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring in the richest experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is involved in those games where white ball is used, and will provide both energy and ruthless pace in the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s a game or a coaching job, and like Mahala, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Col. Collie's teammate Darrem Ben Stokes was left for a day, Ruth was given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not experience any problems in this regard.
Although not everyone will agree with this, the coaches and the players who select the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Britain’s exit from the European Union could be a victory if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s unthought-out policy of resuming Britain’s EU preservation talks is increasingly complicated every day, even without looking at the choice of the brilliant Jeremy – “Is it yes or no?” – Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party or the outrage of the EU.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained yesterday that under the situation in which the EU is now experiencing various crises - not all of them of its own making - some of the participating countries are stuck on the throat of the UK's egocentric agenda of changing concessions and concessions.
Gathering in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn’t want them anyway if they were to destroy social protection.
We could even call it "the Selfie program of Dave and George."
The prime minister and finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in a company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to keep Britain in contact with the outside world under the European Union’s banner – “Don’t leave us with France,” says Berlin – suggests that the ministers and officials in some of the capitals should be left behind, or we should be able to understand when they are all right.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation gets worse for her, as she has deteriorated for those sitting in her place, Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is ahead of a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses his strength.
Poland can soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them jumping from the skin out to help the “selfie brits” whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they also don’t want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style scarves during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the UK’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was a fixed idea" and "Britain received nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans are in trouble knowing what a predator the Flint Street can be, and how sceptical about the EU are the media magnets, unlike the time the Tony Benn referendum was launched in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-opportunist who was famous for his “direct EU bananas” of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a handful of companies out of the fearsome taxes of jurors, phone hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the exact same opinion about them, but was reporting to himself that when you’re in a cell with a big gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair had come up with principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which was issued to him.
The press didn’t forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who snuck me on my back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he no longer has time to spend it on me — seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnok’s “Medoka Boycott” strategy from the 80s — and that’s a mistake.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalist Ukip trend and a wider circle of "little England supporters" among the Tories can probably say "yes" to this.
It’s the same thing that Hillary — “Benn, but not Bennite,” Benn said on radio and TV this week, while his internal boycott of the campaign was refusing to admit that appointing Corbyn as John McDonnell’s “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-in-law was forced to throw himself on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labor Cabinet, not going too far and not losing his post in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any circumstance” — Benna’s phrase — is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. told peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
No matter where I want to report a Democrat and his "boy" Corbyn - remember, he even shook me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the watershed of social networks, the abyss of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to give Cameron such a simple break from Europe, allowing him to accept the support of the Labour Party during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s main misconception of membership in the EU – within the framework of the “Bennit” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism, born of minor distinction, is a central tenet in the past.
As for his blunders about Nato, Tom Watson is indecisive that J.K. will not agitate for a way out – foreign diplomats will have to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions, when all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during a luncheon at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The agency’s government-funded statement that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than smoking was echoed at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published an important report – a “turnaround” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, they criticized the "extremely shady argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “solid or muddy grounds” behind them.
Martin McKee, professor of the organization of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: "The fundamental principle of health care - the rules should be based on
According to them, the public expects that PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” were based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to generalize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the field of health in the report on sustainable development.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of e-cigarettes, not to mention the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation of the choice of board members was not provided, but among them there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which also stated about financing the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in the tobacco industry.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco sector at PHE.
The paper, published by the group, “extremely agrees” that there is a lack of “heavy evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria,” wrote Mackie and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were covered in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s statements that “at the moment there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a road leading to children or non-smokers,” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Wellness at PHE, said BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two people who smoked all their lives died of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what these evidences prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking amounts to an NHS of <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly indicating that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only part of the harm caused by smoking, we are doing our job to the nation.
Former Channel 4 boss says BBC company should stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chief executive Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would pay a lot for such successful shows as a soap opera about Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create such programs that are not issued by other British broadcasters.
He has criticized the BBC for putting on public broadcasts, which are likely to only watch a small portion of the audience, at a peak airing time when competitors go on a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to work more closely with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessful in trying to work with the BBC during his time on Channel 4 for six years.
“I can’t separate from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast broadcast broadcasts that could show competing companies not receiving subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s finding out about the future fate.
If you keep a license fee that I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should leave on the air only those programs that are not being released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is airing in prime-slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
The other channels would certainly have given a lot for it.
I don’t know how it can be public broadcasting.
I don’t think it would have made the BBC any worse.
Series entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings “because of employees’ ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows are echoed by comments from Sky CEO Tony Ball, who in his 2003 lecture on McTaggart's memory in Edinburgh suggested that the BBC sell EastEnders-type series.
Johnson noted that the more niche broadcasts of the BBC of a public nature "continue to go to the BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the khanjean sermons, justifying the income from the four-year-olds.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Speaking about the licensing deal, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds is a lot of money, I'm curious, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita’s mission in favor of “informing, enlightening and entertaining.”
He noted that only a small portion of the BBC's material is now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto "of foreign exchange and foreign exchange.
As for the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Changed Concerts" (only some of them, according to him, shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement at a time when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of motion at a time when they are affected by sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulses are impacted by activation of neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Next Next post: Researchers manage brain activity with the help of light
Scientists have said that the worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new method called "sonagenetics", the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to stimulate certain cells of the brain, heart and muscle, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salco Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure that uses electric pulses and pulses in the human brain.
The nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Intensified ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some intestinal cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to that used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass unhindered through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery there is no need to pass inside the spinal cord.
“We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal for a while,” Chalasani said.
He added that in addition, the method can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising Ads Are Cheating on British Arms Trade
See Amnesty International’s video with a protest against the arms show.
Shocking killer drones!
Destroying a naked iron candelabra!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise indentations that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
Bold voice and cartoon animation leave no doubt that this ad security of the largest international arms exhibition is a daring parody, prepared by Amnesty International with the aim of attracting attention to the intention of the British government to "pull" the weapons into repressive regimes.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters on bus stops and on subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - was written on one of them by the London Underground with an image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will warm up on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms exhibition.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exhibited their work in the "Hard Design Museum" in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
The group, called the "Special Patrol" Group, helped spread them across London by using the "pick-up of advertising sites", a 6-pound set of hook-and-loop keys that is said to "give access to about a third of the advertising space on bus stops."
London's transporters were not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP, working pro bono, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the ad silence around the arms show – with a pass in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s let them set up a campaign that they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating a more realistic and ingenious corporate ad, but “filling her house with bright colors and animation proved to be a more exciting activity.”
“They’ve incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition goes from the inside of ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about an order for "AT4CS RS to shoot from the shoulder" received from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no analogues of a cumulative warhead, which brings an unsurpassed reserve action within the target.”

8 golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in beret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve upset — and the numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can vary from a slightly acting on the nerves to an absolutely frightening one.
He encourages me to talk: to tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin, and why you are "honestly, I don't like, I don't hate Marmite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract.
Forward.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people you like, not those you wouldn’t even talk to, even if you had a fire extinguisher and they would fire the fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into pubs, half-timbered cinemas, and public places, but they’re also the place where people dress up and fix their underwear.

Introverts in universities are being treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, however, many dormitories form a culture of shading from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendly relationships.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent in communicating with you.”
Try to feel when the student is tired of communication - and not to bump into it, but to send SMS.
By the way, about the punch: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knock on the door to people to introduce themselves and present a plate of chocolate cake, - it's no longer such a strange action, it's not like the 1950s, it's going to be with you, it's going to be good, it's going to be good.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to talk to you, and as a result, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Poorly blinded pieces of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be sleeping when you fall for them.
The theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken is theft, but isn't it theft - to take a little milk for tea?
Deal with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he'll suggest you don't be shy, even if inside he's frowning with anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it annoys, and I pity you - but try to treat it as an adult than my neighbor, who poured liquid into his milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the gossip about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to make the sound of the drum and bass guitar beautiful, since she was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he was finally silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then she broke her music and locked the door behind him, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extraordinary, until you bite the elbows, no matter if you accepted a neighbor for your future husband, got involved with them, broke relationships and should see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you won't tell your heart - but if a hot neighbor is not exactly your future spouse, try to cool off your own dust a little bit.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the scratch and the bruises is thinner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but turns into the opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson about safety by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone else's door and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't stick someone else's stuff with a Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to Install a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Releases an Update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, selecting General, and then selecting Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered post-installation problems when an error message appears, telling them that "App update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival is quiet, or to try to update through iTunes.
Tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution with the help of a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when performing the update your phone is charged or is next to the charging device so as not to allow battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the phone’s discharge in the process may lead to an update failure.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called on his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad’s administration by Russia creates a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal – the fight against extremism – if we do not continue to focus on the conflict.
They also noted that Kerry once again underscored the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said they do not know exactly what actions Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that the phone call with President Putin will go in our favor, it will be in our best interest.
Barack Obama himself believes Russia’s decision to increase support for Assad’s regime is a “lose rate.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation got worse," he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev commissioned a number of agencies - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the creation of welfare
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad – about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the European states’ courts for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes, and providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, Lashkin said.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, the meeting of which took place in September, and as a result of the discussion was also approved by the report.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release on importation is in essence an advantage.
Therefore, after approval of the protocol of the meeting of the sub-commission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkin said.

In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestiam" told that the mandatory regulations on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria were prepared, which provide for a simplified procedure for the design of small-scale and sporty molluscs.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure of measures of small-scale, sport sailing and walking vessels in the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the waters of the sea ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of coordination, - noted in the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the State Auditor, classification and certification, state registration with respect to small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are engaged.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area the rules of the border service are extremely strict: in order to get out on a yacht, you need to make a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht is not even going anywhere.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then the problem arises where to take it, says Denis Novikov, the sales director of Nordmarine.
As for the places for storage of yachts, there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Also yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank granted a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the statement said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimyao Fan, said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate economic growth recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and in the World Bank are observing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan is calling on the government of Ukraine to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
In prisons, they are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council of the Federal Criminal Enforcement Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite communities in the colonies.
This “Izvestiam” was told by council member Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicted non-sex offenders in Russia, it is possible to provide individual cameras, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that to determine the execution of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicted will pass the relevant medical examinations, which prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite party.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving the sentence.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, it is the only way out to work with such criminals.
Clearly, they need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is a suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of the transvestites is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Hryb.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with an indeterminate sex, you need to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZOs are definitely not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
According to Hryb, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then the incarcerated transsexuals will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are included in the SIZO at the scene of the crime, so the income of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects in the course of the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - Grib believes.
Recall, on the eve of the law enforcement officers were unable to decide in which investigative insulator - male or female - to determine the detainee for the storage of drugs of 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which the man was not in custody.
He was released at home on a non-departure note.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the mechanism of transgender content in SISO and the colonies in Russia is not really there yet.
Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places to serve the punishment of transgenders, noting that it is also possible to define the people in the colony - their husbands - from their husbands or wives - from their wives.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it’s a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals,” says Alexeiev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexeiev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to commit themselves to transsexuals in order to get into a different colony from the usual one.
Of course, you can enter a medical certificate before you place people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything happens unequivocally.
For example, in the U.S., one of the inmates, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison, said he wanted to change the sex, Alexeiev said.
A man can feel himself to anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for serving the sentence for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and break into the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of the sentence of the convicted.
The commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it is not a single test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s opportunities for psychiatry allow this.
Therefore, even before sex change, potential patients always undergo such examinations – they accurately show whether sex change with surgical intervention is the necessary measure,” says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicted, because on average, such an examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating individual blocks for transsexuals was supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if you take into account that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, it can be said that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and still commit crimes, a very small number, - said Lordkipa.
Now, on application to the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgenders and so on can get separate conditions of content.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world chess championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the World Chess Championship among juniors until the age of 20.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to push the Polish Yan-Kshishtof Dudu, who seemed to be confident going to the title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa celebrated the victory for the girls.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who gave a series of 13 skirmishes for the win (sores) was defeated.
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the drawn break seemed very insignificant.
And even when Duda cut the turnovers and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the lag to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, in order to reach the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, beat Duda to his party.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could have come to the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently managed with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party to end with the Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player led to a confrontation with the Dutch by a draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
That is why it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, whose governor Natalia Komarov, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the competitions of the girls of the intriguing conclusion did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian girl Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch Buxu.
The Russian athlete remained second with a distance of 0.5 points from the champion.

Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the Ministry was against indexing 10% tariffs on freight transport and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by OAO RZD.
At first, they wanted 17% of indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion dollar subsidies from the budget,” he says.
We say: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.

Minpromtorg: Addressing food aid will not be an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of addressing food aid will not be an analogue of the map system of distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern address food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic producer of goods.
I ask you not to speculate on the wording of the food card.
I would particularly like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food cards with the emphasis on the past times of the total deficit, the card system of distribution, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," - said Mr. Evtukhova.
Earlier, I wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the underprivileged was introduced into the government.

The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business lending market in January-April of this year declined by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic moods of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, the volume of loans of SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans below 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If previously the bank could put at an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, then now it is impossible to do this: rates and so cloudy.
For businesses, the current level of rates on MSB loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their affordability.
The 10-13% rate would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form attractive returns on them.
How satisfied do you think the demand for loans from entrepreneurs is?
After the decline of the Central Bank interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of money.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to modernize the equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy supply.
All of this, in the end, allows the company to make the products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the ICB lending market that will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the reduction of the average rate will depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of the reduction of the key rate.
However, the radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes the necessary higher interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the central bank rates are lowered.
If we talk about the level of latency, then traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited in both the possibilities of replenishment of funds and in the options of correction of economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
Both the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other model of the brand: without boredom it is attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japan, simply because of its "Japaneseness", is able to bring attachment to the products of the country of the rising sun to a state of complete delight.
It is possible to bring arguments in favor of cars from other countries as much as possible, and even in principle a person will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will be separated from the final phrase: “But it is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also everything else Japanese.
Citing from Basa's walk, cooking Vasabi's food, collecting katans and dressing his girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation from school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But the shape of the car changes much more strongly the new pattern of headlights and taillights, on which the car instantly learns in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
Silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance has an attack of rigor.
You won't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese tranquility.
A diesel engine with a volume of 2.2 liters provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped exclusively with automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black jacket, black bag...
To add to this image a little black humor, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to make sure that you don’t get behind the wheel of the CX-5 in place of your own DTP.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has been reworked the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sockets of the front lower handles.
The complete drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds decreased by 13%.
The bathroom in the flowerpots or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
Another thing is if the girl grows up in the bathroom with the original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing fighter.
She will then get the attention of no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even the long legs will surely appreciate the fact that the supports in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit on the ankle in the expressions.
Mazda’s widest set of active safety systems is available on the CX-5.
In order to identify a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There is also adaptive lighting, and a warning of descent from the strip, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, with a minimum of performances, it places a load of 561 l. The rear seats are in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate carry-on handle - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 l.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi".
It is especially tempting to look like kigurumi-pyjamas.
You can do anything in it!
Of course he's sleeping.
But also - to entertain small children.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - fun clothes, behavior or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev has broken up the nuclear union.
Kiev has officially formalized the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday, with the second attempt, still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project has not been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law repealing the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block on Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill passed by the country’s government has only been passed since the second vote, first supported by 210 deputies with a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was laid under the Soviet Union, was supposed to have four 1 GW power units with VVER type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries Kiev began to twist relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project of construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where the relations have survived remained the purchases in the Russian Federation of fuel for the current Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity production in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" will replace Russian supplies.
Plans to build Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively refused: back in 2014 in Kiev announced talks with the Czech <0xC5><0xA0>koda JS.
United Nations General Assembly against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP said in response to a question about Syria’s military support from Russia.
Mr. Gi Moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolay Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of establishing a future air base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, U.S. officials said the U.S. did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said military assistance to Damascus is necessary to combat the Russian-prohibited Islamic State terrorist group.

The OSCE PA reported on a possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE Artur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentaries to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “to return to the normal activities of our countries”.
On the question of whether it is possible, in his opinion, at present, to dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group on the platform of the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to politicians, any kind of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions in principle at the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The party's mandates have been extended.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections in the city Duma on the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were made by representatives of the KPRF, who accused the election of "covering falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the cancellation of the fees for the capremont of multi-apartment houses.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the district commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six deputies in the pride count Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizavete Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shaluygin.
Now, within five days, these candidates will have to determine whether they will work as deputies in the city’s word: in the event of his resignation, he will move on to the next candidate on the party list.
Gorizbirkom Chairman Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he is introducing duties to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" for the purpose of refusing mandates.
With the adoption of the protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF reported multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the Gorizbirkom with the right to vote, suggested not to acknowledge the results of the vote in the four districts No. 21-24, recalling that at the command of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the building of the administration was closed, where it was located.
Neither the deputies of the Gos udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could pass inside for a long time, and the resonance scandal with the crash of the doors of the radio administration was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the Commissions with the right to speak had the opportunity to attend.
The head only gave them access when the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet come to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," - said a member of the mountain Electoral Commission Natalia Andryushin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristova, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that on the day of the election, a number of UICs began to seal the polls at 6-7 a.m., putting in them ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right to speak and the observers did not give notice, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations in the urns could uncontrollably throw ballots.
However, the mountains, which have already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, have not found any violations with the throws of untaught bulletins.
The members of the commission and the proposal of their colleague from “Just Russia” Maria Popova, through the lobbying to go out with the amendments to regional legislation, did not support the time to open envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the ballot box.
"In order of your own initiative, please contact the CIC," - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, KPRF member Sergey Samokhin, who shouted that the electorate ignored dozens of complaints and covered up falsifications in the elections, collapsed with loud accusations.
"You're not here at the rally, make a more careful statement!" - offended the chairman of the election committee.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the electorate must approve the general election results, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Lower Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city electoral commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" in the registration of an initiative group for holding a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the parties were going to put two questions to the discussion of the Nizhny Novgorods: do they agree that the fees for the capremont of multi-apartment houses should be "immediately cancelled", and the tariffs on housing and utility services "frozen until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the legislation.
The FedEx revenue is mixed in nature, a decrease in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported uncomfortable results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant cut its annual profit forecast due to a drop in demand for freight services and an increase in costs in its land transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares were down about 2.5 percent on pre-trades in 45 minutes before the stock exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts suggested $10.84 according to a FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite an average rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will come into effect on January 4, and an increase in fees for ground transportation of heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year, thanks to a reduction in costs, an increase in gross income and an increase in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "worked steadily given the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade."
Plans to hire a workforce at the holidays were announced the day after a competitor’s statement, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they took on work last year.
For the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The earnings per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share held by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the sector of urgent international transportation, which has led to a lack of gross income growth in its express transportation division.
However, the online shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from ground transportation increased by 29%, but operating revenues remained unchanged overall due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express-transport division received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to increased labor costs.
At pre-trades about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange FedEx fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent – to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week behind a 27-foot table of the Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated room for meetings of two floors above them will hang a walled image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third order could prove to be an unknown factor in an almost-anticipated decision to announce on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by an almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows a confident growth of the economy, recent shocks in the global financial markets can hold the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by just a quarter.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsey M. Peegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what to do in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Roughly half of economists, recently polled by Bloomberg, predicted interest rate growth this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from doing so, while the key indicator shows only about a 30 percent probability of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow by promising that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was spurred by expectations that those defining the federal system’s strategy will leave the stake this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Federal Reserve’s leadership does so, “they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as this would ease uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems to have tended to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the resilience of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects the rate to rise this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August has slowed, the growth of the labor market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s target of 2% per year, the Federal system’s management said the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
“The economy will also be able to cope with higher rates, and it needs them, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Schefferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average index for industrial company stocks fell by as much as 16% in a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in China’s economy could slow global growth.
The market partially recovered its positions this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10 percent below its May high.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, the market upsets further complicates the difficult calculations of the rate increase period.
“In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would start to spin the hooks at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal System Reserve.
Now, according to his predictions, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the consequences may be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Federal system, and it should not be taken into account technically when making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint from then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system could “absorb” its monetary expansion caused shocks to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state-of-the-art strategies.
Jeffrey Lacer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been cases of overreaction to financial market movements that seem unrelated to economic principles.”
Lacer, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the U.S.,” Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the federal system cancelled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic and closeness did not approach this level, he said.
“Of course, you wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re afraid of rising rates because markets are experiencing shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act in the past has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and as long as that does not change, I do not think that they should precede events.

State Duma spokesman Sergey Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees are floating in Europe.
As Interfax reports, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is it not Europe that is the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years with such maniacal persistence?" he asked.
“For surely, someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and helpless people who are saved from death, will be aimed at the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many European political leaders openly spoken about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally crippling their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with the rare exception, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO denies many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and unbiasedly looked at and looked at how the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are being broken down by the military junta sewn by NATO standards,” he said.
Government forces and their loyal militarized formations are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the banned terrorist group “Islamic State” joined the opponents of the Syrian government in Russia.
The United States supports rebels who are opposed to both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria called the reason for the West’s dislike of Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are, in fact, that they are sovereign states.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, “Russia 24”, NTV, “Russia Today”, TASS, “Interfax” and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, which will act in the interests of Western countries and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized by the Zapa”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves – at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Commune.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, or else he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that cooperation with them is being carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied the claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them in the presence of a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Silicity coalition known to the United States,” Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition is conducting air strikes on ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people were killed by the floods.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people were killed as a result of the flooding.
Another one is thought to be missing unwittingly, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed several cars with the people in them in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the stream suddenly reached it.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All the dead were residents of the Colorado City and Hildeville areas, which were hit by lightning.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in search and rescue operations.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the State Department representative John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.
At the same time, he said the United States has tools for “further isolation of Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar Assad, RIA Novosti reported.
As reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during the conversation with Kerry, again stressed the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating in the territory of this country.
There were also discussions on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow’s strengthening of Assad’s support.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are protesting the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist organization “Islamic State”.
The U.S.-led international coalition is subject to ISIL airstrikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a curse on Strelkov.
The former head of government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
The note in the Washington Post is great because everything there is quite twisted.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "went out" he from the territory of the republic of Donbass in a very raised mood, without ropes, without three furs of money, which are attributed to him by different characters.
According to Borodaya, the talk about Strelkov in conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really went.
“Yes, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” – said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "linked".
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left on his own," Boroday said.
"It's a curse to me and to Strelkova," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post appeared an article in which the words of Boroday are given that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to link his partner.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with gold from the Nazis.
Polish foresters began to cut down trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Within the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship Tomasz Smolarz suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to shut down the search area.
Three days earlier, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Peter Zhukovsky said that local treasure hunters with a “99 percent probability” found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in legends.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the gems will be discovered, they will become the property of the state execution, while the treasures will not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhy with the message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief narcologist has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Yevgeny Br<0xC3><0xBC>n noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly harmful".
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station "Govorit Moscow", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of a ban on the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A man grows unevenly.
You can serve in the army from 18 years old, a person is physically ready for this.
He is mentally ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
“It is known from the scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21,” said Brune.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Trust Russia" Sultan Hamzayev told "Izvesty" that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
Resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On protecting children from information that harms their health and development”, with a statement of September 16, the correspondent Sib.fm met.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible in the shop “Chitay-city” on the Red Square, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that, in his opinion, violate the FZ "On protecting children from information that harms their health and development".
On 16 September, the application was accepted for consideration by the Novosibirsk Prosecutor's Office.
The response to the request of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, it is quite a fundamental problem that will engulf society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio-Grandi Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Food for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for a full-fledged diet during breast feeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of infants, suckling breasts, arranged by images in a row.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one calorie increase isn’t the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy eating for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system has been found.
Under Hamburg, the train blew up a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus, which was stuck on a railway track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing she couldn’t get off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, there was a collision in their eyes.
One of the students filmed it in the video.
Due to the emergency situation, there was a panic among the students.
Some of the children began to cry and run along the horizon.
The route has so far been blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured, except for one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the version of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown got into the hospital with a brain-tissue injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life-sustaining apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He had two children.
This is the second death toll among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of a ring injury.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this type of sport, but it is better, from its point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally," said Stephen Parnis, vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, such situations will always occur when an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads either to death or to serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practicing doctors and medical students. . . .
Sergey Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma speaker Sergey Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shame and of ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us return to dialogue and the right to practice international communication.
Let us return the humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
“Trouble has never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the tribunal of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our interparliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also said that the OSCE should be respected.
"This is almost the only common site where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan Bator and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
World champion of light athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal for the 24-year-old lightweight athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
He managed at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to win at the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly - to become world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "Brillian League", taking third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkova to share the impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War II Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will already think about rest.
True, I will be at home preparing now, in Barnaul, and to be at home is a completely different state.
It’s easier than it is to wander around the world every week.
You have said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passion after the main start of the season has faded, the burden of responsibility no longer fades.
You can compare yourself to pleasure, to "relaxation."
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming soon...
Is there tiredness?
The season is special, a lot of positive emotions.
Fatigue by the end of the season is always accumulating.
It doesn’t matter what he did more, he won or lost.
Every competition is a stress.
Constant flights, movements - all this does not happen for the body indiscriminately.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy there!
By the time you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's happening.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I believe that the bad athlete who lives with the old victories is twisting his successful races over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and you have to move on.
Is the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the rallies, then at home again.
All as usual.
But with the coach, the task was set: to try to get to a new level that I have not yet been on.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying the foundation.
We ran a bunch of crossovers, did general physical training exercises, which included both a pull, and a seat, and a back we jumped.
Then they were accepted for barrier training, a lot of work was done on the technique.
What are your competitors doing, watch?
I always try to do it, the good in the age of the Internet has no problems with it.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought, “You have to do something to get this company off the ground.”
With each start this season, you added and added in the results.
Did that give you confidence?
The last few seasons have been pretty much the same.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 first, and then 13.50.
I always change my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run away from 13 seconds.
All work was directed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you’re ready for the races, and at the competitions to show your readiness is not always.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not make it to the final. - "NI") tried to forget right away.
Gotov-to was very good, could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at that point, he would be the bronze winner of the Games.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
How's it going?
It was in Tagus.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And he ran straight out of the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to tear and wear a broken head means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" at that time!
How do you manage to develop a decent speed, not to lose even your head, not to turn off?
And this is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is so much easier.
And the saddest thing is, when you have the feeling that you are running and everything seems to be working on itself!
Honestly, it’s worth it.
Many of our athletes from deep within after the first serious successes are striving to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's still better at home.
I can't imagine where I am without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I’m trying to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together for a long time?
From the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
Actually, first I was training with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with the sprint, then jumped to the length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when they shoot the ball, jump in length from place to place...
At 14, I tried to run with the barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race, it was possible to comply with the norms of the second adult class.
That's what's left.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
Somehow I managed to get along with them immediately.
But there was always a lot of work to be done on the technique.
How much he suffered from a single stroke!
But this routine is nowhere to be found.
The technique needs to be constantly traced - so that I can wake up at night, I immediately got up and would run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful race.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't re-watch my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency – there is no limit to perfection.
Don't be afraid now that a year before the Olympics victory lies on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, it must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you’re not weak, you shouldn’t feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread - give it to the enemy.
And while I wasn't waving the flag, and I did, like, say the same thing a million times here, and I didn't directly call anyone a bastard, I did another job.
All my pseudo-friends were washed away, and in a second they evaporated somewhere.
The pressure that I'm putting on is so strong that even I, who's been putting out guys, think people are white.
The Buddha walked, walked, and you were attacked by a crowd and you were mutated with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm from the hood, I'm old, guys, afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so taste it.
And to give passports to such assholes as Fred Derst or Monson, can only be assholes.
I'd rather not be ashamed of my job as a journalist.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply characterized the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula was a crime.
This is what is called an annex.
I believe that the reference to how Khrushchev tried to sign something, in no way fits into the general picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor's house and taking his place...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will only end there.
I’m almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with the call of some asshole from the Kremlin wall.
I'm guessing who that might have been...
Cobson doesn’t have a lot to live on.
I don't understand why he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, put down a monument for him.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little homeland.
And reconciliation now only depends on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise 7th Leads the Ranking Despite Ninth’s Attempts to Enlighten the Loss of Leaders in Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to shed light on the consequences of the Liberal Party’s declaration of the leader’s release failed to raise the rating of Today.
In the morning, the show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
The competitor, Sunrise, with lead David Koch and Samantha Armitage, has been stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This far-reaching torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian television viewers, with the Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today gained a little more than its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has cut the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 at Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

An important news for the seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former star of the series Packed to the Rafters, Eric Thomson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has garnered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics debated whether Thompson could handle the popular show alone, without the star of the Rafters Rebecca Gibbs.
The result of yesterday's evening is a loud "yes" answer.
The X Factor 7 remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For Seven, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half-hours (from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new TV show, led by Andrew O'Keefe, brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) of the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hours of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hours – a staggering 720,000.
The hot seat was 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia’s ratings for the second night will force the Ninth to quietly admit that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellow, Sarah McKay, and Snowy Marcossky may have accidentally made it clear which of them would win in The Hollow.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in "The Hobbit", is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three who came to the final of the girl, of course, keep quiet about who exactly of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcos, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they might have given a sudden hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the very end, which will take place on Thursday
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values, vitality as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question “If not you, who should get the last Wood Rose?” they could involuntarily tell who of them actually won the heart of the “Church”.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoskie have undoubtedly called Mackay the perfect pair for Wood.
There has been a good relationship between Sarah and Sam since day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that,” said Jevons-Fellows.
“Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, there was a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay believes that she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it was definitely not just a game – I wholeheartedly believed him,” she says.
To the question of who should choose Wood, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor show will be released on Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jared Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his move to the U.S. — as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pawn in a winning game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Heine another opportunity to return the patch, and also engaged him in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed up on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of making a difference to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter for the 49ers club Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McCoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne lost the ball to the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter of the game.
This was the start of the NHL’s debut, Hayne and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect.
It was seen as Hayne roared away from the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more unsuccessful start to a career in the NFL.
“That’s what happens, you just think about the next game and everything,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when dropping the ball in his home zone brought Queensland an attempt.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
On the border of Hungary, there were clashes between migrants and police.
The refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which grew up in clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used watermelons and tear gas, according to Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to take down a fence on the border.
To the site of the clashes is a reinforcement, the police are taking measures in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reported.
The authorities of the country have allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, as well as the accelerated procedure for considering requests for asylum.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
Also, the Hungarian Parliament intends to consider in the near future the issue of the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces on the protection of the border of the country’s parliament.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175-km-long cable car fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian has admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
Indicted in the largest cyber attack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers.
During the trial at the federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the clash with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the defendants’ actions was estimated at $300 million.
“Respondents like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drunkman is facing 30 years in prison, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When the sentence is handed down, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and perhaps reduce his term.
Drinkman will be sentenced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is charged with.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia’s support of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks compounding and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our overall goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria,” he said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (whose activities are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed during the phone call that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians to master the technique to apply it against Islamists.
Four people were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before launching rubber bullets into action.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last of several weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where representatives of the Madez people say that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the citizens of Taru, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, ranging from 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it became a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The lawmakers voted in favour of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise in 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
Built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, it has an advanced infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of the "Regional".
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of the local budget.
A municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document turnover to five days.
Previously, the papers on the courts could go for months.
Measures have been developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a government meeting was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no design and accounting documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewerage collector and plumbing.
Road works are already being carried out in two areas.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
No such positive demographics have been observed in the city in the last 27 years.
So the issue of the security of places in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
From 1 September closed for the capital renovation of the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, a kindergarten No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children, opened.
The repair was made under conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been found, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half to three years.
We don’t have children between the ages of three and seven.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be done, first of all, the Sayan enterprises, which are the ones that need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningrad micro-region is put into operation.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which entered the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing for those wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles for one square meter, this price includes the decoration "under the key".
If we manage the specified amounts, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for the investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Saian pork complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for priceless.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to protest this deal.
Even more so, the land under the facility is federally owned.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional property is decided, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a big support for the city.
Has the Institute of Social Partnership been developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 agreements of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Sensitive support is provided by enterprises such as JSC "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya TEC, LLC "Sayansky Broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city of OOO "Sayansky Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Centre" carried out a repair of the horse yard, where specialists deal with children with hypothermia, spending more than 1 million rubles on it.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to renovate the territory of the city of ZAGS.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city day in a colorful way.
As in the old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
A chronicle of the city was published, a book of Sayan poets.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk have been awarded the anniversary medals.
The patrons are also involved in the work of the City Charitable Fund.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles is aimed at supporting talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from underprivileged families.
How do you solve staff problems in the social sphere in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
To solve the personnel issue, the provision of housing specialists is of great importance.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have received official housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
In the plans - replanning of the building, in which will be built another eight apartments for teachers.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program “Accommodation for the Russian Family”.
In the future - the construction of a house for workers of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential for Sayansk and our region is great.
A draft law on indexation of social pensions was introduced in the Duma, taking into account the increase in prices.
A bill was introduced in the State Duma, which provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Just Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Romantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rates of the pensioner’s living minimum in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions taking into account the growth rates of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE told Mogherini that sanctions against parliamentarians would not be allowed.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the Assembly’s activities are not acceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator Nikolai Kovalev.
In support of Canerva’s position, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, were collected.
"There has already been a fairly strong support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting signatures of deputies who indicated the impermissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the problem to the level of the EU's governing bodies and "send the relevant petition".
NHC reports that the likelihood of cyclone south of the Green Mass islands is 60 percent
A wide front of a low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Mass Islands is likely to turn 60 percent into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined area of low pressure roughly in the middle between the Green Mass Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, say the Mayan synoptics.
Google is launching a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a campaign to double donations designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help displaced European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-characteristic personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations in its blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Massoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We arrived on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, so many people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the wars that have been fought in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may be able to help weight loss surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity who suffer from type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that low-fat diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“Death statistics don’t show up immediately,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at a value from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or higher indicates that a person has excess weight, and people with IMT over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – gastric shunt and hand gastrectomy, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average IMT value among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT in those who received non-surgical treatment from diabetes remains at approximately level 29.
Among those who underwent the surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and in part - 28%.
In the group receiving drug treatment, for comparison, complete treatment from diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “in general were better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also controlled hemoglobin levels of A1s in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best rates of glycemic control reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce the death rate in five years, according to research lead Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the arm gastrectomy group, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 % versus 2.1%), and was also closer to full-fat divisibility (16.1% versus 2.1%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of lifespan after five years, there is evidence from the study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment really leads to an increase in lifespan, according to Ulysses.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to a group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in lifespan, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI falls in the range of 27 to 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to turn it back.
In Mytishchy, the robbers took out the coat and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchy, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns through the open door entered the house, located on Gorky street, tied the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under the article "Breaking".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not yet in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to move all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt’s interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for the rental housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically under priority, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents at the request of the Federal Antimonopoly Service on St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing some number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on the account of literally every number, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all the St. Petersburg hotels.
Tourists can now count on 30.5 thousand rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star hotels, 550 - one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy of the tourism development committee of Nana Gwichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have been classified - so many checks have been carried out by the accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny is not known for the surprising accumulation of circumstances.
That is, there may be more than the previous classification, but no one knows about it.
"For the past six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification," said Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which the hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, in which the costs for checks were not imposed, while the procedure can be carried out by the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
Recently, however, hotel managers have stepped up and started to submit applications for classification, Shadskaya assured.
The hotels have to be successful until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but also will not get the right to work in the world championship.
It is already known that depending on the star rating will be developed a fixed fee for the number in the hotel at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order not to allow prices to rise by 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to be conscious and not allow the increase to two or three times, but you also need to let the hotels make a profit.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” – explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how much this is within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better to travel unhindered,” he said.
It is not clear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma introduced a bill, according to which hostels should be banned in residential homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not affect St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Guwahati said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels should in any case be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and at the moment they have 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to Leonid Garbar, president of the North-West Federation of Restaurateurs and Hotellers, there are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are also in demand by football fans, so there is a switch to hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation where “75,000 VIPs sit in the 80,000 stadium”.
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban to be “idiotism”: “It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but here the newcomers can’t for some reason.”
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel guests come to for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing out on the World Cup and because of their irredeemability.
Hundreds of small hotels simply will not manage to pass the classification, and the pit will rot itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order works.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, punctuated figures.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is due, among other things, to the permanent relocations in the government's tourist block, which does not contribute to the coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
On the occasion of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will come prepared on vans, in which you can spend the night.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will then be empty,” says Gennady Lamshin.
Also, great popularity during the football championship will be enjoyed by the removable housing.
Most likely, in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first will leave the housing near the stadium," said a specialist on the rental of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research Larisa Bragin.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport lines on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
It is also worth noting the human qualities of the people.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, in which people not only point the way, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother and two children in the yard.
They were nowhere to sleep: it was difficult with hotels then, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added, that now there is no such feature in the inhabitants of the city - calling home is fraught with consequences and terrible.
But perhaps in 2018 after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the former?
Zhirinovsky "flooded" the Amur region.
With admiration today he looked at Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and still is in great shape.
The theme of the speech, apparently, is “a protest by the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; there are no other protocols except those signed by the constituents, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he takes the second place of Ivan Abramov and yells something like, "Here is the winner of the election!"
And right away, he throws himself on Rodnin, and then, after a confrontation with the president, he leads a faction out of the meeting room, chanting literally, "You're all with the fronts of your guts and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Indeed, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is the next outing of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Podonka!", and not at all a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
Both the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, if the party’s website and Facebook Ivan Abramov are believed, are not recognized, but the leader of the issue is apparently down.
It allows the dead on Amur itself to bury their dead, and it himself preaches against “United Russia” in general and in no way to blame Rodnina.
An elegant solution, so that neither the face is lost, and in a real, not a spectacular scandal not to go.
Another thing that now turns out to be in a strange position is the Abrams themselves.
He did not expect anything from the leadership, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for a narrow circle it is he who has become a formal reason to insult the respected champion, and, even worse, the Ham cases to the ER and the ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, it can turn into a pair that successfully used its own party leadership and super-enthusiast for the same ONF and party leadership.
There would have been no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respected to watch him.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
I mean, the bathroom didn't fall off at all.
Only, the subject of Abramov was buried under him.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, dedicated to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this is a source of admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has spoken out highly about Germany and Austria's actions in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you should also think about long-term decisions on how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the terrorist acts of 9/11, saying that the U.S.’s harsh reaction launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase, as of 2010, the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested a hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of swallowing children up to 12 years of age for hand disinfection reported in toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are in contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, some percent of them are sent to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
You can see on YouTube videos how teenagers drink disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink. . . .
It is reported that adolescents mixed disinfectant liquid with alcohol-containing liquid to rinse the mouth to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of the disinfectant liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it can hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting fluids for the hands) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfecting liquids for hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The disinfectant liquid for the hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration spirit,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just leave a rum out of whiskey, but people keep in mind these hand sanitizers, and if children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a large amount of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested a hand sanitizer with a clumsy aroma in the amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment in the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be in an alcoholic state, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was delivered to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night at a separate children’s clinic to avoid missing any signs of a brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Orthia Scott, Naiji’s mother, told CNN.
This could have been fatal for my child.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectants, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for hands from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic, undisclosed ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a lethal agent, not an ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as the active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York agreed to poison their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty talks" and addresses issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
At the back of the drawer at the entrance to the N.K. Krupskaya Children's Library, a cast owl is crushed.
The kids who come after the books are trying to feed her with candy.
It has been in this library for 95 years for several generations.
The very first readers in the 1920s arranged loud readings here, put performances on Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary quizzes and rewritten with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote in 1939, with each day "the friendship between the Hope of Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
The hope of Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaulian friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if he did not object to the hope of Constantine to assign her name to the library, she wrote that he did not, he did not object.
The letters have long been in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain which rough profile is decorated with a baleleph on the building of the library.
During the years of reconstruction, different people often called, angry: why isn’t the children’s library renamed?
Let there be a library of names of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The staff of the library settled, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as a "line" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path made of yellow brick.
"The Magician of the Immortal City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskowka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all the other managers was distinguished only by a love of drawing.
And then she found an ad on the Internet: "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mother's Cancer".
Ola made illustrations and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn’t create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers from all over the world, and makes up stories herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But there are reading children coming to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading,” says Tatiana Kushvid, director of the library.
In recent years, we’ve even had such a moment of confidence that a children’s library is needed, and it will live – kids come here!
I think the interest in reading is back.
In the vestibule of the library hangs a large exhibition window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once in the neighborhood, new photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family are hung up in the neighborhood: mom, dad and children.
The library is pleased that more and more parents have come with the children.
If at two years old the child was read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-old Wonderkind from publishing books of category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of diapers with diapers and eras, to guide Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, "explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint together.
We have made a playground for children - the child just comes to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers take their parents, and they stick to their feet, don’t want to leave.
Moms often come with strollers – and we’re glad that they put the library first among all the other places to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children, just like we used to, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is now developing, and a lot of attention is given to authors who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to small children, it’s important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes books for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books should be paid attention and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden to bring books outside the reading room to adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the library.
The steps will scream under your steps - it's already a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book like an old friend: hello, it’s good that you and I don’t change.
Elli is still walking along the road with a yellow brick, the tapes of Tola Ryzhikov steal magic spears, and Malchish-Kibalch has never said a word to the bloody bourgeois of the Military Secret.
Such books are like passwords, on them you can find your own anywhere.
There are in storage and real book rarities - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of buffalo with hedgehogs and herons.
Or lead Korolenko in the famous app to the magazine "Niva".
Or the "Murzilka" lining for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, decorated them in a tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the pieces of our future collection, I've always dreamed of going to retirement and dealing with rare children's books.
But the kids won't do that, so to speak: and the colors in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the commodore.
Now it seems: why did we all write this “Pioneer Truth?”
But it was still interesting, - says the "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasov, head of the bookstore.
The pages of the Murzilki have been obscured from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running the bookstore her whole life.
She knows the color of Buratino's hat, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the silencer for the motorist, and who works for Alice Selezneva's father.
Librarians pay little for their work, and anyone who can live without these lines of books finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: the Enlighteners, the educators, the servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be learned with a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of the children's librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation - it's a professional.
I love children’s books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be just and beautiful on the shelves, and I also love to read them,” says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I'm reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me back then.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be there, despite the riders.
And I'm glad that our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Hearing Grinder: There are no disagreements in "Celtic"
Griffiths denied talks about disagreements in the Celtics after admitting to Dale that the Hops were in a bad position, but he would fix it.
The Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association’s claim to Nelson, and Warren is afraid to sign contracts in January that could violate the unity of the team.
"Dons" increased advantage over "Celtic" to five points
Adam Runy's penalties in the first half gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths has denied talks about the differences.
This prompted rumors of disagreements in the Celtics, which were interrupted by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering any heightened criticism, preparing for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we’re feeling tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Bur
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Burr said Dutch football fans had lost interest in the Celtics as he did not compete for the Rangers title.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "In Holland, the most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Company games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
Defeated by Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and, as a result, exiting the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 players of Aberdeen, who now, breaking down by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Delilah said, “Celebration has had bad periods before, and we’ll be out again.”
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Seltika’s support, because that’s what makes the players so much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warburton is looking forward to the January transfer.
Despite opinions appearing just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warberton is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Seltik, hinted at the end of his career
Assaulting "Sunshine" Micha, linked to "Celtic" during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with "Sleeps" ended.
The 29-year-old suffered from knee problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts" are going to oppose the SFA over Neilson's statements
"Harts" led with a 2:1 bill when they removed Paterson and started losing 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; it was Collum's third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on his words, saying, "I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid the Tyncasl.
The stubborn player of the Hypernian team received a sentence after admitting to singing the song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Sc<0xC3><0xA1>tzel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was burning," the striker said, adding: "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to return to Tyncattle unless he plays for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of Dandy United is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys to go out again," Donnelly said.
McKinness is happy that "unbelievable" won at Hamilton
Derek McKinness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assisi to achieve a seventh consecutive win in the league championship, putting them five points above Celtic, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runey's penalty shootout.
McInness said, “There’s no team here that would win anything — a cup, or a league championship that didn’t win meetings that way.”
The level of unemployment among the Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 for the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than in the United Kingdom at 5.5%, as shown by figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, while the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped by a quarter to 74.0% – higher than the average figure of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scotland’s Minister of Affairs David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market in Scotland as employment grows and unemployment decreases.
Why I'm a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal interference at a late stage, I will watch as a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a death row gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique course.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of places for the press has decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he would look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we have had our own relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of committing my selfless act of self-sacrifice.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself “could have formulated it better,” but still believes that I’m wrong about what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that, even if he did.
I told him he could take me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after Barry van Treese's murder make him guilty of assisting the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure that the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this course, I'll see how he dies.
I cannot say that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can talk to you about it.
From me you will know what it is like to watch the person I like die without necessity.
The man who was being chased by police was ordered to leave the Canning River.
Constable from the town of Canning-Wales managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and to remain dry.
The resident of Perth was about to leave the police, but was unable to, stuck in dirty water on the waterfront a few meters away from the police officer, trying to "slowly persuade him to go to the shore".
Kanning-Weyla police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into someone else's territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself at Kanning.
But he didn't go far.
“He was standing in the water and said, ‘I’m not going out, come on, grab me,’” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Kaslday.
Constable Laklan Perhavets was not very keen to urinate the form, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good police officer".
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Senior Sergeant Caslday.
That’s exactly what football champion Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazinz went to the quay to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be futile, but prompted locals to invent the funny "Ben Kazin's biathlon".
Peter Moody Accuses Stewards of Spying and Threatens to Leave Horse Sports
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy on his horse last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His goal was to become the stewards and staff of the Racing Victoria ethics department, whom he accused of organizing a campaign personally against him, and the dismissal of Lady Tatai's start-up due to a violation of the rules of drug use on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the jumps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of Lidari’s cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He held his tongue about suspected espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been waiting a long time, but sometimes it gets you out of the wheel so much that you don't hold back," Mudi said.
They know it has continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to live through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with a high head and I want my owners to know – I do everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's wrong, then I'm going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
In an interview on racing.com, Mudi said that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man I would call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable,” Moody told Racing.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, they should all, of course, make statements, because the attempt to catch me failed them.
Robert Rollston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moody, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Sondry, current CEO of the RVL, knew about it all the time and now know it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's going to be personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to take responsibility for what’s going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and I'm sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put responsibility on them for making a decision.
I have support from the family, and I can leave.
The coach’s boredom only grew during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last horse removal from the start forced him to declare that he could “turn his license to the table.”
Mudi, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "funny" after the horse was pressed on the legs of the clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on the jumps.
“I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compress on her leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for the use of compression, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all know we need rules, but it has gone too far,” Mudi said.
The driver who made the trip and hid from the scene of the incident in Cobra was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken on a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, the 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and in violation of other rules of road traffic.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobra, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Melburn Storm coach Craig Bellamy pairs accusations against rivals in the use of harsh force-based tactics
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball a "fixing of the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Sydney Ruthers coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during a sudden Storm victory in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Coach Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear bet with Storm after his team won the finals of a qualifying tournament at the Laker Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called this game a "typical" match for the Kwoks League, and a statement
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball with his team and stated that they were simply focused on "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was instilled in him the confidence of his team's critics by the two leading coaches, as this means that they are worried about a possible defeat from the Storm.
“It keeps popping — I haven’t heard Trent Robinson talk about tough receptions when they beat us at 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for a whole year, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s obviously training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and for him it’s been a bit of a shock.
It’s fun, as it always seems at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized a lot by calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care much about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young half-backs with their speed.
This is the football you would like to play in when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his own style – not every team has two half-backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game Storm and Rusters was a competition with more points than the game Broncos and Cowboys.
The game "Broncos" was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is that impressive football?
Or to consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storms at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Kronalla Sharks the following Saturday evening at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale the next morning.
The accused in the storage of drugs Serbs are released on bail in the amount of 200 thousand dollars
The man, who is threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to give 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by a smuggler, was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which ran from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his associates were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is in danger of a lifespan for trying to allocate drugs in the amount sufficient for sale, the lawyer Maximovich claims that the evidence that the latter tried to get the whole party is absent, and that the man was no good at it.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, doubted that Maximovich was worth bailing out.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and father of Maximovich was asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“From the evidence of both, it becomes clear that the amount of the $200,000 bet is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But one such measure is not enough as a guarantee that it will not go away, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released on bail on condition that he will hand over both his Australian and Serbian passport, will be taken to the police daily and will observe the command hour from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsicaris: “I’m proud of the Greek team that fought until the last seconds.”
Greece's head coach Fotis Katsicaris paid tribute to his team after a 1/4 final match of EuroBasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was solved by certain mistakes.
It was a big game, - quoted by AFP Katsicaris.
We were preparing for a great game in the performance of the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but the mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It’s sad, but I’m proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: “At CSKA I will be assigned the functions of the Crown.”
CSKA news anchor Joel Freeland said he did not believe in the curse of the armies.
The Britishman also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I've been talking to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer, and after I joined the team, I've been told by myself that I'm going to be assigned the role of Sasha Kaun, who left the team as a defensive midfielder.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to regroup to the center position, but still in the NBA I've played the forward more.
Now I will have to face a bigger central rival, but I’ve done this before, so I think I’ll do it now.
The last time the army won the EuroLeague was in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but there each time they could not show their best basketball.
There is a feeling that someone has looked at the team.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we are going to show the best we can, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I have always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match with Roma will be special.”
The head coach of Barcelona, Louis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the Champions League group tournament with "Rome" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the obvious combination of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Louis Enrique trained “wolf” in the 2011/12 season, but was unable to show himself on the best side in the capital of Italy.
“I came back to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience,” said Luis Enrique, UEFA’s official website.
With Rome, I have a very warm memory.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League from victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from the Rome game that she showed in the A series against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has different options of attacking actions".
The acting head coach of Ural Vadim Skripchenko, ahead of the 9th round of the Premier League match with Krasnodar, noted the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "bukes" have in their arsenal several models of the game in attack.
The match will take place on September 21 and will begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
How to play with "Krasnodar", let's see, - says the official website "Ural" of the word Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options of attacking actions, conducts their attacks in a variety of ways, and at the same time we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the Europa League match against Dortmund's "Borussia", we will try very well to prepare to win.
Rocher Canyas: “Astana’s House Can Pick Anyone’s Glasses”
Astana midfielder Rocher Kanjas after the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Hawbek, in their field Astanas are able to pick points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - says the official UEFA website Kanyasa. - We were a little short of courage in the attack.
"Benfica" is higher than the class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick points.
That's real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
In home games, we can pick up points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I repeat as many times as I can: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a big win in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with Shakhter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Christian Ronaldo, who became the author of three heads.
"The match was difficult because Shakhtar is capable of possession of the ball," Benitez said on UEFA's official website.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always in danger.
“I’m not saying that Real has played perfectly, but we had enough of the goals.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level of success.
He's the best player in the world, I'll repeat that as many times as I can.
Jordi Alba: “Christian Ronaldo cannot be compared to Messi.”
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one will be able to compare with his clubmate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, the forward of the Real Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
Messi on five heads above the rest, Le Figaro Albu quotes. - What Leo is capable of, no one can.
Even Christian Ronald's.
Leo on the field is changing, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: “Barcelona” has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Half-back "Rome" Daniel De Rossi on the eve of the match of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Barcelona" noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
We will remind you that the "SE" will carry out its text transmission.
“Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players,” UEFA’s De Rossi said on its website.
It is difficult to play with blue-granates, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To leave them, we'll have to smell throughout the match and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wrapping, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
Ezhov hopes to come out in the starting line-up of the SKA in a match with "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yejov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting line-up of the armies in the next match of the KHL championship.
Ezhov went on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute at a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his goals, the fourth goal of the SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next match the team will conduct on their way out against the Slavs.
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up, "R-Sport" says Ezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we don't show repeated missed goals, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used a girl’s phone to get paedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with the online messaging service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, after which she immediately turned her mother’s attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, then investigated the computers found at the address, and found “relevant” requests in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done so because it could "attractive the paedophiles", and then he would " pretend that he is a policeman to scare them."
Elid Robertson, a court-appointed executive, told the Dandy Sheriff’s Court: “He said it was a passion, he was passionate about scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures, and about the fact that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw indecent images on the phone, and then an eye-witness bet was made with the accused.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused had used a computer and a "PlayStation" to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, found himself guilty of being charged with making indecent pictures of children on June 14 of last year, violating the terms of the bail on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for hearing on March 24 of this year.
The defendant’s lawyer Gregor Sim appealed not to include Hogg in the list of persons who committed sexual crimes, as it can be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, before receiving social services reports.
Hogg was released on bail on this case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on other remaining cases began.
It was included in the list of persons who committed crimes of a sexual nature before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe does not read the speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest state leader, fell off the stairs leading off the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the falling scene instantly spread on social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats, warning them of Mugabe's ouster at the time of the appeal.
A month ago, they bribed the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was this speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innosent Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled ‘Death’,” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the distinguished members of Parliament that the inviolability ends in the building of the Parliament, and once they leave, the parliamentary inviolability does not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tswangirai, was "concerned" by the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its Restructuring and Cost Reduction programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be split into two companies registered on the company's stock exchange, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing sectors of hardware and service operations.
Calculations as a result of the projected job cuts will amount to about $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business direction portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help move the company to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than US$50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hullett and Dave Pacard, split up to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large-scale reorganization with the aim of transitioning from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the U.S., is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Arsenal captain Michael Arteta says his teammates should support traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that provided that if Wilshire’s recovery goes according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game at Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will certainly miss at least four of the following games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The saddest thing about this recent issue is that Wilshire had surely finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: “This injury doesn’t threaten his career.”
It's just not a dead bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This has nothing to do with the boots or the injuries that he has suffered before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries associated with this for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries that happened to him over the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, at the expense of which the most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the likelihood of a concussion in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the final season will continue.
"Sometimes, getting back in shape after the injury, you're vulnerable for a while - during this time you need to restore strength and gain a competitive edge," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I’m sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and continue on Saturday games with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to hold a rotation of the team.
Ektor Beljerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting line-up will play Mate DeBush and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an absolute favourite in Group F, the stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is one of the most exhausting in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend the previous season as the Undefeated.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have mastered the lesson learned last season when the team suffered defeat in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions League final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I’m a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is eye-opening, especially given how desperate the need for men to be frank has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it occurs three times more often with men than with women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of the “Campaign Against Unfortunate Life” announced 2015 as the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large enough number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of treatment are doubled.
Equally, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship works, first of all, that it should be.
In an age when communications are managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to look strong, loving, and successful, even if in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of the video game, recently noticed, for the money, do not buy more happiness at all.
The dignity of friends is that they attract this attention.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that appeared in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’s excitement over Rachel’s — all stems from an understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As an employee of Samaritans told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, underscores how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strong, as well as the feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-running coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a foreign person talking on the phone helps people in times of despair, while the long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday you have completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better – if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say “Hi.”
Don’t assume in advance what benefits friendship can bring.

Di Maria hits a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel di Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a, along with Blaze Matyuydi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the ball in the Malm<0xC3><0xB6> gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily bypass Malm<0xC3><0xB6> on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the Park de Press Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player to set the course for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhter in Group A, Pari had to start off well in the game against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not to qualify for the playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the finish line.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Loran Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him on the pitch in the game against the team from his hometown and the club in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy - to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2:0, to deliver problems to rivals and to play well in defense - it's a good start, even if there are still points that we'll need to finish during the season," said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her a 2–2 draw in a match with Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but was pushed back to the back of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player able to take the PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought out of Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran for a pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmo, Davos and Cra.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and big victory from PSG then, they had to be disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, had nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the knock of Nikolay Djurji<0xC4><0x8D>, in which the ball flew past the long bar of Kevin Trapp's gate in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
However, the PSG has sometimes subjected itself to ineffectual transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who only in the first half was unable to make at least five attempts, and then was unable to process the ball that Kavani struck immediately after the game resumed.
However, he proved to be much more skilled in precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, having received which, Di Maria sent the ball in a twisted blow, which passed by a touchdown to the pole past Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the clock ticking thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic adjusted the ball sent to the centre of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malm<0xC3><0xB6> had regarding returning to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Willand from a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before Ezekiel Lavessi's replacement did not count.
Malme coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory "Money"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion to Sell Shares
Switzerland-based mining and trading giant Glencore, which has suffered from falling commodity prices, has earned $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its massive debt-reduction plan.
The company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, has made a statement that it has sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion in order to repay the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is trying to cope with a collapse in commodity prices while China’s downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in world markets.
Thanks to the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore’s stock price on the London Stock Exchange rose at early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of extensive plans to cut its 30-billion-dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares of 125 cents per item, i.e. a 2.4 percent discount on the price when trading closed on Tuesday.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company’s authorized capital.
Due to concerns about the continuation of the decline in the Chinese economy, the cost of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell in price by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit — Xi Jinping’s first visit to Washington — will take place on September 25 and will be a response visit to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife Pen Liyuan at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the U.S. and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow U.S. and Chinese presidents to approach the issues in question constructively,” the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was announced for the first time in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading U.S. technology companies on their way to Washington, D.C., and then head to New York to attend the September General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and China’s rise in categoricality over the South China’s disputed watershed.

During the debate, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years in prison and recover from him the claims of the victims in full – eight million rubles.
The accident, which we are talking about, occurred on May 22 at about three o’clock in the night in the area of house 30 on Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW car, behind which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the meeting lane and hit the motorcyclist standing on the side.
The man who was injured in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and went to the meeting line before the DTP.
Fearing that the driver will try to get away from the responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Vorobyev mountains to the Moscow FUMVD building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation resulted in a delay in the alleged culprit of the TIR.
In Moscow, a naked man was detained in the temple.
He acted calmly and did not commit any illegal acts, the police handed him to the doctors for urgent psychiatric assistance.
The city police arrested a resident of Moscow, who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
According to Andrey Galiakberov, head of the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Moscow, the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, at about 4 p.m., on the Kashirsky highway.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He acted calmly and did not commit any unlawful acts.
A police uniform arrived at the scene on the call.
The law enforcement officers were waiting for the doctors from the emergency psychiatric aid brigade and handed them the man.
He was a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakusev at the meeting of the Presidium of the regional government.
Some of them dealt with the allocation of funds to educational and medical institutions in municipal education in the area.
In particular, funds are directed for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of Nizhnetavdin district, for the capital repair of the regional hospital in Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
Repairs of hot and cold water supply networks, water supply, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be carried out, will bring the facade of the building in order, will repair the premises, will carry out a complex of activities on fire safety and energy conservation.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, which will be attended by the Tumen delegation headed by the governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation is told by the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugla, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is built on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links of relations between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, about the legislation and programs of the Federal State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I believe that this is evidence of the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of profile ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates participated in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work also speaks to the fact that in Tyumen there was a meeting of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in the preparation of personnel for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakusev talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be touched - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshin" and options for prevention of losses were discussed.
Issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC "MAZ", development of service center of JSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC "TPATP".
The discussion also touched on the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to go to a new level.
These questions were also addressed by the regional centre.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moor we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the ladan", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: The Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lifting products of JSC Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for installing new elevators in the district center.
I would add that, within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing the turnover of goods and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zauraly was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is planned at the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a hub for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow to solve many problems directly and quickly, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the plant, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is opposed to focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that there is no need to take ethnic composition into account.
During the Sunday release of the show Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the chosen script for the project.
“The variety is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Scared Brown, not believing his ears, insultedly shouted "Ogo! Nothing to himself. Well, all the while the actor from "Marsianina" gave comments on the live show.
To discuss the finalists of the show, co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers joined Damon and Brown.
"I'd like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretations of the Harmony image they're going to stick to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white suitor.
The producer of the film Dear White People advocated for the film to be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end we can get not what we want".
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproval comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video shown: “The explanation of the essence of the diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room SO WHITE that is painful.”
Twitter has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s remarks come just when the literal coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most acute question on the agenda of public discussion.
After a 2014 teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like the books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a Fox News employee’s question about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnates invited with a visit to Pope Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" wins first champion
Professional rocker and waitress assistant Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the "American Ninja Warrior" show, taking home a prize of $1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to pass all the stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two participants - Caldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot-long rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and settled on a set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior", the last boring stage 4, but Caldiero managed the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the victory, delivered with incredible hard work, Caldiero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
“To think about it is incredible, I’ve never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E!’s reporters in a statement.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it was... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wied met with reporters at The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who first passed the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
“If the finished players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them,” Wid said.
Although money is a great reward and life-changing, it still gets huge satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended about that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He has received tons of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, “If I was destined to lose someone, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
"Detroit Tigers" quietly bypassing "Minnesota Twins"
Minneapolis - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now taking last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending only to be an obstacle, the Tigers brilliantly won Tuesday at the Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 result at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut half-games back from the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away from them most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they get,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Peter "Taigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another in sixth and one in ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine outs.
“I just want to finish a year with good grades,” Simon said.
Pitchers don’t get to throw in every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The Tigers-backed Viktor Martines managed to score three hits and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since four strokes in the game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (better quality), noticeably better in the work of the beat and retained this quality for the game.
After getting three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
Central receptionist Byron Baxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bantam, took the first base, and second bassman Brian Dozer got a strike-out on the interception from Simon before his place was taken by leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moera, the only player on the way, previously a newly appointed hitter, Miguel Sano, who beat a two-run "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of wounds not in the car and a comparative wound on the second base Verhagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to a rebound in the double play.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season when Pluff beat the ball in a double play.
After Detroit added a sub-inning injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moore earned RBI a "double" in the space between outfielders against Bruce Rondon's closing Tigers pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth savvy.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practicing Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the injured list prior to the game, missing more than a month due to a backburner.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to do some pretty good third innings."
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second bassman Ian Kinsler.
Wook, on the two cars of Wrightfielder J.D. Martinez, took Victor Martinez out, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martines finished his series "0 per 21" with the ranchers in an effective position.
Third-base player Nick Castellanos then made a single, another wound was brought, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a one-out double from James McCann's catheter and a two-out single from centre-back Anthony Goose, and the score was 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right to the right point.
Hughes, whose castings were considered, threw in the unearned points of the third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-hander A.J. Ahter.
Hughes had three wounds on six hits and a four strike-out joke.
ATTENTION: The right-hand pitcher of the Tigers, Anibal S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, left the players due to a right shoulder extension.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had a shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
For S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, the launch is scheduled for Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and come out against the Twins.
Norris, who has been out with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-back pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He has not been in the game since August 20 due to muscle spasms.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov’s complaint about the book “Pray to God” was filed in the South Sakhalin court.
The South Sakhalin city court received the original of the appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov for the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Pray to God: its importance and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the president of the state.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the process.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the funds for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense themselves,” he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalya Perchenko’s decision to recognize the book as an “extremist material”.
The South Sakhalin Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they have asked the court to recognize only the opinion of the author of this book as extremists, and not as ayats from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chukhray said.
The decision to recognize the book as an “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, the "extremist" were called quotations from the Qur'an - "We worship you and ask you for help", "Do not call anyone along with Allah".
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "Satans and Provocateurs".
Members of the State Duma called for a legislative ban on court decisions concerning the texts of the sacred writings.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law, under which it is forbidden to take decisions in court relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that have been negatively impacted by migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
To fight xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook leadership is found in conjunction with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve of the head of the department, Haiko Maas said that at present, the mininost, together with social network specialists, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove any comments that are incorrect with respect to migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their records.
Encouraging the operational blocking of illegal content should also be the responsibility of organizations whose specialists are involved in collecting complaints from users of the social network for abusive posts.
Facebook’s management aims to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments on migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was made after the German Facebook segment had sharply increased xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis on its scale, which covered the countries of the European Union some time ago.
Thus, in Germany, all the points intended for the placement of refugees have already been filled.
On the eve of the authorities of the country decided to temporarily settle the migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be areas for relaxation in the Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first ones will be the Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekourov Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will appear in other parts of the city.
This portal m24.ru was told by Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State Budget Institution Ritual.
The relaxation zones will represent small green areas, reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners", visitors to the cemetery will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", in the event of the need to expand the areas of the cemetery, the builders will try to keep the existing forest massifs to the maximum extent possible.
The green plantations will serve as a living fence that will divide rest zones and areas taken directly under the places for burial.
Experts of the GBU Ritual also stated their intention to submit a proposal for the abandonment of fences at burials.
The new cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU Ritual told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with which visitors of the cemetery will be able to know GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, GBU Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of funeral services depending on the time of year.
So, digging the graves in the summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, the week of winter, when the land is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a missing mushroom was found in the forests of Elnin.
The old man turned out to be alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a provision.
The discovery of the mountain mushroom was made possible thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old retired from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought after by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even kinologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was connected to the search operation.
On that day, Vitaliy Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the forest behind the ponds and submersibles, but did not return to the evening.
The relatives immediately called for help, and the next day, rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were called in to search for the mushroom - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, the helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk region fire and rescue center, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went very far, quite elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search location.
He went a long way at his age.
The miracle is still alive.
The mushroom was brought to the central district hospital in Helsinki without consciousness, in a very difficult condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overcooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not represent at all.
Valentina Nep<0xC5><0xA1>a, head of the therapeutic department of the Central Bank of Elnin: "A patient examination, treatment is indicated."
Infusion therapy, anti-bacterial.
Considering all of his chronic illnesses.
The condition of the patient improved in the morning, it remains heavy, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says his grandfather used to collect mushrooms before, but he never went deep into the forest.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the mushroom found, shared: "The forest is near the road, in principle not local."
I have been visiting for a few years to visit my relatives.
Well, he went after mushrooms.
Apparently, he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In just the last few days, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, sticks and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that you can then go back.
The crash An-2 sat on average in the fraternal taiga.
On average, the An-2 crash site is located in Siberia.
The emergency landing of the plane of the Rosnoyarsk airline "Enisei" took place 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities and casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when landing.
An-2 made an official flight.
He had three crew members on board – a commander, a second pilot and an onboard mechanic, Interfax reports.
The accident plane made a flight on the route <0xC5><0xBD>eleznogorsk-Ilimsk - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The fraternal transport prosecutor after the crash landing of the An-2 began checking compliance with the flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned mysterious airfield in Koma.
Engines and on-board electronics were denied on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board the aircraft.
No one was injured in the emergency landing of the aircraft.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel Laureate: Globalization
To print out the processes of globalization had to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, the chief scientific officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the University of Applied Sciences, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
The trade borders between the two countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
“And these predictions have largely come true,” Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so cheerful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “poor” countries, which manifests itself in large income inequality, or more precisely, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by NIE WSE.
Together with the economist, Michael Kremer, professor at Harvard University, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalisation grows, according to the WSE.
There are specific processes taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, specialists D from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries are growing wages through cooperation with B-level workers from the rich, then D-level workers are not feeling or their wages are falling at all.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor who leads the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Athens.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution of the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, according to the scientist, the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and it is not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not in any case call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: the living connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the program of festive events - festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and fair in the style of the past, exhibition of Derbent carpets and Day of open temples, historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this is as if it came from the pages of "Thousands and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazarian Kaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the oriental plateaus, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Gema Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of living nature".
The shadow of the scatter crown saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitors of the mosque will pour fragrant tea and will be served with Dagestan delicacies - honey ginger, turmeric, mushy, miracle-sticks, iran and sweets.
In Derbent for centuries, great samovars have been used to drink tea to numerous guests at once.
The inscription on the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 years of Hijra.
In 733, according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior impresses with scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional attraction of the inhabitants of Derbent.
The owners of domestic birds put the blueberries in the yards, under the trees, on the shards.
An exciting sight - a flight into the sky of a room of white pigeons, similar to the flares of a festive fireworks display.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters in the sea, this building shut down the port of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of ancient Persidian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven back in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste - straws of wool, cotton or velvet of all colors and shades, with or without a fox, with a complex ornament and a strange fireplace.
The construction of the city began with magals - neighborhoods with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the mages have hardly changed.
Only the satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the pipeline, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, were preserved.
To this day, there are ancient sources, in which locals still collect water today.
Many Derbents prefer ordinary water from taps to water from proven historical fountains.
In Durban, there was one of the centers of racing crafts.
Watering and painting vases, dishes, baskets, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the racers and now make wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a stretched canvas, on which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship spans several centuries.
A new trend - among cannathodontists, more and more girls can be seen.
The museum "Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent" is now in the premises of the former Virgin Bath.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here accompanied by friends, and now anyone who wishes can see the vaulted dome hall, hot and cold pools, gone into the past belonging to swimming.
Most of Derbent's homes have hot water, but baths and steam baths are as popular today as they were in the old days.
About the benefit of warming the body by steam is written in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, muscles lose tiredness, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.

In Domodedovo there was a business “game at the airport”.
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried themselves in the role of airport staff.
For this purpose, models of three aircraft were installed in Domodedovo.
The young people not only watched and recorded the passengers, but also served the aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in the complexity it has not given up on reality.
Delayed flights, immediately two passengers with breaks on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport, it's hell.
For those who have settled in Domodedov’s hangar – a standard set of tasks that will be decided by beginners.
In one hangar, three major airports from different countries of the world were immediately accommodated.
Today there are four hundred students from the capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of aviation.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, turnover of luggage - they were even entrusted with buses on the airfield, traps and inspection of passengers.
Passengers are extremely problematic.
In one mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to understand all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the maintenance of the flight.
"For the failure to perform the relevant tasks, the fine is recovered from them," explains in an interview with the program "West-Moscow" financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.

After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
However, the evaluations for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
“I received them for having responded to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner,” said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game, a pear manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the Library of Foreign Literature of the U.S. Center.
The center has been working in Moscow for over 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently put into question the commitment of the Russian government to relations between the Russian and American peoples, which did not break even during the Cold War and other difficult moments of the long history of relations of our countries,” the statement said.
The American Center has created deep and strong connections between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place for numerous American prominent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the educational exchange program FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was soon to be put to trial.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
“We didn’t give you a 110-page order for you to be silent about it,” Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order to remove all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the turbulent economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides on the termination of the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: In less than 60 years since India’s declaration of independence for industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungles to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute problem is in large cities, where the development of infrastructure does not hasten for rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of enterprises and households, and few of the newly built houses are built.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, the environment minister called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “unfulfilled.”
Sometimes the court’s decision is really impossible to comply with the deadline set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, non-executable Dadlines also have a positive side: at least they make responsible people move.
“His main goal is to override this system,” adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled large structures: at its expense, the construction of the airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller structures was terminated.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagna, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said in a statement.
However, such explanations are far from always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to a single brush of a pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a squabble of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he asked the Delhi government for statistics on inbound and outbound road transport, as well as offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, knowing in advance at the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As the court’s attention began to be drawn to sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality, and even road accidents, popular anger began to subside a bit.
But the most painful theme of the principled judge was the Ganges River Cleanup Program, with the pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, sacred to the river Indians, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to screaming.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges into the statue of God, and there were fecal matter in it, the judge says.
You continue to pollute the river because you think: Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is a river that we worship and see what you do with it every day.
The Gang cleanup is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year from 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million indus swimming in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund to sell his costume, in which he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India will have to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unacceptable luxury,” said Malika Bhanot, an activist with the Gang’s Call.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between ecology and development.”

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the whole world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in a speech to a group tasked with leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Group’s Committee on Comprehensive Deepening Reforms.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, change of border control rules, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), attracting private capital, and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in the distribution of resources, ensuring business legitimacy and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it provides to companies, thereby ensuring that companies themselves will run their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of the state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for submitting applications for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Ketzen and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
