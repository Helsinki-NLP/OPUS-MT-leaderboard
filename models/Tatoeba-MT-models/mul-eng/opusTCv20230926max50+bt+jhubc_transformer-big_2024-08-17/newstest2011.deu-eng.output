What should they do, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new city councilors from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has a bit "turned off" by members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD council as they master the notorious snake that has become a citizen in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the fractious era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark regarding these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "patent word treasure".
But also Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use over and over again."
“I don’t like snakes much.”
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before the ODS election congress this year, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest Prague golf hole", "go to the confectionery", "Stienracks", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth – Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of Prague’s school – promised to participate in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth rider, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the front.
“I don’t care about these things and how the civil Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge.”
“For me, it’s important how we understand ourselves as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, in the headline mentioned above, allegedly did not recognize that Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek is the talk of the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor Bém.
The term "Oldmoor" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly came up with during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said, adding to the security, "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to prove a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> correctly as Tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even guesses where this figure is to be found and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
“I think that means going to some Prague catering business,” Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to solving the mystery, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s companies.
Consistent with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he is responsible for having created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than having this vocabulary of his own.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar civilised snake among the Social Democrats.
“I’ve asked my colleagues, too, but obviously there’s really no such thing with us.”
“We call ourselves by name, occasionally we also use abbreviations or nicknames,” says <0xC4><0x8C>SSD President Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - named “Hulda” by his party partners.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who paid attention to himself before the elections by machinations in party sponsorship, is taken by some colleagues "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Thus, top names are the only ones that the Social Democrats allow in the internal party language use.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like it when he is called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummikn<0xC3><0xBC>ppel-Rights" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women remain spared this as they help with work and give birth to children," a sister of the Order describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than a hundred women who have been evicted from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to prevent the "hexen-tracking".
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” the newspaper “the standard” pointed to the dilemma of written education.
However, the practice of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and simply set them on fire.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would have been only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is flammable, which is used for ritual ointments.
And that is, after the group tried to "throw an evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
The standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “Freezing human souls is a danger earlier than today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president has in the past year properly mixed up the president himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh conceived a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
“To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea for help, who forcibly abducted women and men detained indiscriminately with police, soldiers and the president’s bodyguard from Gambian villages and brought them to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the crumpled people were forced to drink an abscess from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He is heating in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon bar" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been increased in the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is due to rent a 2-room apartment next year with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove," he taps angry with his finger on the son's new lease, to which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explained half-confused and half resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to simply sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they remember to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just swings away.
“One says this, the other says that,” he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-based rent.
Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" in person.
The RPG room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device.
"Rental 2011", so a special keypad lights up on the touch screen.
Briefly typed and the device already pops out a number list.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already peeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
As of mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the new leases will flatter most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer center has been open since November 18.
“The action is going on for a little over a week, that is, that’s just the beginning,” the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation as the “client” unravels as a journalist.
The deregulation and baccalaureate of former miners’ apartments are a brisk subject.
Before the elections, parliamentary vice-president Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD had taken up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Don't even think about it. Toilet glasses were able to replace them," the man mentioned at the time airs.
So far, the employees are primarily on the switch to convince themselves that they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease until December 15 are also expected to enjoy a half-reduced February rental.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded with demand.
“Of the 360 customers who were there yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were due to this,” the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites as well as wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach,” RPG said in a statement on its website.
“Nobody goes to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially the right.
“I have 13,000 (krone) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"See you soon."
“Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting,” she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent level is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the hired tenants is the main reason for the homeowners' opinion.
While RPGs were able to invest four billion from the rents received between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few bright red information appear in the meantime.
“The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the homes of RPGs.”
“Always this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month,” is read on the LCD monitor.
In just 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, rent increases by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter,” argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not propel the rents up jumpy, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What’s more – the company is committed to another commitment: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in thermal savings – in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-children's garden here, with everything that comes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game on the outdoor terrace.
This Kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of famous Br<0xC3><0xBC>nner buildings come from, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company-minikindergarten.
Wisely anticipated, because most of its 90 employees (within) are in the babyboom age and the company is located in that the project brides and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working shortened, the Kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The construction engineers and architects have made it so much easier to bring their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational kindergarten is funded by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After exhausting the funds (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
The children are cared for by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but several children change each other over the day.
The Kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the Kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini Kindergarten is still comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, they are mainly offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, in addition they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten is eliminated.
Therefore, parents use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships also develop here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer clear benefits when applying for new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are cracked fishmowers.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the art style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and creatures.
It is only with a more precise view that it is noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors even more.
The same swinging lines and swirling shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, and even gables and railings.
The house Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia shopping street No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which was carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally consisted of the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> rental house was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Precisely on its drawing board the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists were also involved in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> house in Park G<0xC3><0xBC>ell, which also houses further works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms due to the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "walking house".
It is also said that at the very top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other pictorial elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces for the house.
Something bizarre is already motivating its 45-degree inclination.
In his creation, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was not in any way affected by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so appalled at the completion of the result that they demanded help.
Among other things, the councilors were also faced with the fact that the construction with its pillars even interfered with the public civil ladder.
However, no further changes were made, quite the contrary - just fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted a request for the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social lounge, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs one step up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, so that a larger society could speak comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors thanks to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s conversion in addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
Impressive is Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is clad and the light courtyards.
The play of these two colors gives a maximum amount of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house decided only in the year on this step, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly affordable business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were extended to other common and the attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a cardboard style, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist visas receive a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the homeowners and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattresses and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are much heavier than ordinary polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
After all, if they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is present: it is not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Although all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their detachable shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
“I also recommend these to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the ‘information’ from the joints and skin poorly,” explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I took care of many ice hockey players years ago, as well as other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it bends straight to the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubit (wandbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the soles should still be calculated to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are 180 cm tall need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm wide, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
The comfort for and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the gymnast of the upholstery and room equipment, who has been devoting herself to the problem of healthy sleep and ergono for years.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to mount the grid at different heights and this is no longer possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be missing on the form layer and the fine pad.
“You can’t feel the feathers with your hand or when you put them on,” warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like co-grown Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and congested sieve).
That’s also why experts reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has its when and yet.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress saver, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even if today, as a rule, mattress covers are made with a round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (imminently important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often has to be carried out, like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
For non-adjustable lattice grids with 14 to 18 spring strips (lames) are suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (if applicable also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for grids with a larger number of lattice, i.e. of 28 or more spring strips, with Lordos support in the lumbar vertebral area, and the possibility of regulating the lattice and lattice.
Adjustable slats do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they allow for the punctual lowering of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
It is also intended for the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitortion spring are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, thereby reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position, the head cushion (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old (heavy) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their blends.
In the case of mattresses, the new magic word is "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, more and more natural oils are used to produce polyurethane foams - for example, castor oil and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
“Bio is the name given to mattresses, which consists of their core materials of purely natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also indulge in microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
There is also a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooler" plant extract from birch leaves is used, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprika extracts stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes quite warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiff (hardness) of cold foam and visco foam, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to pick up 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with a lower value-added tax, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was awarded this advantage.
One can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with a hidden visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.

It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launch.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it becomes stronger again.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscoelastic foam materials are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to hunt for cars, can find people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette box but it should soon be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and horror and thus keep them looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that this isn’t about spying around at all, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases, abuse of such devices can occur, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing it, but we have not had such a case to record so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, however, points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of his.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they don’t want to be controlled.”
“The mobile phones were initially high expectations for the parents, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new surveillance devices,” says Ms. Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In your opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with him or her with which to locate it.”
“Today is the phone.”
“If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them because their sale would be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead,” says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech from RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
“For more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position,” says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to record a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that they are either devices in the size of a wooden box, which are similar to the trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are now being tested.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he'll only notice that after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes in - towards bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many chains of fire that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of firecrackers, which are set on fire with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of fire cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have been out for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the spark plug - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the chains of fire from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for Lappish 40 million kroner.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of fire cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of fire cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, it is clear from this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are no exception.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fire hoses be justified by half-way.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of cord of fire is completely sufficient, then the army has given itself a calming supply for the already 22 years through these new purchases – even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Action Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they almost no longer had cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't even know why they're buying so many spark plugs from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
“For us, the Army is a good customer that we, as a trader, want to come across as a whole,” says STV Group sales manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, is justifying the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fire cords with the fact that the army had been covering itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the firing line and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
“With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible,” admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be subjected to criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested as to whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of fire line.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s supply of 244 kilometers,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of chainsaws by police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate ammunition from World War II or the Soviet fraternal army, barely exceeds 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the expiry of the service life.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, it is also possible to make flexible purchases of modern and therefore also reliable spark plugs.
However, the Ministry of Defense has huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnician, who claimed MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old chains of fire, which they have bought so "cheap" today.
To this day, I have found the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the competition "Klein entrepreneurs of the year" helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Klein entrepreneur of the year" was Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a movie script.
You know, Luke Pytlow likes to travel.
Only abroad did he become aware that in Liberec there are no good accommodation options at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he created a buildable house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties to the Pytloun hotels franchise have already signed up,” says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large proportion of this license sale to operate hotels has just won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," adds Mr. Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say that it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend to anyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You also don’t have to win right away, every visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come to him at all.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
The fame associated with the success, in his opinion, also depends a little on each of his employees.
And then he's in his 70s.
“I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given to general recognition.”
I don’t really see this as just a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is just a little something in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year last year was received by Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made in small tooling in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice to stamp a company out of the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history, there was an effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop to the pact for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and set up one with a few comrades of his father's own.
Shortly after, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also came to the attention of the non-professional public.
“Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but also our foreign partners began to appreciate the fact that they were able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, last year at Farmet was not only a sign of victory euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which shook citizens even less, but especially companies, just reached its climax – many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation.”
“The sales declined by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures as well.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one point, the company was not willing to make deductions - in the case of investments in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It all shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
An opinion poll that cleans up with illogical rules
The poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year’s poll “Absurdity of the Year” advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
More than one-third of non-four thousand voting entrepreneurs chose to do so.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper withdrawal from the trade register, even if the official could have called him by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the future when checking social security payers," Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration, said in a statement.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year" is to take all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsense.
This is already the fourth time this year in an entrepreneurial competition organised by the so-called Economic newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If three thousand people participated in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that alone serve to hinder the activity of the company.
“As for the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world,” notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Business Operators of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of company conditions, a worse ranking by eight places compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was called out for the first time in the year and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition until the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anti-price" and let the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
This year’s opinion poll has already registered more than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways have to pay to Maut or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to submit every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the competition's pages.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of an event in which people from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
“When the state throws a wedge between the entrepreneurs’ legs, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily make their businesses more difficult for the entrepreneurs,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create absurd arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on the entrepreneurs to report to the commercial officer at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of a Novelle of the Commercial Act.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the employment office trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation, which it imposed on physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category of companies that are socially responsible should be respected
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year’s fifth year of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon’s mobile phone company, “as well as the caller and guarantor of this competition.
For the first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fines enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also takes care of its health-deprived employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which they have been awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone Company of this year, they have been awarded the third company of the year.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our business activities and administration for the environment as low as possible,” explains its CEO Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, in turn, is located in the health of its employees and has therefore purchased them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition, it is promoted at their employees' work at home and at company events.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
“We provide our employees with contributions to the provision, the way of work, the increase of their qualifications and the holiday,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category Responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
“A separate registration only to this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the hosting agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public tender
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was abducted by the detectives in handcuffs.
He allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place to deal with restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsner State Attorney's Office of the newspaper "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo", unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was fired from the police again.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the scarce official information.
The floor fund spokeswoman Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> referred to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s question in this regard, the police actually made arrests in the Pilsner subsidiary of the floor fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not about one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition had the correct designation "Request for the award of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"As part of the request, these persons offer a higher value of their return claims to be accompanied by the transfer than the declared property value."
“In accordance with the proposed requirements, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid,” explains the spokesperson of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was obviously available information on who had applied for the invitation and since he himself was a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to a property interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Obviously against a fat discharge.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had very good contacts with the Pilsner Land Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota Land Fund, who was prosecuted for issuing property in replacement pensions, to which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At the time, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. bought from the Soil Fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access highway to the Borské pole business area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the estates.
At that time, the town hall had to give a small twist of heart so as not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
Starting in January, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating and some places, rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more per month from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also pollute district heating supplies.
The cost of electricity alone is a few hundred crowns more per year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only getting moderately more expensive, this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, with a few hundred crowns more is to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové have to pay up to 50 kroner per month for district heating from January, more than 1000 kroner per year pay more families in Liberec.
Prague residents, in turn, face 9% higher water and wastewater charges, in the event that the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, remains among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rental regulation is eliminated.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to take legal interest.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, except for a good whisky that was stolen from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks that Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen who enjoy drinking must be treated most often.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
“Today’s trend is clearly hard alcohol,” said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the head of the children’s department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice clinic in central Bohemia.
“Whiskey, if it succeeds in removing a bottle from the house bar to the father, and if not, then at least fart or vodka.
“Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn’t smell so strong,” explains the chief physician.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> is right.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
“It was also a question of Slibowitz, which you take home with you,” Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Chief Physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admissions are no longer an exception.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first given 3.5 ounces of alcohol in her blood and was also given in combination with ‘extase’,” the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when dealing with their own children that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
“Under alcoholism is to understand a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol as well as all associated phenomena, and this is not the case in these children.”
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains Chief Physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokesperson of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, about forty children who were drunk were admitted to the local department of pediatrics and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospital stay, go into the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of schnapps in the school bank, Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes, one hundred percent depending on: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow for the bad witness or out of joy for the holidays."
“On the Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording,” says Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better at it than a child who has to fight only with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which result from dehydration and lack of glucose, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
“They’re clearly better at it, because after the ‘beautiful’ experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without hurting anywhere.”
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes at least by eroding the good mood of the patient by telling them the cost they’ll cost the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and like to spend a few tens of thousands of crowns.
“Sometimes I used this as a means of education when I directly pre-calculated the children during the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they will have to work all the time to earn the money for a single such fete,” Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regressing procedures in order to demand the necessary costs from the parents for the treatment of the children who are drunk.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two of the five light combat aircraft L-159, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS resides.
This is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen at maneuvers or flight shows.
This is the two-seat version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are L-159 single-seat.
These are currently held in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she physically dispatches the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter jets, in turn, were separated from long-range aircraft without further investment and investment by the Ministry’s resort.
"The L-159T1 double seats have been replaced in their current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to get out without two-seat combat aircraft, as the Defense Ministry signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four redundant L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed itself to deploying the warplanes into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
“It is therefore the customer’s business, in which way he realizes the business,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tendering procedure for the purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa is also likely to have a judicial after-game.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, which is why the aircraft should have been selected on the basis of an all-European tender and should not have been accompanied by a single manufacturer's reply.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last of which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of getting cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health conditions, Ms. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index finger were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are formed already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that this study was volatile, yet he does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to date to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly fixed snow, the winter servicemen were many places all night on axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was stated by Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Klub (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At 91 kilometers, a truck crashed, at 93 kilometers, two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also located in the street pit.
There are also problems with the 185 kilometres of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided here as well.
The drivers should leave just behind Brno at 190 kilometres or over Brno and leave at 182 kilometres at the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where a kilometre-long dam is formed.
There was also an accident on the D11, which happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimetres thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto columns form, for example, in the district of Prosek, also the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow mishaps.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia can only be driven with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are local snow-conversions, and in the vicinity of Blansko, one is forced to use snowflakes on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snowflakes for snow removal.
When they are recyclable, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the region of Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, caution is advised in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered by inert means for reasons of nature protection, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia - positioning up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell in the Moravian-Schlesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
U.S. troops have deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
In fact, their projectiles are guided to the target by laser with a hit safety of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber guns, designed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from the top, so the deadly steel-split rain from the top can easily put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of “smart” technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he clears the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of view, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just needs to push back.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When pressed, the gun charges and shoots down at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced by the computer industry giant on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be moving their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in the Frankfurt district Niederdiel Nieder.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the group should be accommodated there, which have so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park were better able to cope with the work of the employees.
Even in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
Bernd Wagner, Managing Director, said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezzenten Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "Global Player" had been won.
That's a "great location confession."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the downhill.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader.
In the end, economic reasons would have made the cut.
Now it’s about preventing a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far on the Town Hall Square and the neighboring "Small Verticals" were among the most controversial construction projects in the city of Kurstadt ten years ago with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Square.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the railway station and the town hall, which provided for criticism both due to the massive construction of the previously used areas as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still associated with Siemens, acquired the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu’s Tokyo-based customers are ranked as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees are employed by Fujitsu in Munich.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is headquartered in Frankfurt-Niederrad, Germany, and the other subsidiaries at this location are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex – the name is based on its star-shaped floor plan – the central association of the electrical engineering and electronics industry has its headquarters.
Amazon shuts down servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure following the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats’ papers.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
WikiLeaks’ disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
The prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s hunt list, is set to stop in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks deprecated by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the revelation activists shared via the short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had banned WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the release of the secret diplomatic files in order to be able to handle the high numbers of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks went on to say: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers through WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted research, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier in the day in view of the previous releases of Wikileaks-classified information," he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to ban the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, reckless and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," it said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden for alleged rape, is on Interpol’s hunt list.
According to a report by the London-based newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location being Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, a coup d'état broke out.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “sad and absurd” that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recent spying requests to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases comprehensively on the test bench.
The deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after the disclosure of the messages by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks publication.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if that should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream makers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the jellyfish and the jellyfish.
The gelatiere, in German somewhat anciently the ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The gelatoio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, strips it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University of Ice has established the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the home’s own ice cream parlour.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture on the smooth ice of their vague yearnings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years wants to contribute something of her own in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice rink in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatie Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget, however, that during his training, he is also the mastermind of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance involved."
The first step to production seems simple.
Luciano kicks the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a chicken on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately the lecturer is overwhelmed with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own desire for experimentation?
Luciano warns against being deceived by the spirit of the times.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from the guarbean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sinks into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice cubes.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base, which turns into a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, moccasins and hazelnut ice cream – with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - delicious, this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn’t necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano pulls out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make computing easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small pans are not left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo disguises himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit purée, when he gets out of control by the oversized rod mixer.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Controllers in duality
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been underwhelmed by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa testing regulations for gene crops and is thus in clear conflict of interest, then criticises.
The Efsa regulations are word-for-word with Ilsi’s position papers and thus detract from the industry’s handwriting, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that test biotech has been involved in a conflict of interest.
So a high-level Efsa manager was recently without conditions or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and so I changed the sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Office of the Environment as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
However, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, are used, as long as they are of high professional quality, according to an opinion.
Experts working for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you have to disclose them.
Kuiper is working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This self-describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed to live without any feeding attempts in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn does on the field,” says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you find them?” the prosecutor asks.
Angelika Hilbeck sees this as well.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry in this area, as in the US, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not affiliated with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
“Industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snows.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators were attacked and had begun to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the station’s billion-pound downfall.
When it came to the top of the building, most of the wing was in rubble.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the blocks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He whispers, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smoked the one after the cigarette qualm.
What he's going to do with the bricks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen to a former ammunition depot of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all the people who fell for the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were grinded into gravel or disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden bungalow that was once a guardhouse.
Rumored and threatened, he says, when he was told in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition.
And if it happens now, then it is the most sensible thing if the stones are used further.
Some 200 S-21 opponents then took on one of the 80 kg squares, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rongs, 25 large truck loads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
They had come from everywhere and had taken away what they could carry trunks and trailers.
The Stuttgarter Steine der Anst<0xC3><0x9F>e has long been transformed into "M<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“It’s not the political component.”
He climbs into his off-road car, making a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
Jura studied and graduated, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stone is stored.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
It's braked.
In the snow are artificially carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke,” he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it warms.
"My favorite stone."
The road goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quads once belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow Stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from St Blasien Cathedral, tuff from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if something like that were to happen.”
He did not become rich, he did not become a stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, in addition, a stone mason, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual valuer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Struggle for High-Potentials
There's a swirl of beer in the buffet.
16 students are pressing around salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, together with VW developers, they aim to make the car of the future professional – and get to know Volkswagen next door.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms before they come to the job market and are rebuffed by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, one tries to test the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to one another.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is promoting its talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who will come into question as an employee."
Such co-operations, such as Celle, are not uncommon.
What’s new is that students are being bullied so aggressively.
“Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to boast and especially balm for highly qualified workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the KPMG audit and consulting firm, Roman Dykta goes on the hunt for talent.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt in which participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will be sending the company across the U.S. next year.
In addition, the participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When it comes to the high potentials at universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
“Only a simple sailing tow was too little for us.”
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to go up.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year."
“Some are just about to close and want to apply with us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bowling on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to the Pirsch in the traditional way at trade fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“About on the intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of staff at Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows about the youth problem.
There are currently 35 posts posted on the company’s website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not targeted at the solar specialist.
To do this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“This can often not be offered by a large group,” says Staff Manager St<0xC3><0xBC>be.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The Institute creates an annual best-seller list of German employers.
To do this, it questions employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager St<0xC3><0xBC>be also hopes that the placement will also add extra points to the job seekers.
“I think applicants look especially for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that, according to Kriegler, means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would advertise for their employer on their own.
“It’s like a game with bands,” Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drills
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington – and thus definitively revoked their previous plans.
New drillings are also prohibited on the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
In the face of the disaster, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not been definitively cleared to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately applied for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been subjected to numerous corruption allegations, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: Billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption, and illegal cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
“Don’t worry,” the eco-activist reassures the journalists: “You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to lighten a boy up to his chest in the water with the veils around him: in the rainbow-colored water glow, the scene seems almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil swabs float beneath the surface is not visible.
In the past, she used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow-flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipeline, a huge amount of crude oil poured into the wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-rich waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-spoiled regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps traversed by streams, the whole extent of the enclosure becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat swells brown breeze, who dips his hand into the water, pulling out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees graze like black licorice stems from the ground, sadly letting individual palms to be found hang their weed.
Bird heat, as it is otherwise common in wetlands, is sought in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, spooky tranquility spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari window: “We live in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement of Ogoni is a battleground that has been fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded, here organized themselves in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to work for its oil production in 1993.
Even today, the company is barred from returning to Ogoniland: While the oil fields in Ogoniland are being pumped daily from the entire delta region from the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable.
All a few hundred meters of steel frame like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year, the amount of oil they pumped into the sea in the crash of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in Alaska – one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see shattering drill heads and leaky pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner told the Group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "about one multiple times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smelted workshop under the open sky from a distance, the mangroves appear in shapes: they are split dark and oil-smelted to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the storage tank, later drips out kerosene at the end of the line and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel every day at 300 liters: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low diesel price of almost 40 Euro cents per litre can still be underestimated by the illegal cooks: because their raw material gets them for free.
It comes from “bunkers” who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: this way, according to experts across the Niger Delta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally intermediated raw material is illegally refined: the lion’s share is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and scarred on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more likely to be due to the turnover of the population or the lax mode of production, considers the activist Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders, and if they did not destroy the fishermen's livelihood so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell in particular has been so destroyed that only one of the Group’s deductions is questioned: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese stand out as better.”
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not in danger of arrest, but a painful lubricant.
The soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous building errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible build-up error in the investigation of a land-based machine that could lead to a "catastrophic power failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently much more fortunate than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety issue in its investigations of the engines of some A380 machines – and is now warning of a possible build-up.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could create fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This could have led to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had broken down and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines will now have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was considered important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The twin-roofed aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany entirely in White: Overnight snow fell almost all over the country.
Chaos, trains and flights are rampant on many roads.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowed on Thursday night – which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east are some 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in constant use, but the constantly new snow was not finished.
In addition, fierce boars fought over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is waiting on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, the snowshoeing on highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather station Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the alarm level was expected to be violet - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There remained several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind caused congestion and congestion.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and trails are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop in Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowstorms swept across the streets.
In large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there were only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there were still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads there were accidents already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in the collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: here too, a truck was caught on a train crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after hitting a smooth road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will bulge even in light rain.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is home to fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the Money House is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million the property could bring in.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernized; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group is apparently looking to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in reference to a spokesman.
The reason for the planned sale was not stated by the speaker.
“We always check to see if it makes sense to own or sell real estate yourself and then rent it back,” he said.
As a result, Germany’s largest credit institution is relinquishing its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had taken over the double-towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of a home-owned fund and subsequently rehabilitated it.
The energy conversion exceeded the data to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers in the newspaper, now renamed "Greentowers", is estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the displaced miners who were declared dead in a mine after several explosions.
Still, the bodies could not be secured, because the security situation in the crash shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were displaced during days.
A probe had been dropped into the wreckage, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand during the bright sunshine.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the friends were visible.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also took their place here.
In front of the country’s government buildings, the flags blew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also ejected.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool down, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warriors!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-imagines old genre boundaries with his warrior epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman powers, kills his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero likes to get rid of his rabid corpse
On the other hand, Ainauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film about no word, and even the other characters can be torn down to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries at most.
Otherwise, it is silent and sweltered in Scotland’s ghastly beautiful hilly landscape, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal rather for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Good, if a movie has multiple audiences, only harm if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stubbornly refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most of the art cinema friends were supposed to be afraid of the brain mass and the guts that are spraying around.
The action fans will die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, an eye-witness breaks out with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and sticks an eternity in flotilla and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany did not find a movie rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogue or a strict action, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And from that there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and, with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, slowly sniffs his throat, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that confronts him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, who is faithful to the eye, retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies at some point, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means spoiling, but maybe only for the spoiled anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and amaze.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new clues to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows checks.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor supposedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in the quad, hidden in a valley that runs off the current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Agency at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium — from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, technology hardly diverges from the fifties.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
By computer animation, she blurted out what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was in place shortly before commissioning, it said, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than at the time, yes the puzzles have become rather bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any indication that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some secret servicemen in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "legitimate reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only lapidary, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly sided with the debris of the alleged "unused military building", they planned the area thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a Member State from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was shown by the IAEA after analyzing the particles as improbable.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it forbids the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been fruitless since June 2008 and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear weapon.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and different from that still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are involved in, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (Isis) has identified these locations and, on satellite images, found a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria forbids the IAEA from accessing the three locations.
In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the U.S. intelligence agencies.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the quad on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated from it later, there are plausible assumptions about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could hold valuable traces, has been stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the debris remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its ability to store radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, footage from the orbit shows that Syria took over the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
Damascus, however, also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna weakened even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing in so-called special inspections through the game for a few months, one of the sharpest means of controlling Vienna's nuclear weapons.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who was supposed to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA’s Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but prone to escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat puts it, “What if they don’t find anything at all?”
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her yet-to-be-named directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
The screenplay she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for restlessness.
The rumour is persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some planned filming days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote about the UN refugee relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UN refugee relief agency.
It is not diplomatic - it has already offered a meeting to women in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, according to the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read their script, after a while has granted a rotational permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after that.
The young author herself insists that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
There is a second synopsis for the film on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the war broke out and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which, of course, sounds significantly different than the variant "Violence victims are entrenched in torturerknecht".
The fact that Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now you can probably only get the hackers of Hollywood Peace: by putting the script, like so many before, on the net illegally.
Nothing like leaving here
On this evening it is finally running really round again for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans rejoice at the crackling loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Cork is buzzing because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups – and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro prize winnings plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this cool drinking game and the withholding computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, and he will hold an application meeting in New Zealand in January.
“I have a bad feeling about it,” he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, pulled her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin predict.
By 2015, it is estimated that there will be 200,000 migrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered under Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing to the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are frequent letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the brook in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation.”
"Then please turn off the light."
Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future come to light because the government only operates eyewashing and no longer offers young people future prospects.
“They’re reducing the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy for how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellows hang from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is that she has to emigrate in four years herself.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to take a positive view of the issue.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
“For a career starter, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career path,” says the manager.
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere else, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just pulling a fashion house up.
In January, we move on to Hannover or Berlin, for the next project.
O'Donovan now sees his home only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, as he walks over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m almost never home again.”
He laughs a little and goes through chilled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 – 100 percent credit-financed.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions,” he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pouring hot tea and saying, "I don't have any children that I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn’t like the weaving complaint he hears often at the moment.
“No one has to starve – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Open up the future and just look at how it goes with life elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t it work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that still worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could end up in a welfare party.
“Don’t sweat too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary, though."
"Let's call it a away party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democracic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries, was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America.
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong recession last year, such a trend can be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents stated that they would be satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust their country’s Congress and 45% of their government, both of which correspond to last year’s values, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crisis undermined efforts to achieve more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, perhaps due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America in crime in their country see a bigger problem than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Some 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime in the past year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the values have dropped, thus reaching the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region stated that private economy is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents retained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year) has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An election slappe
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral assistants who rushed to the baged country for help.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes cast, ballots in the ballot box, destroyed polling stations, and intimidation were only part of the problem.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were searching around for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, called for the cancellation of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "very good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, no matter how serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular incumbent president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected selection is planned for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval from the voters, declares the electoral authority the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 IDs needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether or not she will help with a re-election next year depends on whether the visibly sad Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also pursued economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income on their own merits.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further setbacks.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others denounced the bribery government) Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money on her own merits.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and wage requirements of the unions – drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then made the official inflation statistics beautiful.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to rejoin Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt refinancing in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like it would be the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy they have been shown will be eroded.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether or not to silence her husband’s many political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, stood to elect mayors and city councils in the five urban districts. This is assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater Taiwanese independence, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, events such as truck convoys with crane makers, flag-swinging mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers took place in Taiwan.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded, and an approaching spectator was killed.
Bizarre pointers are not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Notably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time also avoided the DPP from squeezing the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, there is also a need for political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he campaigned vigorously for absolute independence.
But under Thai rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai, as the DPP's presidential candidate, found great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party is offering a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's early approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged Pragmatician Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP is finding it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no going back.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated in excess for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the Year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her 2008 album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist has been published before the release of the album, with which he has published <0xC3><0x96>fste in Brei.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her stammering voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of co-nominated Spalding.
In addition, the album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the Instrumental Albums category, which led to a huge success for the critics.
Iyer’s competitors include “Moody 4B” by experienced saxophonist James Moody and “Positootly” by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rabid New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded the Contemporary Jazz category, in which other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more likely to be found.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Musician Darcy James Argue received some well-deserved attention in the Big Group category. He thus acts against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award feature a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year five artists were nominated in the category of classic producers - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and K<0xC3><0xBC>nergy Cacal;
In the opera category were Bergs "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Cho and the Arthurs of the Suskys.
As composers, P<0xC3><0xA4>rt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic, led by Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
“I’ve used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found, after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, the unanimous agreement of the local planning committee.
Critics have accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will be in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
“As an American, I’m proud of that.”
"It shows that justice rules."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
“Wonderful people live in this valley.”
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes being fairly evenly distributed on both sides, according to Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” was one comment.
“It’s another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand.”
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is said to have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot of land on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their opinion a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
“This makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements in other planetary systems, and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily specified," explains Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the University of Milton.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemical behavior similar to that of phosphorus.”
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
“But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it almost everything is smeared,” explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office report on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are healthy,” Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the whereabouts of the dogs nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rumble, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from Dog Show to Dog Show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer's wolf, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery cart because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's salary to anyone who could give a clue to the corgis, and microchips were implanted to identify the animals.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “prepared” creditor plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for new movies and TV shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually comes into effect only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself invests $75 million, is running the company. The funding is expected to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order of Moelis & Co, the company’s management, who struggled with $300 million/year in interest payments to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial worries and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from the front, when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for running the company, receives a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has funded about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can break a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game equals about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronics toys under $80 for three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
It immediately became clear to me that Moore’s law came into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button-operated toys are coming on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children up to 3 years) are plush characters, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by repeatedly pressing you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games like 'Simon says', and thanks to its innovative hinged legs with wheel lock, it dominates the Moon-walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids from 3), with a whole bunch of quizzes that can turn a car ride into a class hour, with a better whistleblower with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child’s smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the LeapsterRe.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for kids from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time runs out, and it’s great for an improvised lettering competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you only go to the toy shops after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child in the Club Penguin Store will receive enough credits for two more parts.
These can be roller skates or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of trouble through a garden of clumps.
And he's holding on to something.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
China's police operations are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates, and issued commands with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan—China’s robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their hanging on to violence—to impress the audience.
"Really standing!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up in their teens, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants, stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair with blue and white striped hair.
“For me, they look average,” Mr. Tang notes with low regard.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-rise: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly surrounded an improperly set-up ambulance and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city’s police lanes and have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good character and their youth.
They are supposed to give the grotesque police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would also hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Right, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may only enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone while she was shooting a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics find the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October via an ad, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job postings, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
“The most important thing is their image,” an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether candidates get the job first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that, they still have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not want to impose this description,
But admitted that in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this should be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
“Unfortunately, we cannot use laminas or buckling here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that such great value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the grubs, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than just shaming traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many buns and buns as possible on foot or on the bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
“We’ve told you this so many times!” explains Fr. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies salesmanship in his spare time.
"All Routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals by notifying them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ransacked after the rumor spread that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where female officials were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired against the regulations on the civil road instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and proceeded with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, stayed behind, turning his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But sometimes it's physical," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start arguing.”
Attorney General will not be charged with Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were raised against him after his affair with a former Electoral Assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator’s attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and left a supporter of his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been halted and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 suggested that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, helped to gain lucrative contracts to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a Treasurer during an election campaign for Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton's job, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over for her after setting Hampton's lobbying job.
As Hampton was recently still on Ensign’s electoral team, he was not allowed to take lobbying jobs for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had been close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it seems to be about an agreement and the violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are under the government’s purview.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Ministry appears to be very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats, which have been pursued by the media with great interest in prosecuting
State attorneys "are obviously appalling," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers facing various charges.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s attorney general, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a state attorney on Monday and another the next day that he was told that the ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers had cooperated with the state attorneys to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “has acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors in more detail.
“I’m not sure I’m going to go into the details of the conversation between the Justice Department and myself, just to be clear: we believe we made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend the investigations for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that has long supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An email from December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton transferred as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "on" at the Interior Ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had an appointment with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had suspended Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When, for the first time last year, information about this matter was brought to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the Republican rankings.
After not being noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and set its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire Call Makes Attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them shoved themselves into the crows in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on gruesome witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape process and children chained to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the carefully prosecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the jury's death sentence falls.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court, which will explain the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process – even through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – it has become a “circus atmosphere” and a so widespread, circumstantial penetration of intrusive details, so that the jury has been blown away.
This objection could cause the appellate courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced during this process, I believe it really is a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s attorney general.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, briefly and bluntly rejected the applications by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on famous-famous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" due to the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr. Haye’s conviction considers half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication pathways from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
The defendants also claim that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome tattoo photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her granddaughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he had inadvertently exerted pressure on the judge to believe that he had misled the defendant.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a ruling they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a daily appeal of the media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Your focus on reporting via Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more uplifting than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly is a technically hostile view that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court’s decision of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was overturned for reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against 21st-century Maxwell."
Can politeness connect the dividing line?
After a campaign of words and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the top of Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the big issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the session at the end of a period of government in which no decisions were made anymore.
After all what you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial dot collection.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington has been mild.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after the election.
Elections create partisan passions that die out again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is advocating that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporary or permanent.
Equally, a compromise is to be expected with regard to increased unemployment benefits, even if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while denying support to the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START contract.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful co-operation in urgent matters of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent co-operation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also sceptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – leads courtesy to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the formation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were serving their education.
As concerned Republican leaders may also be about being too high in poker, they know they need to try to keep their promises to lower government spending and put health reform out of power.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of state spending.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the committee, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for play or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes, and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are larger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a much more consequential 2012 election.
In this way, the courtesy that will be displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two from each other.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery money and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “verticals of authority” – takes its share of the money that leaders are moving upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations over years, and he has won numerous defamation lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television channel when asked for documentation suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has been reported in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocracy than a government," the memo said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krishna’ (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection), which extends over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the office of the Prosecutor’s Office as well as through Moser’s office.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands for Colonel Stelle."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on stage two."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors are following at the lowest level."
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB cashes money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
A source said: “Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer required as before.”
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don’t pay find their business closed very quickly – due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noticed that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, in an interview recently.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, it is estimated that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late in Moscow’s time, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes Moscow has made, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to be such an arrogant joke, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Face the Past
In a poorly lit, stressed classroom with dirty and flickering walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation to the government, long-standing supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“It splits families themselves.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of disease, revision or before starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation into Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run for government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crumbling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officers held their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The court’s task is to convict the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the tarnished grass, In Chaem refused to discuss its past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had invited her, she would have refused to go, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Conciliation with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand how everything is.”
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education’s High School, which contains less than four pages across the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path covered by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned on a pile of tires here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus Agrees to Collect No Longer Weaponable Uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
The deal appears to be one of Obama’s most important results of the April “47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit” that had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear security summit [of 2012].
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... we're not going to make any dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that ran more than 1,300 miles to a Russian plant for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dissolve its stockpile by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approach.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of its country and its people,” he said.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, as evidenced by a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in documents leaked by WikiLeaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish government be informed of the need to "reveal" to prove that the Spanish government should be "informed of
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid for human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had hit Zapatero by the side" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed,” so as not to be “unpreparedly surprised,” Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has few possibilities of influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service (CNI) and the Minister of Defense over the CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information,” the ambassador said after an interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the U.S. was more concerned about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutor” than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate, they have to refrain from commenting on the instructions
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government of Zapatero’s actions by the United States, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, would have tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. capital, even though these disclosures may have been negatively impacted by U.S.
The child killer admitted that she complained on the Internet about the "m<0xC3><0xBC>hsal" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician manner"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is online "Muki".
Under this name, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her love life, which the ABC daily reconstructs on the basis of testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look at the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who accompanied her to Palma for even a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
“When I told him that, he liked it, but now he naturally notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let him do what he wants.”
She later mentions a message she just received on her phone: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address that I can send the boy to.”
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy at my mother's, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her first-born with her when everything is going well.
"He's going to be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I ever leave him again with anyone except my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another email in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly was murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not satisfied."
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day.”
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A huge kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail, you see, if he wants me, he'll find me, that's a mess."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, has one: "He's throwing me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked down, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison release".
"Terror a la gallega (<0xC3><0x9C>berschrift)".
The last man who lived with her, a committed hunter-gatherer, explains having conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred from the Menorca Center for Prisoners to the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday.
The obligor, Carlos Maceda, declared that she could not remember the course of the affair, "and she did not intend to inflict minor damage."
Before that, however, she had confessed that Caesar had drowned in the bathtub and had buried his body in a suitcase.
Defense and public prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a decisive role
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its gaze on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of votes in the elections.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend—the result of the PSC’s turnout and the PP’s voter turnout—would continue, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would win four (she now has 10) and the PSC would win out.
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MEP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MEP or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Also then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to bring an end to socialist rule, namely in four provincial capital cities and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists achieve neither a majority nor can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not inevitable that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to get 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona’s transition, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 urban administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Letter was the car)
The Spanish interior minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" worldwide and "with their capacity to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda is composed, so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europeans and others without penalty.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network active in Europe. That is why, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation. It is not to be excluded that it will be carried out on the EU territory in the coming days, similar to the attacks on Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athanhar Butt and Ze were executed.
They had led from Bangkok to the cell that had been settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network – some of which had been destroyed in 2009 – in particular stole tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called “International Islamic Front”.
This means that the documents must be issued on the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and must be valid for several years; they must not have a visa stamp.
Investigative circles are underscoring that so far no links between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay have been proven, although the author of the attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack on Catalonia by means of a money transfer company, several thousand dollars had been sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando", the life of a person of 106.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP calls on Mas to represent the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present to Artur Mas their conditions in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those already established during the election campaign and do not allow himself to be regional with the priority of economic recovery.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who awarded her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. For the candidate of his position at the civil-regionalist party is a member of the opposition party CiU
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress will depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As for the party president of the PPC, he demands that in support of the inauguration "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia", as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to that of the Basque Country - be submitted to a party leader.
It is common for both political leaders to make the built-up political apparatus of regional administration leaner and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas are discussed on the side of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not rule out that their caregivers killed over 11 elderly people
The managers of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the damage done to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - the one responsible.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to charge the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to do so and the civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social prestige because it had not identified the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and disease.
The head of La Caritat denied this point around and stated that "delayed measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there was no evidence in the lawsuit for negligent acts of any person other than the accused.”
He confessed to eleven murders yesterday, declaring that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and that he murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat stated that the access of personnel to the drugs is difficult to control.
Insulin injections and tranquilizer cocktails were used by caregivers in six out of nine crimes committed to rid patients of their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them lead, as he had done in three women, according to a confession he made between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the caretaker, not even in terms of the number of confirmed murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to follow his procedure carefully.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
Threats to the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reactionary ability."
The risk exposures of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be fooled and the euro has hardly added points, which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to make a drawdown tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for an end to the plan for the purchase of public debt, as it was ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional fixed-term liquidity measures, and only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the quarter-end to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and to deliver a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be rebuffed, and if it is stubbornly insistent that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, in which the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of government debt securities and the subsequent collapse of markets, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and sustainable.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government’s asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points in the entire curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets, according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval on its new budget next Tuesday, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government more moderately on December 14th, where political unity is asked to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
Yesterday, the Spanish Prime Minister presented the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and labour procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond, which will benefit from the trichet effect, and that is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to repay debt.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife's motto: "Now counts not only being, but also appearance."
Only courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, will contest the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not disappoint.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the corporate umbrella, will challenge the shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them to be “absolutely negativity”. His children will try to get a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - Wei<0xC3><0x9F>eberin
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not appear to be willing to surrender control of El Enebro’s organs in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new Thursday in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The judge’s call for the convocation of the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the shareholders’ meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to expose the fraudulent practices and abuses of law that have been declared null and void for January 18.
This argument is the basis for the assembly’s subsequent opposition to declare it “absolutely null.”
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting on the judicial path.
At El Enebro - the property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter to be decided by the judge in the hearing to deal with the dispute, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this acclaimed universe has been characterised by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid any attention to the new one and despite his steep rise during the last season, at the end of the race last November, everyone was betting on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without the ability of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the multi-siemens Red Bull put in their hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company brought to the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
It is intended to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 – the Red Bull factory “in a few hours, almost in real time” can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm reports that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the race halls who could introduce three or four improvements in a season at most.
Today, the Red Bulls team employs 180 highly qualified young people, and with powerful EDV systems, they conduct analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred into reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits – especially by journalists – are severely limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the service of its participation in the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their reputation is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant’s chief technology officer, stressed that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20-owned stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) today announced its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies plans to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are based in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same, based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and pointed out that with the exclusive sales outlet network it was intended to "customer service and advice from small and medium-sized companies when shopping and after, yes, even to optimize packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
“In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system has been developed especially for small and small businesses as well as private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to ‘steal’ its rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break-in of interest rates that banks attempt to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years – a subject still to be established.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers who will lose the bank - that is the big challenge this bank faces, because until now it has noticed more of its business.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual accounts.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as all the plans of the banks worldwide have been confused by the financial crisis.
Sabadell will complete its guidance plan Optima set four years ago this year, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings funds are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only “slow” coming out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - punishing the interest margins - will fade, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity will already be applied to the price of loans as a compensation for swinging profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high,” Guardiola added.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase interest differentials (see Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the statement "to increase fees", but "within a framework characterised by competition".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“In the coming year, everything will change,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently “increased enormously” and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slide in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that FROB can replace the money market in the case of capitulations.
After he assures that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he debunks the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo operations and thus the crisis can be resolved.
CECA shuts off a second fusion wave of the savings funds
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a fusion wave of savings funds and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparkasses began, several Sparkasses did not participate in the first phase, and they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the General Director of the Spanish Sparkasse Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that instead of seventeen, we have thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the due process, which was fixed in earlier times, not now, in the framework of the business plan of Bange Erber.
“The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a number of unresolved opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed unseriousness and senselessness", because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” the whole world, adding that those who doubted did so “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic downturn, we need not worry "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary work enterprises or the abolition of 426 euros of support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, and the privatization of unemployment benefits, up to a rate of 49%.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former president Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has voiced the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is assumed that Merkel’s position is not a mistake of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In the face of the resistance in Europe, three possible ways out of the crisis are beginning to be speculated in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark – although it sounds more like Science Fiction at the moment – supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly, a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the payment adjustment of some countries as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinct for some time, which is why there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was designed as anti-European as it drove the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think to exceed it.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures need to be taken now - there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the opposing countries are severely penalized, can be forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector has to bear part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we have to hit a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was pointed out by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do a bad thing if we didn't understand.
It’s not just about lowering the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass in more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that will be offered to us until spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite criticism of Merkel, she has the hypothesis that her own house is in order.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
Among the possibilities that are being considered is that we should not rule out leaving the euro area, which is completely blocked with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being spilled on whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the ensuing debate about the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem of nobility and honour and had on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and to the dramatization of his story by Mourini, more to the point that his story was more than a dramatization by Mourinho, who was more inclined to his story than a play by Techersoho.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether these behaviours, which are not expressly prohibited by the statutes, are contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a regulatory framework. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid offending players taking an unjustified advantage of the opposing team, and that did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by false play or rule change, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the sanction gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was neither put in a more unfavorable position nor benefits were claimed for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The obvious advantage is that players begin the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, as the team could at some point also be eliminated, and with this approach, players will receive a sanction and move on to the second card cycle, in which they will be eliminated with a card collection less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players didn’t want to circumvent any sanctions (it would actually be a clear case of rule change), they would rather choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping a punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose due to two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The harm inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic in nature.
Offer Offensive to Catch Customers for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year leaves an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas season, which bring oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure businesses. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive, to catch the customer segment, which is the big crowd, with a lot of people wanting to spend a lot of money: almost everyone wants to spend 20 euros on the farm, and a lot of food.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (silver falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinners to two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay these out of their own pocket.
No matter what the economy is, minimum prices are required, confirmed Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s, president of Barcelona’s hospitality agency.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'ten times before they reserve.'
“They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads to a collapse of the providers.
The Soteras group says the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which hosts 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led to pre-bookings of the calendar, even from early November.
“We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros,” he explains.
At AN Group, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, one does not lose optimism after the second quarter, the revenues are back blooming and good, although concentrated on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are met.
Sources of the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than a price tag. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why employees are invited again, which gives the impression that group dinners are back on the rise.
On the sides of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the club, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, relies on it to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are "alive" overall.
The fun of celebrating, however, did not go back, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concerns in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks' revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the WikiLeaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the verge of clarifying and judicious details, which offer documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not rapidly intensifying but rather "decreasing" rather than "decreasing" the situation in Asia.
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but stored their components to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack – prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones,: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked territory, the likely spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of nuclear transport".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs will no longer be considered by the United States alone, but also by Russia to be exhaustive and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly credible personnel to monitor nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterpart.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is slowing down in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to offers of assistance or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official with the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirmed that “despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the Supreme Leader of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify to the person responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent support of terrorist groups."
Searching for WikiLeaks boss
Obama has appointed a high-level official for the fight against terrorism to prevent further revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about Assange's "finding and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
It's not new, it's coming out on November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens' lawyer assures, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange, "to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states consider the red alert as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular where it is subject to a bilateral extradition agreement, and where it is subject to the provisions of the English extradition agreement.
The move angered Assange’s lawyers, who published the gestures in a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for leave from Sweden and was compared with the so-called Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of security of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal chase," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother blames Australia for her son's innocence - Assange stands in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time magazine via Skype an interview from an indefinite place, asking for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and thereby violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism officer, Russell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to give Assange less attention is in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and to support or contribute to them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
“Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and potential presidential candidate.
“Anyone who leaked information to the government is guilty of treason, and anything that is not execution is just too mild a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in the ERC with an eye winker
The Republican leader allows the party to secretly vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe for the deadliest time of an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC, which, after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote, is heading out of the way.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Card-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as her mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as others.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra with an eye winner tries to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the start, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak privately about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Karodists wanted to miss a criminal record for the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as of subjugation among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Card supporters demand more from the president than just the party to provide his office, an insufficient gesture as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the supreme body of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the Management Board will present to the Council for its vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to pay for Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, which in turn is to promise to present to Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologist, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party chairman is being supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from the carods environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes that will allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
The Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has been fighting for the last two congresses since the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - has been obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 sitting, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending as infogle of the internal rest of recent years the approach to this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors on the loose, the time might have come to reassess this issue and conclude it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were recorded in Mexico less than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to the MILENIO México census, four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the previous month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, probably related to the organized crime.
Among the cases stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm-induced shots, the mercy shot was delivered to his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the road Mixtecas in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n settlement of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, rural workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the highway Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message was probably found signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man with eight gunshots was murdered after he left his house to do his job as a garbage driver.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were sentenced to life in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc neighborhood of Ecatepec due to head injuries.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the mercy shot in his forehead was found on a lonely road in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge shell shot down with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage canal of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency department searched for the rest of the body parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n notified of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada. The hands were tied to the back and the head was connected.
The man had an injury that came from a firearm shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month there were reports of the murder of two men who were covered in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in blankets in the Zoquiapan settlement of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found the body of a man covered in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news that his killers left next to him, probably Marios.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with gunshot wounds was found in her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding images were discovered on the woman’s skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape were discovered and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message supposedly signed by a criminal organization, on which it said: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found holding hands and feet with traces of torture inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and bounded in black plastic bags, next to it was a message. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China Continues Its Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
China’s representative stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and it would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China expects to reduce its supply of greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states with those of the central state and the municipalities had cooperated to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, some multi-year plans have already been attacked or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the program for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in the country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be commonly thought.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States there are 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, unprecedented progress is being made in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party president has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had been right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview before the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, as governor of the state, declared that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that had been made at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent authority,” he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional emerged from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly elect the or the best president it would need for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff "to those whom the Council would appoint."
"I'm very unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to hand over the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's surge in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. That is why "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure Gabino is at the level of requirements."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech as part of his four-year government, César Nava called on supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and even less censorship.
Obama is on Twitter for the benefit of undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act – Act, then call your senators and push for the passing of this Act,” the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act – Law on Legalization and Documented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the passing of this law,” Obama tweeted.
His short message contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, it’s time to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except to extend the tax cuts from Bush’s time and to extend government funding.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockage of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects could be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be settled before the end of the year..."
“I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law that would allow the initiative to legalize and document students from next Thursday in the Senate could be voted on, although the next one would be welcome.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American Dream would be about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under the age of sixteen while living in that country for the past five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That’s why the Dream Act advocates need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most overrated Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they explained that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest hurdles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature, and she was celebrating it at this time.
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble", the Argentinian writer's office spat sweetly against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this Marisol Shultz-moderated round table Mayro at the Mayrez table at the Mayrez
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to find out what a "wrath" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not know the answer, but rather,
She leaves the infectologist convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who robbed her of her breath in the middle of the walk, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "learned only from the wound that it really is open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mixes.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Lob of the Invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who touched the clouds, returned far-traveled men, or restored the lost virtue of a girl. The story made a comeback and told of America, the great novel, which from the beginning it does not tell of the D<0xC3><0xAD>tllo and its own chronicler.
“Cervantes, who invited all of us [the writers], ridiculed the preposterous witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told – with imagination that even gave up the sense of shame.”
However, he points out that “it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best,” and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the ‘Tradition Cervantes’.
"From him we have inherited to be what is being told."
When Mayra Montero was in the lineup, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban woman and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wounds of social violence that her country – like all of Latin America – is facing as a result of the struggles over drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, non-intentionally planned commitment,” she said, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment, as if it were a “chemical reaction” between the author and the reader.
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even the intellectual habits and control of consciousness over dogmatisms run out, and will forget that "there is a little no behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
"To possess our thought and reality, we must nuance: And nuance often means to put the finger in the wound and to annoy those who feel much more comfortable when they in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in the pre-made ideas of the world, to incite the senses without nuances, to incite the senses, and to incite the senses without the senses.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match, two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, are also facing each other, and their encounter with opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has played with the medal as the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and amazingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the stakes in hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Raya.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a rebound again, as the game went 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but on the 11th, he came to the game with 3-1 and got two chances to lose his title, but he lost his title.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. That is why he does not want to be chased by misfortune once again and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he confirms that the game is the most important thing for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," he said.
The last final game is still very much in his memory, he assures not to have learned much from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared to play the line, the players are also playing, we are playing the last time, we are playing the last time
Knowing that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooting does not bother him, because he confides in his players: "You never want to arrive at the elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for this game in the past time we were ready for the next time we were ready to play, but we were ready for the next time we were ready
It is in Romanso Power to not just be the second champion and for the first time to taste the glory that the titles bring with them.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves at the consulate at the visa application services before speaking; costs are reduced waiting times in this way.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and Consulates.
During the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation at the consulate at the Visa Application Services (ASC), the initial letters in English.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be checked by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa decrease, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered separately.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa with application (including a temporary worker visa) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who want to extend their visa only do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only need to imagine at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate will stay there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo are no longer required to pay the $26 service fee.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency has called a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in the universe.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., at 1 p.m., by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
Upon convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervising discovery for the search for extraterrestrial life", triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be indistinguishable. It was hypothesized that these could turn into intelligent creatures – like humans – if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the shores of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some ways, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource, taking into account this ability, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologist, it is proven that "there is actually another life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its fund at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference, geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th Legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already installed, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who introduced themselves as an independent. The four questioned the following: the incorporation of the 'two-party system'.
Prior to the opening session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organ Law, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency led by the panelists Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political stance with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, they would go out of their political will, and if they did not have it, they would be re-submitted by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
“So far I have come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that don’t even take into account the opinions of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
“For starters, this group starts with five MPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more,” Convergencia said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in reference to PAN and PRI, explained that Congress has now turned into a 'bought' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now you divide it into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo called for the Members to be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"It must not be allowed to be left out because of the top decisions of five, which are likely to be made by these nine Members. The five, which are currently seen as split into different factions, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, we have not been relegated to the other
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Administration pays another check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued on 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 on 16 November was issued for the purpose of "Invoicing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because it sells at overpriced prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and as a result the number of checks that are still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, it’s just paid off the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "showed up" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two from October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and the last from November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is challenged by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality had counted over 10 million pesos with 42 pesos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities, the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad image on the port city to pay special attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Trade Union of the Dorada Zone, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and walkways had had been negatively impacted as tourists came to hike and saw the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don’t think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn’t be doing the construction work that way, slowly and unplannedly.”
Hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist would have brought attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
“The community has to take responsibility and avoid doing something like this again. How is it supposed to do it? Now, through preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterlife,” he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a foreign traffic area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unattended and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
“Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions are constantly on fire,” he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents represent just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed how important it is to save the tourist places of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, because they would not be properly used and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to Vordermann together with the city, and to make the city clean, orderly and attractive for foreign traffic should be a priority.
"Luckily, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive to foreign traffic and to supply them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP Demands Results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s corporate sector calls for a dignified parliament, free from compromises, to the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and another from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurial Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the MPs really exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival comparators of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and above all, they are committed to society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their confidence in the last elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation.”
With regard to the foreign transport industry, he called on the new Members to allocate the necessary value in the state budget in order to promote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"I have understood that it is the ministry with the second smallest means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects need to be allocated funds, state security needs to be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
Holy King is being sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family wish desperately.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next day, because the household is no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toy and the clothes they are looking forward to.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement, where they live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes hard times are predicted because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I'm going out with the gourds to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would love a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old sister Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I said to him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Northeast.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, 10 house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie as part of the demolition of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they are said to have served mainly in drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec’s security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the drug ring’s main wire drawer.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the court building in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, among other things, with the charge of the production of cannabis, its ownership for sales purposes, the whole and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which went on for over a year.
“The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests,” Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit of the Quebec Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be traced without difficulty
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, will be stamped out in anticipation after the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
“I’m standing with a party that has set traps at your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seafarer for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the proposed Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also pointed out that he could not support the bill because it was against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
Criticism regarding the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by the hand that demand, her party did not behave steady enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is exactly what we are trying to implement by means of another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children in captivity for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a footman.”
“They expect Canada to take tough action,” said the response from Minister Kenneys.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government has rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that any opposition MPs would immediately declare themselves to their constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on the subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unity against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, was not at all discussed.
Nor was it lacking in the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit enchanted by the hat" as well as "a solution built right at a table".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who feared that the political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he explained.
“The only way to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (university of higher administration).
In order to get out of this alley, he suggests to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the Financial Audit Office so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he decided.
He is also of the opinion that Quebec could grant the same powers as the Commissioners of audit control, which would also allow it to oblige people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the cabinets of the Charest government.
Quebec will also be required by Ottawa to amend the Penal Code in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of criminal prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelizations concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the penal code had not been updated.
As a result, Ottawa passed the Anti-Gangstertum Act.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have erupted in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, an earthquake occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been pre-evacuated.
In the evening another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rain fell in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re become the object of flood monitoring and continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Juliene, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn down due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to remain on alert and closely monitors the situation, said security adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebecer Landeshochwassercentrum issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially assigned
Quebec-based radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his poor speaking on radio.
The CCNR represents the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to their own opinion, but certain statements would have "inaccurate information about social welfare and unlawfully negative representations of the Haitians as well as the fact that such a day-to-day
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, is in violation of the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint from the "Front common of the people assisted social du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should give solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed here is that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" in question would have cut a sensitive issue in a family justice and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not treated with any tadel towards his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements that had been made regarding the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-affected discussion on this subject that provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated not to have donated in favor of Haiti’s aid, as it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians.
"I've already fined my three-day suspension in this matter."
“My record has been young for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board stresses the spread of an unsatisfactory form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was to have communicated its decisions once during the main broadcast time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montrealer of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thaiboxing, is now climbing in search of new challenges to the Tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who don’t like the fight on the ground, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, the person working as a security officer and his rivals employed by UPS had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing A at the Amateur World Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thaiboxing,” he said.
“I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China.”
“It was those fighters from every category who had been placed among the top four in the last World Cup.”
"I got my baby in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"In 2005, I became a backlash in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm, I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where fist and footstrokes as well as floor throws are allowed.
The two fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer, who emerged from this type of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese-born Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
“This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their heads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has, in mutual agreement, approved $450 million in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to oversee this important hydroelectric project in the amount of 5 billion dollars.
In early 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and de-emphasizes the competition."
“This means that instead of playing away games in a secret way, they are now conducted in an open form,” Sylvain Simard, a PQ member, told a news conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently stating in Abrede that the deal was a card game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, adding that the PQ had gone "unreasonably" and that it was "misleading her to hardness".
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologised.
The consortium’s model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in terms of a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its workload.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competitive battle being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even with relatively simple projects, is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flyover of the Quebecer Company Register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has caused the nose to crumble over the fact that the contract on project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will accelerate up."
“So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mars and you tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.”
“The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had obtained 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they “financed” before she clarified that it was rather about their executives.
Barometers of sustainable consumption - The "green" label is not reliable
Greener, but undeniably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but equally little in the brands or eco-labels that are intended to control his choice.
Shame, although it bathes in a media-active universe, where it shies away from information in favor of responsible consumption only in this way: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that has become known as the brake of its commitment to the reader.
Although they advanced the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to be offering little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as in green corporate advertising, according to the measurement instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers have doubts about the credibility of official certificates, which are supposedly fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
By the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently being nurtured by only about one-third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, the information’s emptiness and dubious character dampened the jealousy of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are distrustful of the stated performance of the green products and services they are seeking to provide.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their belief.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – Quebec’s homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, which tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by cooling itself.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to be stopping in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or that they prefer the transportation hubs to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behaviour survey were also in favour of joining and cycling, which feeds the clichés.
Government bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, did not receive what they had hoped to return to its actual cinematic function.
The Government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a level lower than initially expected, which could bring a viable solution to advantageous conditions to life, at least in the opinion of the sources detachable from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has since been summarily corrected down.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinemas and cinema complexes had raised against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris by making the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there, nor did he have to provide other cinemas there.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment applied for substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for over ten years, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients on the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini, are leading a privately funded campaign, from which they hope to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only a single screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call up the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the down corrected proposals that were made to them.
The Secret of Complexly Shocked Canada Aired
The new U.S. diplomatic lines, spread by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the feeling of superiority of the latter over Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relationship in mind at the time of the election, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more picturing details than the mere substantive content one has to grapple with.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the actions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A Canadian-nearly-inhabited inferiority complex may cause Canadian political leaders much more to talk about the internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to impeach the black Peter (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade).
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it.”
The ambassador understands this "early silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he assesses, “should it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the entry of the ballot box.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in a message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a Ottawa executive, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help ensure the government's continued existence in the federal budget vote of confidence in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a $30 to $40 billion bailout program," Breeze wrote.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from collapsing from the coalition and the so-called continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed curfew program.
Another message, written by Ambassador Wilkins from January 2008, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle hints of Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also depictions for purposes of CIA muscle proselytizing.
Once again, another statement details how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe was ready to take on certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "has handed over to the Secretary of State a paper in pointo Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the files again".
Finally, we note that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
The UN has proposed a plan in Cancun yesterday to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be realized to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the footsteps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKW emitted to the Earth due to the lighting would be avoided if the white-hot bulbs, which are still a 50-70% monopoly on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better (light-emitting diodes).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, one would have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to stabilize the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week – this company, by the way, has participated in the UN study – have a lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-light bulb, which is expected to cause an increase in the level of savings.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the gains that each country would make thanks to this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is excited to announce the results of the elections
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underscores the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"He calls on all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to include any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had allowed the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, to be circulated three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would “continue with the work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from around the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation of “fraudulent” voting in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was obtained by the former rebel camp of Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN-trained maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has dismissed the delay in announcing the election results as “unacceptable” and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held for the coronation of the process of unification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held accountable in the event of any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (with the inclusion of overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More closely, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but they wanted to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
For their part, seniors have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points seen over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a discussion about its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, however, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) versus 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was taken into custody in the course of an investigation into the public and under suspicion of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with corruption, corruption, corruption, corruption, bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the public prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brain spines."
“It’s easy for him to make a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the department, had made it worthwhile to provide the judge with a memorandum of justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
One of Guérini’s relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than to keep his deposit, which he had to direct, running.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the related funds, according to Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne City Hall, was also charged on Wednesday with bribery and complicity, but then on the pretext of staying away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief public prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people had been charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “unauthorized influence and passive bribery”.
Two civil servants of the Aubagne municipal area, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Interference and Disruption of the General by a Public Service Officer", and the other on the grounds of "co-operation in the case of the confiscation of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "healing and undermining social assets".
Among the persons facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public-hand fraud that had affected Corsica.
The kidnappers suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the awarding of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, is carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It follows from close sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elysée Palace Exaggerates Its Mediation Function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying", the French public in breath, shifted the diplomacy in alarm and accentuated the interlocutor's concern.
All this under the watchful eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" provide some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice to deal with their own crisis of “conceived hostages” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a French prisoner who has been held captive by the U.S. judiciary for trafficking in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they set the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in liberating Clotilde Reiss in a green light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A Diplomat Telegram edited in Paris on August 12, 2009 bears the title "Iran: French Comments on the Way of Dealing with Seizure".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without hesitation" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially when the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because "silence solves nothing", past the discussion attempts on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in escape maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "regular, Iranian tactic": "hijacking for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on August 16, the day she flees to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he makes it plausible that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding from Iran on account of illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison, according to a judge in Paris.
The American message, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the illegal Iranian networks of acquisitions of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of Iran against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renegotiation with Kathleen Allegrine on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to stand up to it.
“There has been a steady exchange between the French presidency and the French justice minister” (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the judicial decision,” he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "stricter" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant selects a phone number, re-posts, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently located in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During Clotilde Reiss’s incarceration in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make “escape attempts” organized by the media believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced central role.”
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 calls up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what so much "thank you" is based on against Mr. Assad, the Parisian message is asking itself.
"Despite their full praise statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which at the time was perceived as premature and unearned by "many critical voices in France and abroad".
“The Syrian role building up” Paris is trying to “keep an eye on Syria, which can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region”.
The goal is also to “sew the discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them after all."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Aspen Brothel,” which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from accessing them, government officials said.
A bill calling on online gaming operators to ban young people under the age of 16 from accessing these games after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, described representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also with having a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial representative of the French news agency Agence France Presse, in consultation with the draft law.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies would have had time for a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also looking into asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the official added.
It will also provide those individuals who wish to provide free programs that allow it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intense Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
In stark excitement over suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which rankings for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then look a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its headquarters in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of the world.
The machinations behind the scenes therefore threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was behind the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC had once again given the ground to feed it on Monday by airing a documentary report that shoots three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
The reason is enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a re-release of the chess train, which was succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-evaluate the image of England in front of the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport) has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the inevitable hint at the British press’s views is “an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote” on the part of the committee members.
“You’re throwing them with shit, you’re trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, reinforced by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, headquarters of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates appear to be premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will leave the Asian chances at 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift) acquiesced by the European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: Open Knowledge
De Gaulle had really stuttered.
In the middle of the night, he thought he was kicking.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not well on the side of the mystery that attaches to the presidency function.
So you have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs announced that a third mandate would not be excluded without even believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone to make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians would make the prospect of "two mandates" sound, had therefore spread a bit of feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It's a long way off.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You have at least seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
Accelerating the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal, which causes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS urge earlier than assumed to campaign.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a survey by BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded immediately and cautiously.
“If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
“He will always believe in being able to win,” corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with open-mindedness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government documents
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt to not allow itself, no doubt, to effect the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in favour of resolving Europe’s public budget debt.
She did not dare to say whether she felt that the central bank could do even more, for example by revoking her program of purchasing government bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, said that on the eve of his hearing in Brussels, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament did not speak out very much about his projects, but rather that we would be pleased to point out that the programme of the Sep K<0xC3><0xA4>nu
The only certainty: the ECB will leave its interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, Treasury bond purchases from the ECB doubled to approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion last week.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion in purchases.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is not in any doubt (see page 29).
The Volkswirts no longer expect a remarkable change in price.
If the loan transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will be able to create unlimited reserves of funds in any way, over a period of one week to three months.
People’s leaders are already aware that this measure will expand by a few months.
“I can’t imagine the ECB changing its programme in a significant way.”
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” Michael Schubert, a Volkswirt of Commerzbank, said in a statement.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions in the public debt market, the ECB “should maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that enlivens the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“It must enter the market at all costs at the expense of the missing investors and act in such a way as to prevent the early enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bond holder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates were to go up in the air, the states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government goes undercover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, had described the situation as "undoubted" and had expected to hear it with an "unpredictable" weekend, which, however, the person concerned immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” said Irwin Stelzer, a researcher at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, volatile tax revenues, which put the state in danger of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate budget is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates, the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, too, the revolt around a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
“The fundamentals of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with the IMF with Italy.
“At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt rate of 119.2% of GDP in 2011, requires less stabilisation progress than other countries,” observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of OEC Volks.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the proposed elections could be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a rather favourable period for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been proven both on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, this cannot be the case from the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt label, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on the banking systems,” said the opinion of the people’s leaders of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and in the further sense with their counterparts of the G20 are moving forward well.
And this also in terms of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The list of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the euro area countries is at the crossroads of markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first issue of advertising paper by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF’s additional, direct commitment to the fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are in favour of structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures, however, are expected to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other must at all costs avoid having to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on essential structural reforms that will give them lasting confidence.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the public debt markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his trip to Paris on November 24, had first come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital’s public figures, in terms of the European public debt market, judge that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are being met.
Snow and Ice Cream: 24 Departments in Alarmstufe Orange
The snow episodes are still attracting traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and are threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert level Orange due to the threat of snow and ice ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alert stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes tangent the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm, also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic jams and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who refrain from using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses was wiped out all day long.
In Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evenings.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be most cautious on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to clear 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB advises air passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketch
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it is raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris will be recalled, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To pave the way for the construction of the SGP, the state has called for a capital donation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to allocate a portion of the financial sum to its doubles on the markets.
Today, it has finally come to the first high bills.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly's Finance Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special opening tax and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is classified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganisation of the already existing corporate tax system: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to oversee this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This amount is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion, one is far away.
"It will be implemented that the tax resources will be added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion in capital dodation, which will be applied by the state and carried out gradually to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement said.
At SGP, you won’t find this system offensive at all.
“From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e., R.), you can cover the project for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion,” it explains.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which will be able to look for the 4 billion promised for a long time, is in danger of triggering a fairly moving parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Gentle Hackers and Emsy Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the mind of hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the series.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw nothing further than what one got to read over the course of months anyway in any x-ray (except for those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile of Stoffk<0xC3><0xBC>tt's already offered for their caricatured profile of seqdafis.
The rule according to which the secret files may consist only of known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the temples or the rose-cruisers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but also because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they already have.
This is also the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
So are the secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who considers only as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a waiver made about the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, this is what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have lost themselves, with the exception of a few regents.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it doesn’t happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of semblance and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-voluntary hacker can grasp the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is bearing the considerable blow against the prestige of the state-designate.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims less at risk than the "Scharfrichters".
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, all power could be bundled together like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where one can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the citizen’s rascal – can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free from secret, but it was secret to be secreted from the public sphere
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been added to such enormous power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future - that would be equivalent to a hanging glued to the street corner.
But it’s equally obvious that it’s up to the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could private and specific relationships be maintained only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds science fiction and romantic, but I see myself being forced to introduce the government agents to me, moving in a secret way on uncontrollable routes, having their messages written nowhere else than in mere memory, having the information they are carrying with them.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: in essence, Watergate’s espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by spooling from the back to the front and venturing all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, rather than from chapter to chapter.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the crossing.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France makes its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the fast-tracked financing promises (also called "fast start" or early funding) that have been realized by the developing countries.
And already the rough French beauticians have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right track to honour its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional bet has been made without being made to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen to set itself a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained, and will provide 150 million over three years of "fast-start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 were "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support from developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another, crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses his or her calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> as equivalent to 1 donated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Obviously, this is difficult to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to the emission containment, based on the most effective technology), it is fraudulent to present the euro, which is taken as an equivalent for a donated euro.
But France has nothing else in mind than the following: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by taking on 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany claims 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% committed to making donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
Nice hockey pokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France succeeds in believing that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then do not fully engage in negotiations, as they do not hesitate to do so.
The chapter of early funding is just a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of a drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its booking arrangements for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently debated topic): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the type of borrowing of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive with regard to the issues of dispute as it is with other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “accountability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise from the international confidence base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes on 81 different chemicals over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results “given the small number of samples analyzed do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustrative character of the problem treated”, had between July and September the usual within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child to a Paris meal consumed in superfoods plus superfoods.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were investigated as well as nascent labs looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disrupting factor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Center.
“Even if in the approaching totality of the cases the legal limits for any chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded, this survey is still very well understood that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor,” says Verdocrinis.
Already at breakfast alone, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same is true for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the b<0xC3><0xBC>chse, even the baguette and chewing gum were picked from pesticides and other chemicals.
In the conductive water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the "most abundant", and even the plastic dish used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The ultimate risk of this “harmful cocktail” for consumers “is likely to be underestimated,” according to the study.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
