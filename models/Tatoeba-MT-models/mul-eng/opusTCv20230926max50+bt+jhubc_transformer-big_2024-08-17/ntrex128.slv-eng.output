Members of the Valencian Assembly are concerned that they are “like Muppet”
Some members of the assembly were appalled at the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, or Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Vali<0xC5><0xBE>an.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are worried that they will laugh.
A member of the congregation of the species of laburists said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name is Roman with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means kakati.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed other options.
The Valiant Conservative said his group was “open-minded” about changing the name, while noting that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to introduce name changes, stated: ‘The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by the members themselves.’
The Welsh Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Parliament of Valija.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in the public consultation it received the most support from the ‘MWP’ option.
Members of the Assembly are apparently proposing other options, but reaching the consensus will be a difficult task for the Presidency, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a draft amending legislation within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of the members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on the legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
The Macedonian people will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
With the vote, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed her requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have faded as Harlem churches face problems
“The older people I talked to say they used to have bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one or the other today.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today.
At least they're no longer living rooms next door to where people regularly go."
However, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back to the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with shared administration (condominiums), where people will live who will not help shelter in the remaining neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites,” he said, “and that is why the day will come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by the Belgian religious community before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Belgian Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that performed worship nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors who did not want to hire or support the dark Ones on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Johnson's father's were planning a renovation, they ordered bells for the trench.
To honor David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin's Church, he proudly called bells "bells for poor people."
In July, the expert called them a little different: a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by the dark-haired musician, Dionysius A. Link, who left 18 years ago for the Riverside Church, where he bells on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin's Church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, there has been a complicated story with architects and contractors over the past few months; some have brought church laymen and others a bishop.
Zakristia – the administrative body of the parish, made up of lay people – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would “try to transfer costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about transparency on the part of the bishop.
Marine Dog Injured 13-Year-Old During Hunting for Whales in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting the lobster at the opening of the hunting season on the lobster.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then he and the group had sailed towards him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught a lobster, and then he found out that he was screaming “I was bitten!
He bites me!”
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
“I told everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a sea dog in the water!’” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer from the water, Dr. Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier a sea dog had been spotted in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
Those responsible for 48 hours prevented access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beautiful corners they have in the department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of entering the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, larger beauty boutiques will be tested in 11 stores per country, and next year in several stores if they succeed.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves that they previously used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty products offering to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique offering of cosmetic products, so most products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for smaller amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the discounts of Aldi and Lidl with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened Argos outlets in several hundred stores as well as Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales and takeovers have been more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to refurbish its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the merger ended after a dispute over the sharing of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in this plan, as it is expected to expand the range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty corners and improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained co-workers who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, an attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “crazy” about Holly Willoughby’s retirement from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job
The star broadcasts Dragons Day (Good Business) angry that television host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer in ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
The business pair company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This morning, 37, the show's host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has become the star of the show Dragons Day, as she recently retired from their lucrative business with a lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “crazy” when a golden girl on television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – she didn’t have enough time to dedicate herself to their charity.
The company compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted that it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truey, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source says: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, as the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlowe, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe the departure of the head of the show This Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in the UK, would have cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, as well as additional delays in opening.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple were on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of the comments, which some find "non-presidential", and a positive opinion about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, with his grinning “newspaper” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump described as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see the “appropriate response” of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead of this, the United States continues to carry out sanctions with which they continue to exert pressure.
Trump was a lot more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – they stopped testing missiles, helped free the hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in the conversation about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Cunami and Indonesia earthquake devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, they have not declared natural disasters, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” said Sumbunkova.
The organization Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palua and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given the fact that earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the fury of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built after the tsunami, but on other coasts this is not a common practice.
The loss of life was likely due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palua, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands even in the best of times is a challenge.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is docked in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, sails towards Paluj, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure ahead of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Jok’s administration in the re-election next year.
Yoko also faces the pressure of long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See also: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge set for late equalisation against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in the 89th minute from defeat to Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's bid 25 yards ahead of Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He turned the torch to his left and fired a shot at the remote door.
The shot was traveling high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner of the neck.
At the end of the day, the ball went through the gate of Kepe Arrizabalage and fell to the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much anymore and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with the touchdown of Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this action, the Blues forward handed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> with a fifth and entered Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly gave up in the middle and stepped forward.
Then he passed nicely through the defense, and Hazard ran into the penalty area.
Hazard took over the defense and fired his left leg at the remote gate through the Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
On Thursday at 3 p.m. in London, Chelsea are waiting for Videoton in the Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state-run disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that there were many people due to Friday's magnitude 7.5 earthquake that triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is littered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police have launched an investigation into the murder after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55am in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder.
Police are calling on anyone who has been in the area and has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I invite everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to come into contact with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage to get in touch with us as they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police representative confirmed the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime, who thought they knew the woman, and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police are informing the woman's parents.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one should enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told that it can take several hours before they can re-enter.
Police officers were told how he explained to the man that the entire area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one just outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and observed the apartment block.
All who have any information ask to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, indicating the diary 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s statue in parliament has become the latest target of controversy over “rewriting history”
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not order or execute.
Perhaps Cromwell will fall prey to the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, tells of a 19th-century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwella many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) see as the protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical discussions.
It is clear that the dispute in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements from the time when the Lord was a protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
A pig-killer freezes Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
The man, identified only by the name "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-out artery and covered with blood near a pig in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported Sunday to the South China Morning Post.
The swine fever is being prepared for swine vaccination at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin are expected to travel from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody sponge in the piggy bank.
Forensic research has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig froze the farmer to death.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” a sister named “Wu” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang arrived at the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were locked up so they wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pressed a Valiant farmer near the tractor, but the woman then drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “starter.”
“We would just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to show a lot of respect,” he said.
In the south-west of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa comes heavy rain
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa moves toward the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is weak.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday from 5.00 a.m. and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, an area of low air pressure is strengthened, moving east toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will mix with a low-pressure area, will create abundant precipitation in the coming days in a wider southwestern area.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of rainfall in some places will be about 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In southwestern parts, especially over most of Arizona, between 50 and 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very unthinkable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into torrents of rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust into the air.
A nearby low-pressure area will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfalls above 12 mm are possible, which can lead to a minor delay in flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region in the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday early in the morning, and late on Monday and Tuesday rainfall will spread.
Heavy rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will last Wednesday as well.
In the U.S., large temperature spikes may occur in October as the Arctic cools, while tropical areas remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this is caused by dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20 degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter hot October with temperatures around 27<0xC2><0xB0>C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, it could be 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More Than 20 Million People Have Mirrored Their Hearings by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people on six television networks have mirrored the interesting Thursday's testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that is believed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stance continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's last-minute turnaround: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had beaten her up in a guilty state and tried to take her down at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a blunt testimony that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday’s witness is expected to mirror more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average viewership of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that were performing testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For an easier performance, viewing is similar to playing a football match at the end or awarding a prize to the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is leading a full-day audition in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In the second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning, television cameras CNN and CBS recorded how protesters shouted at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend hearings.
During the play, for a few minutes, he took a look at what was captured live by the cameras of the television house CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee's hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if it was agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which was urged by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly convinced of this by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of ‘playing political games’ in Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the Sunday Times of criticizing her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said the proposal to Britain and the EU pay tariffs was another “completely absurd.”
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dytheon Simpson, Suspected of Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team.
According to a report from Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television complements the WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The security is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
A visitor from East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a previous report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful for the help in the investigation that led to the arrest, special units for the Louisiana State Police fugitives, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police and the residents of the area.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “care and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
Volcano ash storm in Mexico City
The ash, driven by the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano on Saturday as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center observed several instances of thunder and earthquake suns.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity in a volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, dubbed "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who supported independence clashed with anti-independence police units and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held by anti-graft police units, surrounded them with eggs and metal powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also clashes, with police having to use pendreks to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who cried “without forgetting, without forgiveness” for hours, faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media reports, 14 people were injured in the protests.
The year after the referendum on 1 October, which had been declared illegal in Madrid, Catalan separatists celebrated it, tensions in the independence-supporting region remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low, as opponents of the vote boycotted the elections to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region's elections.
Over the course of the night, independence-supporting groups camped in front of the electorate to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to clear the other way.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite significant, though close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence have made it difficult to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in opposition to a trial for their role in organising referendums and more recently.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the phone to protest in support of the police, explained that the protest had shocked politicians on both sides.
“Tensions are rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen with the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who got into the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly taking the car to a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at about 19.30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, they were supposed to shoot at the car with a sniper rifle.
Livingston won by 1-0 against Rangers with Mengaj
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingston secured a win
Livingston surprised Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a club coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengaj's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equalled the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team was left without a win in this year's championship, and Hearts, who leads the ladder next week, is behind them by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his unbeaten streak in the six-match division, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted a defeat.
Livingston squandered opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should lead well before the hit, as they have caused a number of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit it off the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The guests left the game Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests when interrupting the attack.
And in this way they also reached a key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengaj, who shot and shot from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had a larger possession of the ball, but the home defenses could not break and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos elicited Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman in the leg, and Lithgow shot out of the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
Templates continued to come to Livingston’s penal area, but the home refused all attacks, and the judge did not condemn two of Halkett’s offenses – a violation of Glenn Middleton’s replacement and a violation of the game by hand.
“Excellent performance” Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and result for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the layout have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be credited for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of junaks.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and had a well-organized defense while keeping Menga in the readiness of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
The Rangers were simply short of inspiration.
Although under Gerrard's leadership, they lack these standards.
There was a lack of shot at the goal – only once they successfully defeated the defending hosts – and it was a sort of wake-up call for the Rangers who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, the smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
The opinion was also expressed by several hundred protesters – many of whom are Kurds – who do not support Erdogan’s government and condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to greet him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the separation of visitors, which some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others despise as autocrats.
Accident on the road in Deptford: cyclist fatally crashes in car race
In London, the cyclist was fatally injured in a race in which a car was involved.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford to the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15pm British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescuers arrived, but the man died at the end of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the cyclist died in the race, during which the driver of the car fled, namely on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
Police have made a statement that the police are verifying the identity of the man so that they can inform their relatives.
They built roadblocks and diverted bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Witnesses Injured in Kidnapping
Six prison guards were injured in the incident in a strictly guarded male prison, according to a statement from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. after British summer time and is still ongoing.
Police officers from the “Tornado” unit were called to take care of the ambush, in which eight prisoners are involved and are limited to one wing.
Smaller injuries to the face were sustained at the end of the day.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called a specially trained staff who will take care of the exit from the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the crew were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and will probably be further behind bars as a result.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the warden was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, they called an anti-aircraft police unit to the prison to intervene in a serious incident in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to get angry at Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is an angry good 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, between 25 and 50 mm of precipitation is expected, individual precipitations up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden floods, Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the dry season is currently taking place in the south-west.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, a good 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punte Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with the colder waters of the Pacific, and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonor we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with the possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” the weather.com website reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the abundant rain on the Baja California Peninsula in the northwest Sonora and in the American Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rainfalls can lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in mountain ranges.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found on the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 p.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are calling everyone who may have caught the incident with a mobile phone to call.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffering the hostility and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and unheard-of tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffering the hostility and anger” of the Democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexually assaulting her decades ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, she also spoke to Ford about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality, and courage” that day.
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' electoral participation in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m really looking forward to the candidacy,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says the Democrats are on a mission of “resilience and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims is increasing.
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, many of them carrying giant waves that were sinking along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Pal, when six-metre waves struck the coast in the dark, killing many and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
“When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it all fell to the ground,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Paluj.
Photographs from the air, published by the accident agency, show destroyed buildings and shops, winding and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storm surges continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes were felt.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300 km north of Paluja, in the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, the communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Donggala area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of issuing the warnings.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor of the screams alerted people on the street to the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took with it buildings and cars.
At Reuters, they couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an electrical outage that disrupted communications around Palua, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the army has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The city’s airport was open only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Paluja on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr Dosseb, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the yard in front of their premises set up a shelter from the riots, but saw many scenes of desertion along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience would not be allowed to come to Pal in the first place.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, cross-border funding, stocks and staff assistance are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national accident site.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still treated as an accident at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national accident’, we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palua, friends and relatives of the missing are shrouded in hope that their near-miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days and lay next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other, trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, was, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an elder in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, in the hours when news of the cancellation of the Roa Roa hotel was circulating around the community of sailing parachutes, he was desperate to send messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Paluj who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray cliche, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Tattoos Steal $26,750 While Charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee Center
According to Newport police, on Friday morning, the dads stole $26,750 from Brink’s security guard, who filled a ATM in the center of Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement to the public.
While he was employed, another man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses were seen fleeing several suspects from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “Being by the official name of Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano Grande, who canceled the performance for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is abbreviated to his current professional name, but West has also said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you and I am all of you.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” I have transformed into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are.”
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without it and with big letters.
Mexican President Amlo has promised he will not use the army against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, just as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use troops to suppress the Mexican people.”
By the time the left-wing student movement began to operate in Latin America, at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly grants to students and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersile Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) this month published the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most profitable ventures in China.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American player in the Othello game, and later became executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as a robotics competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“China is not the one that takes over the best academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have employed the best with the university to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the United States step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese state council issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poorer, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a tight committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) in Artificial Intelligence Research currently invests more than $100 million a year
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
At the referendum, the Macedonian people will decide to change the name of the country.
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", thereby resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 percent as much as necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price, which is worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, is one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote that will be decided.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reported irregularities until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjosa Tanevski, a voter from Skopje’s capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko delivered their votes in the Macedonia referendum on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small ode and set the chairs in front of the tents, which were set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
President Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after issuing his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be “confirming our future”.
The poll, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of those polled would vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voting must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy that took office in May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City overplayed Brighton's entire defence and ambush
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the file in the middle of the pitch.
He ran among the three Brighton defensive players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He overplayed one defensive player and was faster than the others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguera, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with leg problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues the blues an early advantage in the first English league doubles.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's half.
He gave the shot to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the remote gate.
An assailant from the blues's son threw the ball into the net just before it flew out of the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their title opportunities
The Nationals team dropped out of the finish line, so there's no particular reason for the new attack.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final, as they have the West League match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but are still waiting for their first title in the division.
“While we can’t get anything, we will at least be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a large crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
Nationals have not yet announced the names of the first metal for Sunday, but in this case it is likely to be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for 34 years, is on Thursday metal as a tireless player and would have enough days off by Sunday.
Washington's right-back this season collected 18 wins and 7 losses with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at assemblies in West Virginia
The president directly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It will be one of the biggest – I’m really working on the candidacy, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening now too.
They are determined to take power again, using all possible means. You can see irresponsibility, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to bribe to get power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but we’re not going to give them that.”
According to him, the democrats are on a mission of “resilience and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “horrible, mean, low-key, and false.”
A prominent member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, was highlighted, and the audience heard a loud disapproval.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. That was a really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinions, she is impatient.
When a Momentum activist in my local client told me that I was not a believer, it wasn’t even a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who are unwilling to express their opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has done the same thing since she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a non-confidential proposal for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, concerning which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In an announcement for Friday's meeting of the Labour party Nottingham East wrote that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years I was a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, most meetings do not use such a tone, and the promise of a “friendly and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It is increasingly obvious that different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and it is assessed in every opinion whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, and my colleagues, whom I had previously thought were sharing similar political views, were expecting me to change my opinion and take positions that I would never agree with, whether it was in the area of national unity or security.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – the criticisms on social networks that call for non-elections are condemning the politics of the environment and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet every day with a flood of sexist or racist tormentors, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how the rates of abuse have become something quite ordinary.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every suggestion of distrust or a change in the rules for the choice of the party becomes more scrupulous.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to bow my head and not be so loud, but it will be “all right” with me.
But I didn’t get into politics because of that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally led to my primary school’s cancellation – I, as a local minister or government minister, tried to advocate for better public services for those who needed them the most.
I have never hidden my political convictions, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to spend time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is sailing against Brexit that will affect the households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political aptitude will displease me the best of all.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unprejudiced Ayr at the top of the stairs
Two familiar attempts somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully fun championship game of the day.
They're now at the top of the ladder and they're the only unbeatable team out of ten.
In the end, the weightlifter on the home page translated their top defense and better exploitation of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“In our previous games, we have done a lot of testing and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ayr’s team, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did.”
The 14th-minute hit by Grant Anderson, which was converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who received it in a game with the Warriors, meant a numerical advantage for Melrose and Jason Baggott scored an unbeaten try.
Climo at the break increased the lead for Ayr before he hit right at half time and then converted an independent try for the result 17:5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious injury to Ruaridha Knott, who was carried on the stretchers, and then Ayr progressed with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who was transformed by Climo.
Temporary captain Ayr Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card, and Melrose re-used the game with the player more with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of violent pressure.
But the hosts came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to the obstruction of Clima without the ball, MacPherson was hit in the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent the winger Gregor Henry in the fifth try of the hosts.
Star of the series Still Game begins a new career in hospitality
Still Game star Ford Kieran is apparently going to a restaurant, at least to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season it would be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the stories, but a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
In public buildings, the navy blue flags are displayed.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a renewed voyage through the Pacific.
This hope is perhaps the greatest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the international court, which it will receive after five years of consultations on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the international court on large screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of inexhaustible talks, Chile must negotiate access to the sea.
Here’s Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is expected to face a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it wouldn’t change much.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia, and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years are not talking in favor of Bolivia, but they may cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>ratej said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has smothered all the good will that may have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, used the maritime issue as a political deterrent.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri had a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States has called for the fulfillment of its promises made at a meeting between leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of the resumption of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong if it thinks that the continuation of sanctions and the treaty predicting the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to confirm the prediction without Pyongyang first taking decisive action on disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the weapons that the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
At fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge covers that come in stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to supplement your collection of covers or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to look ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a collection of bizarre oversized covers in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion runway that blinded the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractically covered this summer, they flooded Instagram, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentinov's piece, which stood out the most, was a beige-coloured hat with wide bristles decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included gemstone shells, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but your head won’t heat up.
Thom Browne has also shown a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter’s masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to the equipment for diving with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with a frozen ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashionable connoisseurs predict that giant blankets will come into stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow "La Bombi", a straw hat with 60-centimeter bristles was observed on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski among others.
The iconic brand for the extremely impractical hat that flooded the social networks sent another big creation on the fashion runway – a strawberry beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
A bag made of raffia in a burnt orange color, lined with raffia stripes and a handle made of white leather, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus designer for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores for the next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for extras would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy the fame of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding results on exams further bolstered by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as a global citizen.
As a sector of education that can shape and implement a customized school program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation will impress his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, the words are imprinted in his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely only on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest levels of achievement in independent schools.
68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language achieved an excellent score.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved an excellent grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students received an excellent grade in German, 69 percent received an excellent grade in French, and 63 percent in French.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as optional subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of physics, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that, for the reasons why employers are struggling to fill their vacancies, 17 per cent of the job losses are attributable to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
In the future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If one learns another language, no matter the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose from a number of languages taught by experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's inaugural pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers official Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my preparation career, I don’t need a pre-season game,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of rallies in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned meetings next week, including stops in his favoured countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his candidate for a free seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after a November vote.
What time will Trump’s rally in West Virginia and where will he be able to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why confirmation in the Senate is expected to be delayed for one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who are waiting for important elections in November, gain a new impetus.
That’s why in President Trump’s campaign these five meetings were aimed at “promoting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“The congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the tough campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he earned more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s a bad sign that the president needs to come and “lift him up” in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still has a desire to win and retains hope before Sunday's individual duels
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's duels of two doubles (foursomes) may have been what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The missing swing is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So, where's the tipping point now?
“They had six points of advantage and now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, because it leads by four points, and twelve more can get them.
But Americans feel, according to Spieth, that they have the wind in their sails, among other things, they were encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial hit to the green and gives a good example.
The shouts of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and I were equalised in the fourth game after a two-point loss.
The punch that brought them victory at the 15th hole, accompanied by a similar shout, one that you know they believe the American team still has options.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 Holes to Slavery.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Unusual, but charming, the two of Europe have won four points out of four and are invincible.
The two "Molliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit a bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the noisy audience, confirm the fact that those are the players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could have better sealed the possible victories of Europe than the Fleetlowood Son of Mori.
And possibly both at the same time in different places.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Because of the bugs and two double bugs in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden have fallen into a crisis from which they have not found a way out.
On Saturday, the players won’t be able to help.
Games with four balls and a pair of doubles are an interesting exception to follow closely due to the communication between the pairs, the tips they give, the tips they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a lot of advantage over the last day, but the two sides have shown that the U.S. team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the U.S. side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is heading to the final day of Ryder Cup with a good lead after Saturday’s four-ball and two-doubles match with 10:6 against the US.
The excellent pair, composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, scored four points with two wins over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had a four-ball victory over the American team she missed and led the series 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in the two-match doubles, where they won two games, but they were unable to make up for the deficit.
The team of Jim Fury needs eight points from the weekly 12 individual doubles if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European journalist to win four consecutive points, while Molinari (a pair called "Molliwood") and the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then turned out again and even more convincingly defeated spent Woods and American newsman Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a moment, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball doubles and two-double doubles, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning game with four balls, returned for a two-game doubles and in a pair with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked first and third on the world rankings.
But a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris didn’t all go according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
With 2 and 1 they won decisively against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two doubles, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup did the team return after a four-point lag before individual duels, although Fury's team needed only equalization to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, the Sunday antidote may seem too big for her.
North Korea: “Without trust, we will not unilaterally disarm”
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing distrust in the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Body, Ri Jong Ho said North Korea had taken a number of "significant measures in good faith" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining nuclear sites, and detonating nuclear weapons tests.
“However, we do not see the appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be convinced of state security and under such conditions, we will not unilaterally arm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, as part of which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement was significant because it was not an immediate breakthrough.
Ri joined the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader, which took place on June 12 in Singapore. At that time, Kim pledged to pursue a “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, the colossal divide between the Trumps.”
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give up on the call to release the strict international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we must first denuclearize, and that pressure is being exerted by sanctions to achieve its goals by force, and even oppose the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The thought that sanctions could put us on our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued implementation of the sanctions further deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted at the U.N. assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jee-in, which have taken place over the past five months, and added: “If we were to talk about nuclear disarmament issues with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear fission would collapse.
However, the tone of the speech was quite different from that year when the United Nations General Assembly said the attack on the continental United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump called Kim the “missile man” alone.
This year, Trump, who threatened last year to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he was still waiting for much work and that sanctions must remain in place until the North is dissolved.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no timeframe for this, saying: “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue resolutely without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not ended well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea had criticized him in a matter of hours, calling his demands “gangsteric.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to undermine the missile test station and the infrastructure for nuclear testing if the United States takes “appropriate action” to do so.
Mr. Munu was supposed to tell Mr. Kim that the "appropriate measures" meant the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest.
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is for all undergraduate students to learn how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing masculinity culture of “full-time” learning, where the power is accumulated with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students of the best universities in the world often don't know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course that was his first of its kind in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I only learn this now that I’m in the last year?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that it surprised her.
The course, which is being conducted for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says they decided to take such a course when they found that during the week, students significantly lack sleep.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive assignments.
In one section is a picture of the door of the student house where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports blankets and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants found that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to be aware of these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in “surviving all-night learning” is still present. He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, as a result of which lack of sleep, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of high-quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brains, due to lack of sleep, go into the mode of hunger, gain weight.
A 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler shape the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professors’ lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to take a course throughout the student settlement.
It is hoped that in the next stage of the postgraduate student will be able to request that they complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as an alarm clock. He also wants to alert them to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalances in circadian rhythm.
Livingston : Rangers <0x3D> 1 : 0 Menga with a sledgehammer flooded Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in a guest appearance: Dolly Menga in Livingston, Steven Gerrard's announced team sentenced to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team has been chasing their first guest win after a February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4:1, but Gary Holt's team has beaten her second in 18 games since leading Gerrard's team, leaving his team to lead the Scottish League behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected Rangers didn't give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to the regular spot and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the goal difference the Hibernian team was left behind.
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when an object from the fans' visiting team arrived in the city after reporting it.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team, which easily defeated Ayr and qualified for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, held on to Livingston’s verified entourage, which took the Hearts point a week earlier, and was undoubtedly impressed with how his runaway team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first brief giveaway, the latter then went on to Allan McGregor's goal, but the whistle at the performance was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free shot was then scored by Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defensive aide Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the race with Steven Lawless, a penalty shootout would have to be awarded after 15 minutes of the match, but Judge Steven Thomson's request for a Colombian caught fire.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots in the first half, but not the head shot sent by Lassana Coulibaly against the goal, nor the batsman Ovie Ejari did not pose any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already well deserved due to his persistence.
Rangers failed to pay for another Jacobs sequel with a long release.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Meng's file for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during Coulibaly's break, replaced him with winger Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be morelos, but Kelly effectively escaped from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett making more appearances before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was undecided.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shootout at the end of the match after contact with Jacobs, but was not recognized by Judge Thomson.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our weekly editions: September 30, 1882, that is, to this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, which later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention being the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
It has become a staple in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play a cowboy scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's counter. It's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can really hear the effect that radioactivity has on atoms in the materials.
Evans: “Madonna, they’re really advertising now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention of his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attacking cells
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to recognize attacking cells and destroy them
The vaccine, as part of therapy, teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves the acquisition of the patient's immune cells, which are then changed in the laboratory
After this, they can "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, the immune system learned to recognize attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells that are converted into a laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then injecting it again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer.
A similar approach to the acquisition of immune cells of patients who are “teaching” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after performing at the SNL, made a counter-trump point with the inscription MAGA on the drop.
The audience was not excited.
Kanye West was taped in Saturday Night Live’s studio for a weird spot, during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would race for the presidency in 2020.
At the end of the performance with his third song, "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap with "Make America Great Again", West began an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
"Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have to move out of America a long time ago," he said.
This year’s SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor dived from Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The recording of West's monologue was not performed, and it was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was going to go crazy with this.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems with the writing on the drops.
“They came to me for a while.
They said to me, ‘Do not walk in the way of your own head.’
I've been charged!
But they say I'm lost," the Washington Examiner said in a statement.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see a lost scene?” and added that he had to come up with “Superman’s taunt, because it means no one can tell me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments were prepared by the audience at least twice to whistle, and the SNL team members were in obvious jeopardy, and someone said to Vanity: “There was a death silence in the studio.”
Westa was recently invited to a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West was already surprised by the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore Perrier's bottle of mineral water costume.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of TPUSA’s conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU for getting up to Heaven.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s just fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
“Me too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and will now be "a battle formally known as Kanye West. Now I'm YE."
He is not the first musician to decide to change his name, but he has already done so by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we can’t forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, then became an Artist, once known as Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington has made a sharp appearance against toxic manhood
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's thrilling medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old, who has sharply condemned the stereotype of a masculinity hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can only earn respect with persistence.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that something was going wrong in his opinion, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old co-star from the Rose Leslie Game of Thrones, admitted he has strong convictions about the subject.
“I’m currently seriously wondering where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What did we teach men about the problems we are now facing as adults?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to the display of very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose exactly this particular salary for men?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change that?
“There was obviously something wrong with the young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the recording of any prediction or continuation of the Game of Thrones, because he “concluded with the fighters and horses”.
Kit will play the lead role of the new show True West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother-in-law.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened due to the Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love choice of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, the HIV virus has spread rapidly due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost nothing.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 a year.
The transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse is a very common problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is still very much present.
Because conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men, according to the results of the research, eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff have released information about Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had published information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that these allegations come from individuals and websites of the far-right.
"Lies, lies, and even more unforgivable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information released after the allegations includes the home address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha from the state of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators ended up hearing Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that through the IP address it is possible to identify a source of the publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office and conclude that the information was published by someone from the staff, Hill reports.
“These baseless accusations are completely false and pure lies,” Waters continues.
“My employees, whose identities, personal data and security are endangered by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for leaking this data.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters' statement quickly came across criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial the branch of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they haven't done, you can't show anger.
You can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters's response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for the city of Waters in the midterm elections, announced on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Watersova said in a statement that her cabinet had notified “the relevant institutions and prosecution bodies in connection with these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for hints of Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first appeared on screen in 2003 under the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satire on how we're denied a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with excited eyes and unusual grimaces acquires permission to remix the comic book; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It is a rogue secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, the young Mr. Bean, and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note to the song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery novel that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten television commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, he was wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly touched his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems a little mild and overly unnecessary, especially since “real” films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without bad news.
It seems that the humor is aimed at children and not so much adult viewers, which is why Johnny English’s repulsive adventures are not as innovative and focused as the Atkinsons do not jump in the role of Mr. Bean.
The constant theme is now obvious that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the network of Britain’s most secretive agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the breaking point for the premiere, a pompous figure who has already suffered a break due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has struggled with the role of the alleged Terese May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that could help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been revealed, so she must choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school, who informally teaches how to work under the cover: here the writers hit, because English performs some sort of spying “rock academy”.
They take England to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where they meet with a longtime collaborator, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is barely lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more problems in the name of the secret service of her Highness, while meeting the Fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: this is the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed in a waiter-infested fire in a French restaurant, creates chaos when they are overheated on the roof of a Volt yacht, and when English tries to use the glasses for an apparent reality to get acquainted with the interior of the Volt's house, they fall asleep.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and vigour it reminds of a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help myself here, and I think: is the British film Atkinson able to give a role that actually justifies his talent?
The Labours deny that they are planning a four-day work week for the British, with a five-day work week payment.
Labour party Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a paycheck for five days.
A client of business leaders wants the savings that companies create as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to flow to workers and allow them an extra day off.
That way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits the party’s economic plan and the plan to put the state on the side of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of a changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal we will strive to achieve with a client’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported a four-week working week in its campaign in the 2017 general election.
This goal is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-week work week is not a party policy and the party does not think about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power out of the “responsible directors” and “winners” in municipal enterprises.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in the management companies may not be able to regain the full share, as the Labour Party could impose “deductions” on the basis of alleged offences.
It also confirmed plans to include workers on the board of directors and the introduction of the Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed in a 60-minute show whether their opinion could be changed by the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation.
An investigation into the indictment against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of the office of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his resignation.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the reporter for the 60-minute show asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing began, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when the charge came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’”
He was determined, unflinching, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice appears to have been carved into stone.
“I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an extremely compelling reason for his change,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And this was not confirmed by any of the men whom he had appointed.”
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) and did it contribute in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event featuring a truly extraordinary variety of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. They will occupy the Great Tragedy of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event.
The Global Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Citizens’ Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a variety of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call or any other meaningful way to increase their chances of getting a haircut.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to ask for action, or is this just another example of so-called “clitivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on a situation by signing an online petition or mediation?
According to the Global Citizen movement, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters have been recorded since 2011 in pursuit of a range of different goals.
He says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the fruit of its actions would be 390 pledges and messages, on the basis of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” which Rwandans promised $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after they received more than four dozen hostages.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social blame for malnutrition in the historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Food Power Partnership, told crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, after more than 5,000 actions that the UK has called for improving the diet of mothers and children, has announced that it will co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with dietary measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a navy to “block” Russian energy exports – U.S. Department of the Interior
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke reportedly said that Washington could use the navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke said Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of legitimate governments) was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is being marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
In the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy makes sure that our maritime routes are open and blocks them if necessary, thus preventing Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is hailed as the “Voice of Energy Consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less impact on fuels and their replacement,” he said, referring to Russia as “a pony who knows one trick,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is supposed to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas project, which is believed to be the “tanker” of Moscow after Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 is worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for the implementation of pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany has rejected the U.S. position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Making a third country into our energy supply is a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘explore’ her candidacy for U.S. president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “explore” her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
At a townhouse in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman leader,” said The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully study my candidacy for president.”
Warren’s meeting in the city hall was to persuade President Donald Trump to “lead this country in the wrong direction.”
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I'm terribly concerned about," she said.
Warren has repeatedly openly criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
The poll, which was released on Thursday, showed that most of its own voters believe Warren should not be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/Boston Globe, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters.
Twenty-three per cent of them would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that she has greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of respondents being expected to support it, and 48% being expected to oppose it.
Other high-profile Democrats who would be eligible for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to an Associated Press report, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“When my own son goes through what he experiences after his return, he connects me with other families who are facing post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son’s arrest as “the elephant in the saloon” and said her son and other military veterans were returning slightly altered, confused, wondering where the respect for what fellow soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military gave to the state was.
Tracka Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of weapons in a state of guilt, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of the new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Columbia support the legal rejection of a new U.S. policy that denies the right to asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the said district filled a court case on Friday to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang” had abused her, but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the federal states that support Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications come to the United States, as countries that are constantly facing problems with the heat and violence in the family.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy annulled the decision of the Committee on Immigrants’ Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court said.
Prosecutors further stated in the request that the policy, which denies immigrants the right to enter, harms the American economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour force”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylums to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum has never been thought of solving all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palua has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her hot boyfriend in an evacuation center in the divided town of Pal.
“The rescuers are constantly carrying bodies.
There is no clean water.”
It was seemingly urban, returning to destroyed homes that had been swept through the swampy stuff and tried to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, were resting outside a military hospital in Paluja, where patients were treated outside due to constant heavy aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I've been pushed against the ruinous walls," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Oversight’ With ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after the publication of a four-page ad in an official Chinese newspaper in the U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China, Beijing, accused the abuse of U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have accused Trump of trying to meddle in the U.S. federal election, describing it as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange strikes by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are said to affect exporters in federal states such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic path, as the municipality is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not specify which ones.
Republicans Lose Voters Before Midterm Elections With Breakdown With Kavanaugh, Analysts Warn
Analysts note that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and advocate for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh despite several allegations of sexual assault will be known to come in the upcoming midterm elections by losing the election.
The sentiments here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that the pressure from Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI at the last minute will be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the MoveOn group, on Friday, according to a report from an official in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallway when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a journalist reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will transcend all boundaries,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already strong, and they keep it.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undecided local voters and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, a former Republican National Council president, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the world vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s arrest; it’s also about how Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Democratic-backed Priority Group, told the television channel.
Americans seem to be somewhat divided between this, or more likely to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more of them supporting the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe or believe Ford’s testimony the most, and 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh the most.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying while testifying, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Council under oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a state of guilt.
Ramirez claims that she was sexually assaulted by a Supreme Court candidate when they were together at a party during their study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world’s web plans to launch a new internet to battle with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world’s web, opens a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners’ solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta’s purpose was to “take over the world.”
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a “personal storage storage” or POD.
This may include contact information, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of the personal data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
This is what the company calls “personal data empowerment”.
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of the company is to bring together resources, processes and relevant skills that will enable access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and the group “are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could eliminate all their business models overnight.”
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday post on Medium that Inrupt’s purpose is “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Feast of the Carrier of the Victoria Cross from World War I
For over 100 years, in their hometown, they have been celebrating the dedication of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the Church of England who acquired it as a fighter in the First World War.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the Colonel's grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s act, with which he earned the distinction.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel of St. Quintin "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he plotted against the line of fire, and with “the greatest heroism” he led the line forward, and then I attacked the machine and hit three members of the detachment.
On October 4, 2018, only a good month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so humility teaches me.”
With their brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he feels “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and “that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give.”
Fans of mixed martial arts spent the whole night watching Bellator 206, and instead they were interested in Puja Pepe.
Imagine: All night long you’ve been shakin’ to watch the fully sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The event in San Jose featured 13 doubles, including six in the main park, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were puzzled to find that the broadcast had been replaced by a play by Pussy Pepe.
He wasn't very excited, because he stayed up until the morning just because of the duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "some kind of painful joke".
“According to the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Pujsa Pepa. Yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the UK would also be involved in the future.
“When I think about re-playing, I think I could do it,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t fix it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of messages exchanged during the switch and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the case; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of the six, we will be carrying five doubles – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than expectations and we counted on that.
This is a very invaluable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “minor” about sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to anyone because of his sexual orientation – but that gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that “not everyone” was as self-conscious as he entered high school.
During a talk on the first show Desert Island Discs, conducted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “confidence.”
He also said that by the time he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics had diminished.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, was absent due to a multi-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as a stranger on Laverne’s first show, said he felt “less valuable” than everyone else, as “it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the actual thing that gives me strength and persistence to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his direction.
A two-time bronze Olympic champion has become an influential advocate of LGBT rights and has appeared twice this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “confidence.”
The three-time world champion said the romance with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but says the difference in years has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said at the age of 14 and his father died three years later, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.”
The couple adopted their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley says it changed his "whole outlook".
“If you asked me last year, all I have to say is, ‘I have to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you're not going to be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he wasn’t vulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I’d dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympics in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – the Proud Musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and who still caressed his skin.
Desert Island Discs air on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 a.m. (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson transferred to the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to return to form again so that this will not become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event for a record-breaking 12-seater, left Captain Furyk to sit on Saturday's quads.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was so common for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what he was aiming for.
Given that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the straightest, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow pitch of Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes missed punches.
And if only the playoffs weren’t scary enough, Mickelson will have a fix with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari Cup in Sunday’s ninth game, which he’s linked to rookie Tommy Fleetwood in a jump to win in all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have at the beginning 12 games of the individual four games less, started well, Mickelson’s match could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he did not say much.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he was scratching my back and hugging me with his hand and saying he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in you.
He is one of the famous and has contributed tremendously to the teams in the past and also this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought it had to be done that way.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson is set to break Nick Falda’s record for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which has never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence on the team also brings some inconceivable benefits.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, witty, he likes to be crazy about people and it’s great to have him in a team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they moved in with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be achieved
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage at the start of the last day of the individual games in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
Young Danec made his debut in 1997 at a race in Valderram, where the side, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and crossed the goal with a hair-only lead, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t forget that we had a lot of advantage in Valderra; we had a lot of advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderra where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (pictured) after looking at the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and 10 in the Gulf of Mexico and led by National.
So history shows me and everyone in the team that the cup is not over yet.
Play it full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game's not over until it's written on the board.
We aim to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He says all the time that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about the game of his players on a challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never have rushed here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be in front of the individual's game, so this will have to be tackled differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players: Tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had already been on both sides of the transition in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every passing word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, told his players on the final day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this drive gets endurance, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We created the right setting and put the boys in a way that we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and fight with Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“With this group of guys, I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said of the individual selection.
The new German warship has been rescheduled.
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but due to system failure and rapidly rising costs will not be until at least next year, local municipalities have reported.
The handover of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuertemberg, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the official Die Zeit, citing the military representative.
The vessel is expected to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is fraught with worrying post-delivery issues.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the aging Fregat class of the Bremen class.
It is expected to have a strong top, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft fires, and some cover-up technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates should be able to stay outside the home port for up to two years.
However, the continuous delays mean that the top warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to exert their influence overseas, will become obsolete by the time of the start of use, says Officer Die Ziet.
Last year, the F125 frigate appeared on the headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons for the return, and German municipalities have cited a number of key “program and technical flaws” that would make warships useless if sent to a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were especially important, as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's possibilities for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz ship is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem – including the training of the crew.
This is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that maritime power is decreasing in Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "deprived of ships suitable for navigation."
The official said that the issue had become more acute over time because the old ships had been dismantled and the replacement ships had not been secured.
He regretted that no ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out at the Scottish Highlands estate, in which they are trying to find out how bats use food to hunt for food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and capture brown bats and peripheral bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key points of the estate, they will set up special recorders to monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what types of things they do.
Then they will prepare a Habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for nettles and other related species.
The number of populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
There is also a risk of wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Non-smokers aren't really blind.
Due to their nocturnal hunting habits, they help themselves more with hunting prey with their ears than with their eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles along the way, the sophisticated technique of echolocation is used.
NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, asylum checks, and occasional rescues.
The organisation, owned by Threada in the Dumfries and Galloway area, has even established the first and now the only Scottish reserve specifically dedicated to bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have a great area for bats on Threavu,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a lot to know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before performing maintenance work on the holdings, as the possible accidental destruction of a single bat nursery can cause the death of up to 400 females and juveniles, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Non-smokers are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Fund for the Conservation of Non-Poverty, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations behave.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges and Lawyers Prepare for the German Journal’s Trial
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus accused him of raping an American named Kathryn Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 for the silence about the event.
At a rally of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, described the report as "fake news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the player added with a smile.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine for what they called an “unacceptable reporting of private life suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “unproperty damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was supposed to return to the player's room after meeting Mayor and Ronald at the nightclub, where she was allegedly raped by an anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her that he is “99 percent a good man” who only disappoints in “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but he described it as a contractual one.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, and that she later agreed to extrajudicial settlement because she was "terriblely afraid of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement, as she continues to suffer severe trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before the transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus, after a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘would forever regret’ the loss of car manufacturers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
“The UK would forever regret losing its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit,” said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "terrifying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that the UK's exit from the EU without a deal would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Concerns about how exiting the European Union without an agreement will affect cross-border trade have also been raised by other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main considerations relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the ‘right time’ principle, with parts of UK and EU car suppliers arriving every 37 minutes on order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at the borders, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota could not store more than one day of parts at its Derbyshire plant, the company’s representatives said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Therese May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly tailored to avoid such border checks.”
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be absolutely capable of continuing a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been halted, but in the long run it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the founder of Unite’s factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job will never come back.”
The government representative said: “We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, the White House says
A major meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “stopped for another week” due to the ongoing fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and potentially the president’s confirmation of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will forgive the attorney general’s envoy and threaten Mueller’s independence has fuelled Washington’s rhetoric for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a hearing aid to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that he was planning to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said Rosenstein would not have been fired, and the meeting was then moved to avoid a conflict by hearing a Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set. It could happen this week, given everything else going on in the Supreme Court, but it could be postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to make sure you’re informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with reporters since September 10th, and that's what some reporters would argue.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not to be attributed to the resistance to “setting up” TV reporters, but she said: “I could not deny that they were setting up.”
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without mentioning the source: “We looked at the numbers.”
Meetings will still be held,” Sanders said. “But if the journalists of the President of the United States can directly address their question, this is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We try to do this as much as possible and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have at your disposal a conference at which you can speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with state-run guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared involuntarily and partly bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and the desire to continue the work even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of the application for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, as the decision came to a close this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible scenario of a no-deal exit.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie, after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, has stopped an emergency operation, reported Mike Organ from The Tennesseean magazine.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the edge of the playground and kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the playground before they put him on the stretcher and took him off the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details on the type/size of the injury are not yet known” and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a janitor at the University of Tennessee, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since moving from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five strokes before leaving the game, bringing his total number of strokes in the season to 18 strokes.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Tories.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Increased cork will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year and allocate it to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of coke when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and the collected money will be spent on the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and increase the taxation of high-income people.
The increased cork will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will encourage the government’s efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The premium — which will be charged in addition to the current cork, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for broadcasting — could amount to no less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-citizens of the United Kingdom would purchase 13 percent of newly built London real estate, which would result in an increase in prices and a harder purchase of the first property.
Many of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in cork to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Large construction companies have accused the price hikes by looting the land that they do not actually use, and Mayevo has called for leaving quotas for affordable housing to fix the British "residential embarrassment."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including monitoring of rents and ending forced evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give the city council greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the repair of our non-working housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life.
It cannot be right, however, that for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, buying a home is as simple as for British citizens in garages.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to run the club Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" was to become the manager of the Scottish club.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently occupies third place in the Premier League, with three points less than the top tier.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I received a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only have this opportunity if I had succeeded in leading the club.”
Ross' predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic team head, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor to such big names he did not feel fear.
“Success is measured to me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
"The road to that is not easy, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross only works as a manager for three years after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped to prevent a third league breakout, and St Mirren took the edge of the breakout to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” he recalled taking Alloe.
“I was really sure that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was a good player, so I had a pretty good time, and I also achieved some great success.
But the game can become difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run a club and I’m doing it now. I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life now.”

Summer heat has increased the revenue of hard-to-break British pubs, but pressure has also increased on the chain of restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business adviser, said: “England’s sustained sunshine and participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when the decline in revenue from the 2nd half came to an end.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June was even higher in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased in comparison to each other more than traffic in restaurants decreased.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs that primarily offer food have also decreased, but not as dramatically as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent in one month, and food sales decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman, of RSM’s group of leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When selling on the hospitality market, the greatest factor of the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although the fall of 4.8 percent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
For the owners of restaurants with a long hot summer could not come at the wrong time and only time will tell if the need for recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 per cent in July, indicating a slowdown in the introduction of brands.

One in five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have a secret social network account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News reinforces fears about the publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that is intended for parents.
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – create an account on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has reinforced fears about the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a censored “main” account that they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page, noticed that her daughter was urging visitors to rape her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create a website where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete on the field and outdoors and President Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those who are directing the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community. We are confident that the Scottish athlete would make a huge profit by being included on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope to be able to really contribute and help in leading the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who has won a total of four Olympic medals in the run of 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I practice agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mother to cows, shared online opinions
The company that manufactures breast pumps has shared opinions with an ad that compares the mother to cows in the swamp.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump” marketing, consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show the mother all the freedom the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a hay-filled barn on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I draw, but I don’t see any tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not my breasts, it’s my breasts.”
Zbor<0xC4><0x8D>ek continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the baby, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was published on the Facebook company’s website, caused considerable inconvenience on the web.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying they were joking about the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
“Like me, they also get pregnant and are forced to produce milk, but their children are stolen from them in the first days after they are weaned,” she wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both mother and youngster.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “Voice completely without feeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that the song “for the church was funny.”
“It seems like a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it if I still had it.
When I was growing up, I felt just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I understood it the way it was supposed to be.
“It’s a great product,” the other wrote.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that targets mothers who are milking themselves (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an advertisement that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the blue.
The concept of action is that many women who suck their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and discreetly fits into the nipple for breastfeeding, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even activity outdoors while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mater, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the progression of the parallel between women who are sucking milk, and cows milking we wanted to put in the spotlight the pumping of milk and all its challenges, while in a fun way that women can connect, show an incredible feeling of freedom through which the new cow will be able to drink.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump came on the cover.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the mannequin trail walked for designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of Migrants Quietly Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be handed over to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to risk their own chances of remaining in the country by asking for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of the households would have to issue fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested more than a dozen people who had asked for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punished foreigners.
That’s why we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers at the detention centre said.
Many will show up with a video conferencing call and not personally to defend themselves in front of the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to the statements of workers in shelters and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater at larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where signs of a child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without having to emotionally prepare them for it or give them the opportunity to talk from friends, can complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and that they would “act accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, “almost finished.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on its territory in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced the refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“In a political issue, they are changing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have assured Syria that it will not receive remedial measures until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important stronghold of the rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who “are being eradicated.”
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and push the way for elections.
Moualem defined the Syrian government's terms of participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump will achieve his second term
Following this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency will end prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
Without a doubt, it would be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness of the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers during its peak viewing time, which is according to Nielsen more than four years ago, when it had 1.7 million, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an acclaimed comedy writer and author of “Just Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Cheating at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember to take a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mr. Scovell.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what can be seen on television, the story from Washington could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wad case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.

There was no way he could break apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.

Foreign money is in the process of preparing for the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district they see a flood of money, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat due to the rearrangement of the congressional districts.
This recently re-divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrafted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally redrafted in favor of Republicans.
The match in the new 17th district touched on the campaign funding struggles between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the U.S., they thought about sanctions against Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled Trump’s leadership.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama from “the recent decision to end Taiwan’s recognition,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were being considered with regard to El Salvador, which is expected to receive $140 million in U.S. aid, according to estimates in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the limitation of financial assistance and the targeted restriction of visa issuance, would severely affect this Central American country, with high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference aimed at security and economic development, with which they would continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, senior government officials had explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding thoughts on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference participants, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and also spoke about it on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was cooperating with Russia in the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer the authorities before this and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions and I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, nor is the fall of his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a fight can be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike against Hitler if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We didn't succeed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of slaughter that followed.
On such breakthroughs, the flow of history is changing and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans are dealing with more of these kinds of fractures right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in the spotlight since this official reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated on his inadequacy of the situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report by an officer of The Times was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation required by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed as a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress, which will require the responsibility of Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will have a long winter of democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light a sabbatical candle on a table with swastikas.
How could I not be so optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented incumbent Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season before a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a springboard for bigger achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the conviction that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might be able to win in the end, but in general, the rhyme is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The past year has been undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season to ourselves and achieve success.”
Poor sleep of women due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people are talking to their family members about it.
Half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health care representative by setting the trust of a trustworthy person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts will comply with your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the person’s authorization for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent necessarily needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in the action plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of casualties is expected to increase further.
When communications were interrupted, rescuers from the Donggala region north of Paluj, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palua after the earthquake.
Some key information about Paluja and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggaga is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, the administrative unit under the province, had an estimated 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the central region of the Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also an important activity, which is mainly taking place in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo, according to a report by Indonesia's Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency, have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in the Dongli.
In 1996, the tsunami also hit northern Donggalo and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia sits on a seismically active Tihoocean fire ring, which is why earthquakes occur here on a regular basis.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A type of strong earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Flooding affected the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not start, but the fall of the buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin’s eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
The fuel was seized at the Mat-Su Predkazensk facility and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "absolutely innocent" when asked about the defense, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three Class A offenses, meaning it could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B felony, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
The fuel of the crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for her son's violent behavior linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been disrupted, and the number of fatalities is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were detained at a beach festival in the city of Pal.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect of terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifullah Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died. It is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crimes in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a delivery truck to carry out a bicycle attack along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip had “intentionally” killed eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to a death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty could be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the grand federal court in Saipo informed the prosecutor in 22 points, which included eight charges of murder in aid of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and cover-up,” said prosecutors, who described Sai’s manner as “stupid, cruel and defiant.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enc<0xC3><0xAD>n Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagvesana.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District ruled the last death penalty ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in a federal case in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
In the days and months following the attack, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regrets, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saip told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS that he had seen on the phone.
The police also said they had demanded the disarming of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
With regard to the 22 points of the indictment, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipo, said he was “apparently disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering in connection with these events,” Patton said.
Saif's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGELA FARAGEA should be in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Turin MEP
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at the Tory Conference that he would “mobilize the human army”.
The former Ukipa leader said politicians must “feel the heat” of Euroscepticism when one of his own MPs, Therese May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “be out now” if he were Brexit secretary Mr Farage.
But the challenge facing Mr. Mayev in coordinating his deeply divided species was highlighted by the Tories, who favored the resignation of the brexit, who joined a separate protest against the city’s Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her plan in check amid attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayev in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as the interlocutor and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, he'd be out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The thought that the British have changed and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue.”
The meeting was also attended by the Turin-based brexitor Andrea Jenkins, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Minister-in-Office, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unpopular with our client and our activists, who are active on the streets and even lead us to elections.
Please let go of the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs Maye, she added: “The prime ministers keep their job when they deliver on their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given a “feeling of warmth” if they intend to issue a decision made in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to release Brexit and today we’re coming together to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do this.’”
In a statement, he said: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit, to feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the remainers walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
After the group was founded this weekend, a group of activists gathered the flags of the Tories against Brexit.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for security concerns when using the client’s app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the border without barriers, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's possible appeal for president's position will "exactly study"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “participation in the presidential race will be carefully studied” after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
He is at the center of speculation that he could face Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which demands a woman at the top.”
Arrested after death of LSU Sims player in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station is news of the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the event, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department police station.
Sims, a 198-centimeter-old youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the World Champion title, and the team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettel win.
On Saturday, when Valtteri Boltas qualified for Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas started off well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the ground as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel first drove into the boxing and let Hamilton drive on the traffic lane, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him into the box later and left him for Vettel, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferrari driver's unpretentiousness leaves the inside open and the risk of being left behind after two defensive moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was in seventh place until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then spent most of the race without changing tyres as he intended to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally led to the boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had been driving fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me out.
“The team has done a really great job of reaching first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump at a meeting on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose the letter Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate inquiry committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt and deceitful.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days, that we can see anger when you can see that people are mean, corrupt and false,” he said.
“When you look at posts and revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it to him... No, we didn’t,” he added, referring to the senator’s impression.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not disclose her letters,” The Hill Feinstein’s official told the commission.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not fit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I’m telling you, this was a really bad body language.
It may not be, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You’ve seen the evil, the greed, they don’t care who they’re hurting and who they have to drive to get into power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars bought themselves back for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5:3 victory at the Saturday game in Dundee.
The Giants scored two goals in a match against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home side, and then Dwyer again scored an advantage for Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled the Dundee before two goals from Lundwald Nielsen gave them a win.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2:1 from the background on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, winning Giantsi in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull's assist, Beauwillier, who scored four minutes later, and was handed over by David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan led the home side to the game again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave the Cowni to equalize at 15:16.
Dwyer led the Giants on vacation when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first third.
The home side got together again, and Bouchard made up for the setback with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead at the end of the second third, taking care of a win with his team's fifth goal of halftime, and taking care of a win with their team's fifth goal in the last half of the third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on the plane to escape the quake with his death.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after sacrificing their lives so that the plane could safely take off with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed in Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami, and many were missing.
The area continues to be stressed by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workplace in a heavily-swimming control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was giving up.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, the Australian media house ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart beats when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, as the country’s Disaster Relief Agency said access to cities in the Donggala, Sigis and Boutonga were limited.
“The death toll is expected to rise further, as many bodies were under the rubble, and many of them we could not reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s representative.
A fire, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been extinguished by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and support.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
“Minimum markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pula and told the National Army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says it misses one person after it was originally reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
They told the airline that they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to the call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane was missing a runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane went down very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to get through to the belt of running water until the emergency exits on the sinking aircraft.
He said the stewardesses panicked and cried, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the help was also provided by the sailors who repaired the wreckage nearby. In the rescue, they helped with the use of an inflatable boat, with which people were transported to the mainland before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday presented its evidence in a retrial to a man who was accused of being burned alive in 2014 by a woman from Mississippi.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, which contradicts his previous claims, a Clarion Ledger official reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he "was lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he had known her for about two weeks.
The videos on the mobile phone show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that in the time following Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He took it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the trial would be judged by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip hop has distanced itself from original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and again make conscious hip-hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York security guard sues couple for firing her over 'racist' message
The New York City security guard is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving the wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she found out that she was black when the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEE IS ONE CHILD,” Plasco-Flaxmanova wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After finding out about her harassment, Plasco-Flaxmanova, who felt “unpleasant,” fired Mr. Maurice, saying that her outgoing guardian, who was African-American, was doing poorly, so she wanted to hire a Filipino, the New York Post official reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice’s now asking for compensation from the couple in court, amounting to $350 a day for a six-month period of work she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, these things aren’t being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, as they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after their regrets.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened wrong?
Your newborn?
Come on."
When comparing the lawsuit to “immigration,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to deal with someone like that?
That’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still pending before the court, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media for their conduct and way of thinking.
Publishers of stories about the Paddington bear feared that readers would not associate with the talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now that Paddington has become a tremendous success.”
She said that her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before receiving inspiration for writing a children's book about a small bear toy, would be outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that it was the 60th anniversary of the book "grenko-sweet" last year after his death.
Regarding Paddington’s bear, whom she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was the man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had been achieved by your child: You’re proud of him, even if you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think Paddington's success was viewed in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone from her.
Upon her arrival, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to preserve her life.
“She called me regularly to tell me that she felt really bad, that she didn’t expect that to happen,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call, and he told me he was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, that's how I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly taking and leaving her system.
She had been dying for some time and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a position when I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who had already complained about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the trials she was undergoing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head tilted, and tears were running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Complaining women's beauty posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one due to suicide are trying to turn others away in order to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Walloon Bridge are glued posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he went into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
However, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a date when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made the posters, “to let other people know that there are people available that you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for several years, and Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, lost shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “She poisoned a hole in the whole family.
She betrayed us.
But we have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the FBI's investigation into the air
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for – a limited investigation after the duration and scope of the investigation, it might make us feel better,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the world would be “disintegrated” because of a strengthened party stance.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is the result of the time the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to make a poor cut, this will greatly weaken them in an attempt to elect a wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned the senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would lead to Mike Pence, the vice president, beating himself out of office and being elected to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has been reduced under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that last year there were more than 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the price hikes demanded by human traffickers.
Pjongjang has not publicly commented on this yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross as a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on him.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has described Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and says she is not fit for a job at the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court a “hysterical one” and said it was “significantly inappropriate” for a job at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman, if she behaved like this, would be labeled ‘hysterical,’” Kavanaugh said Thursday before the Senate inquiry.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally he nearly broke in, and smothered himself in the discussion of his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the charges against himself a “grotesque and coordinated smear” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony has proved that he should not be appointed as a supreme judge because it has shown that he is biased towards Democrats.
“I think that with such statements and the way Clinton and the Democrats got involved, he was discredited,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, it will become for a moment.
“I’ll say this – if Congress or the FBI doesn’t tell the truth, it’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court it’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the case of Roe against Wada was a matter of concern as a Democrat.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t this wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And a woman needs to be seduced.
This is a just outcome, after months and years of pouring anger, and it cannot be expressed without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” she told me 45 years later.
“That doesn’t seem very rare, do you think?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was a director somewhere who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and that is when she became angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe I’m sad because you’re crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was top notch.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying in unspeakable rage, was an event when an older woman grabbed me by the door – a cold leader who always scared me a little bit.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad to have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping across a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder deeply felt that there was no reason why she could not run for president alone.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she joked to me 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates have already participated in the competition and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
At the time, someone called the game 'Snowball and seven thumbs'.
Since she joined the last campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she decided not to enter the contest if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in the conversation that she was not going to start official campaigns, her emotions—thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism—beat her so hard.
“They’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the media’s reaction.
"I think he's my official sponsor, Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
“But she was crying?”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle has not been over for a long time, experts say the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move its eye to the United States and is unlikely to budge any time soon.
In order for Washington to step down, China should agree to his demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knew how to make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic meltdown in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional co-worker who is focusing on the struggle.
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help in restoring the country, which has been abandoned for more than seven years in the war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground due to the fight against terrorism is more stable and safer,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all the conditions are met for the refugees to return to the country voluntarily, which they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the restoration of an abandoned country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup against the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championship, slipped the ball into the water at the 16th hole in a par-3 game in his initial stroke, causing the game to be handed over to Francesca Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has shone through all the rounds and has become one of the four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 result at any time since the start of the championship in the current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark by 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in Ryder's Cup last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player in the championship of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year was hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in you.
So happy, so happy that we won the cup again.
It’s about the team and I’m really happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The team is handed over to John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in the individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods, and when I grew up, I watched his games,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the entire championship.
After a poor performance for his team, the American captain said, “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.”
In the morning, we had a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We've failed.
The hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will have to come together again, I will work with the American League of the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move on.
I really like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get down.
“They beat us.”
