Members of the National Assembly of the Land of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Assembly of the Land of Galilee are appalled because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of the Land of Galilee).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Parliament of the Land of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of the Republic of Wales is concerned that "it is related to Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Wales Country Party of the National Assembly of the Wales Country said that, as a whole, the group "is not delighted" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an "open" attitude toward changing the name, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the Land of Galilee as well as the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, said: “The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend even on those members.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 offered the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the ‘Parliament of the Land of Galilee’.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus might give Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to send the bill on changes in the course of the process.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the final say in terms of their title when the law is debated.
Macedonia Votes for Referendum on Change of Name of Country
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on the change of their country’s name to “North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued, insistently, that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of the Episcopal Church of St. Martin stopped beating as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem.
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church on every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars and churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as for the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that, “earlier or later, the homeless will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore, this will accelerate the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move in these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who carry out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's enormities made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who put the carillon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said it was the first carillon in the world to be performed by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors by the apostles.
Some of the giants complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese has shown.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy trying to catch a human in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch a manor in California on the opening day of the manor season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved in with a group that helped him get out of school.
Hammel also said that he initially believed the boy was delighted that he had caught a lobster, but then realized that the scream “He bit me!
It bites me!”
The entire clavicle was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I shouted to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it was not a species of shark that posed a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen its position in the UK’s beauty and fashion products market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the position on the UK beauty products market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not on the scale, if the larger areas with beauty products in store will be more than 11 months ahead of the test.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s representatives said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of make-up products, Boutique, which means that most products are destined for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young shoppers.
In addition, French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury chain stores for testing, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s retailer, said the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the struggle with large discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to re-freeze its pharmaceutical and beauty product compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations stopped after a divergence in how Boots store revenue was shared in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury Retailer said: “We have transformed the look of our areas with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
"Dragons' Den" TV star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truely brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old show host, announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby has generated the fury of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show "Dragons' Den", retiring at the last minute from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense session at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million yen, were not worth a penny.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would almost double Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would give up the contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A statement from a source said: “Trily was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire has shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday, there was little left until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the show's presenter "This Morning", which ranks among the best-selling stars in the UK, could cause the company millions of losses as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing items and household items, as well as possible chains.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are 10-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundation of the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He joked about the critics he would receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider “unquestionable to a president” and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude in regards to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said he imitated a voice as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed a "appropriate response" from the United States regarding the North's actions in the past.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything goes well with North Korea,” he said.
“It’s time to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, the support provided for the release of hostages, and the return of American troops.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act like a president, but if I behaved like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this unstoppable arena, there would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering aid actions at the international level.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about the fact that I do not seek international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation,” Sumbang said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for Indonesia’s national disaster agency, said authorities in Indonesia are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes sustained by Indonesia, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be under-prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not encountered very often on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the islands of Indonesia turns out to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this even more difficult.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving precarious infrastructure in Indonesia be the focal point of his election campaign and has presciently allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims roamed the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives save goal and equals score in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters from the opponent's gate, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before shooting in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached over which, heading towards the corner at the top right of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to move as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think about it very much, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 to a break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacking blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned in the middle of the field and ran to the half of the Liverpool team's field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who got into the basket.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the ball to the pitch, hitting it with his left foot and passing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude quake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman by stabbing him.
An investigation into the murder began after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to the subject to come to the statement section.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the initial stage, but I appeal to all the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the on-board camera to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, at the scene of the murder came a few people who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
The people living in the building were told it would take a few hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
In front of the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two cops were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to the <0x40>MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention the case 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the latest memorial affected by altercations on the "rewriting of history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical puritanical followers.
However, Cromwell described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing the statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.
A pig has caused the death of a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut off and was covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday edition of the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he came with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby cottage was open.
He said that in the corner there was a male pig of large size with blood on his mouth.
Legitimate doctors have confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and lacerations," said the cousin, whose surname is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday, at 4:40 a.m., to feed his pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man’s death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and authorities appear to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, there have been reports of cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
10 years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from the Land of Galilee was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves to the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressive area over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the intense wetness of the tropical U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There may be rapid flooding due to rapidly deteriorating conditions as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into ripples and dust.
The depressive area that is approaching will bring torrential rains to areas off the southern coast of California.
There are possible rainfalls of almost 2 cm, which could lead to minor flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S., as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic differences in temperature in the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the extended summer heat will try to form and expand again.
A large portion of the central and eastern U.S. area is expected to face a warm beginning of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extensive areas, from the southern plains to certain parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above average for the U.S. East by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement backed by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting Friday’s normal schedule for a last-minute news: an agreement between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the court that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was drunk and that he was trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who see from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or with the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily audience.
ABC ranked second, with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
She was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which is demanded by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Games’ About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union for “political games” with Britain’s future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside his photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union were "to renegotiate their tariffs" was "to renegotiate
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of fatally shooting LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims at the age of 20.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Legal Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot to the head through the neck.
The department awards merits to the Louisiana police force, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for the help provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for “diligence and the search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastating" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to keep their distance from the volcano after the activity in the crater was triggered and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several bursts and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Interference between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away by gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The impeachment intensified later, with police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, while the Unionist protesters shouted “Live Spain!”.
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, by a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession boycotted, for the most part, the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year I experienced some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying with joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing more to do,” he said.
Despite obtaining a vital but tight victory in the regional elections of December last year, the pro-independence Catalan parties tried to keep the momentum this year, many of the most well-known leaders being either in their own exile or in detention, waiting for the return of the coup d'état.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians from both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate in the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: More Men Arrested After Getting into a House by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a Londonderry home.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and even the building had been caused.
It seems that at some point a counter-argument was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers undefeated, Steven Gerrard reaching his second win in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team remains undefeated in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Holt's team should have moved on long before enrolling, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to shoot in port space, then Alan Lithgow managed to shoot wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors to free kicks.
And that was how the crucial hole came in.
Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed to open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who shot and scored from the centre of which.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble for the rest of the match.
This game model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not succeed against Rangers' Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a wide shot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in the Livingston team, but without success, and the two criminal applications - after Halkett had scuttled Glenn Middleton and after a henchman - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and the team have not changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for how he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the match.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have performed well since they were led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty passes were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the door of free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the rankings.
Mixed reactions on Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all rosy on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police have called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters have gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with open arms in the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died in front of the scene.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in a Ceasefire
Six officers in the prison have been injured following a jail term at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a switch was triggered at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m., which is currently underway.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the breach, in which eight inmates are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized personnel was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff received medical attention after they were injured.
We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules as to who is responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last year, in October, officers dealing with disorders were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy the benefits as a result)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada region, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix announced in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona faces at least a severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Mexico’s torrential rains could be significant, posing a high flood risk.
“Torrential rains are expected to range between 8 and 10 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach as much as 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States,” said a representative of the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden flooding, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area last night, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who could have materials on their mobile phone, respectively, to present themselves to the police department.
Trump says Kavanaugh has faced the Democratic Party's "disgrace and anger"
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party’s “disgrace and anger” during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims about sexually harassing her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation,” he told many supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination while speaking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but, in a way, I’m a candidate,” he said.
“For this reason, I express everywhere a positive opinion about candidates that I consider to be wonderful.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a GOP executive assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them taken by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when six-meter-high waves hit the beach at the bottom, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still watching their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled far at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to get rid of the tsunamis and survived.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the reprisals continued to crush the city on the coast.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb from World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, the representative added.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications were "completely disrupted, without any information" in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticized for not informing it that a tsunami was going to hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In the posts on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to initiate relief actions in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, materials and personnel can only reach the point of production of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s another provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government will say, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the earthquake and Friday tsunami in Pau, the friends and families of the missing hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who was in ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to it.
Gendon Subandano, the head coach of the national paratrooper team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the paratrooper pilots missing.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in parapanta activity, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse in the parapanta sports practitioners community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages appeared only a gray bee, and not two blue bees.
“I think that means the messages have not been sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee feeding a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car was chasing a ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs through the back of Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money that needs to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "the individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release its new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious significance for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as part of a discussion about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s me, it’s us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means unique, and got to "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who chose to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West co-worker, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cream, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexico’s president says he will not use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use military forces against civilians, with the country approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when students’ leftist movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said that the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after more U.S. government members have made announcements about AI, even though there is a lack of an official artificial intelligence strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in AI will be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later became executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government competitions in the field of technology, such as the Agency’s Robotics Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s driving academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think that PhDs in AI should automatically be offered a visa,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
Also, at this time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country’s name to be changed to the “North Macedonia Republic”, a change that would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on the presence in the vote, with the possibility of not reaching the minimum limit of 50%, necessary for validating the referendum.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted in the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with the right to vote voted.
“I have come to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for a referendum on Macedonia’s name change, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-scale scene and pulled seats in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can head to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that joining NATO will bring such necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after expressing his vote.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, below the number of participants needed.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance at the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since the government took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to pass Brighton's entire defensive line and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and on Saturday won the Manchester City team 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed to Aguero it was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to pass by a defender, and then outscored several opponents on the side of which team Brighton.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, avoiding Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the gate.
“Aguero is facing some problems on his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team, told reporters.
“I talked to him and I agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got the initial lead for the Blues in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball to the plate just before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies scored at least an unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win over the national team on Friday night, but still trying to retain their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, alongside the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first blow in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening stroke of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks until one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I don't run, but I'm actually running, so I'm trying to hold good candidates accountable," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see the evil of them.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, have power and control, and we’re not going to give it.”
He also said that Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“And you can see this in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angry and evil, ugly and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was strongly shunned by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Oh, please.
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
I was not at all surprised that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship motion as far as I am concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which neither Jeremy had any common views with previous leaders.
The Labour Party’s communiqué for Friday’s meeting in Nottingham East said: “We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision in terms of politics were beginning to expect me to change my thinking and agree on some things that I would not have agreed with before, including the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there follows a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing the center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination I give to my colleagues who are facing sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion to censor or change the rules of selection, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have recommended that I put my head down over the last two years, not be so vocal, and everything “will be fine” like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence that the Thatcher government has shown led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need of them, or locals, of quality.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, in the context of the country heading for Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from taking any interest in you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the standings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today's extremely interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
He is now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took advantage of the chances that came up, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
“We have been tested several times in our games so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The Merits give themselves to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the odds more than we did.”
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow cardman received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, he played at the Warriors, allowed the team Melrose to change the score to a non-scorer.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to transform an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr on break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was kicked out of the field with the goal, and since the restart of the game, Ayr has been unleashed through the trial of player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he liked Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the try, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth try.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing her script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry information, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the “restaurant development industry.”
“The sea is ours”: the island of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings have blue flags, just like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and senility and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign offshore exit, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president – who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year – also has a lot to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands has no power to grant territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years would have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually quick.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appearing to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic actions on the nuclear threat more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "irreal dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean War would ever cause the northern territory to give up.
Washington has reluctance to agree with the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics who don’t believe that the Phoenician has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of Kim-Trump.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect you from the sun, you no longer need to look for them.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The practically no-shows took over the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent the creations that steal their eyes on the podium.
The piece of creation’s resistance, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, beige hat with a wide boron, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included beaded peppers, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion haute couture.
One of the creations seemed to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are in luck.
The stylists expect a return of huge dolls in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the wide-brimmed straw hat seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the non-practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, respectively of the beach pajamas, of the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The raffie orange bag, with raffie fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer collection “La Riviera” at Paris Fashion Week.
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic Competences, Essential to Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test results, which is backed by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French and 63% of those who study Spanish.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that for the reasons that employers gave for the struggle for the job, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With multiple job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill throughout their life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have a greater chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking into perspective by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be several languages of choice within independent schools, with didactic frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the country’s future, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well (you have to do it).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
“There will be more than one and fewer than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play limited minutes.
Following the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the press to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first of five rallies scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate elected by him for the seat of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s West Virginia election rally take place tonight and where can I watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, a hearing that has become strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, as the FBI invests in the acube.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, win some ground.
Thus, those in President Trump’s campaign said that the role of these five rallies next week is “the energization of volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the highly crowded campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple trials starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible Saturday afternoon’s foursome test might have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in the case of competitions like this one.
So where is their motivation now?
“We were driven by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we’re relying on this drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points left in the game.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is beginning to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won three out of four points each.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those gullible holiday screams became more and more noisy as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he equalised the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were driven by two points after the first two holes.
The blow that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you believe that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry only about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all there is to these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed reveal of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems they can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra punch on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would ultimately lead to a potential victory of Europeans when the sun sets.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for the time being.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly from Sergio Garcia, the morning's hero to the four-ball test, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles to the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and well-deserved due to the interactions between pairs, the advice given and ungiven and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it ended Saturday's four-ball and four-seater games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourball test and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from the four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they stood superbly to defeat the disgruntled Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional snippets of genius, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 games to fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, the world's first and third positions.
Europe, however, did not have an unobstructed route on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 a game against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursome, after losing the four-balls.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the trials simply, though, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of disarming unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that in North Korea "significant measures have been implemented to prove their good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and the commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and weapons technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can’t disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar objections to Washington’s opposition to a “staggered” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took step-by-step, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject the denuclearization of the nuclear deal.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during a premier summit between a U.S. president and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress towards a "denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula", while Trump was a North Korean.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not given way to requests for relaxation of tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists on the option of ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can screw us up is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, over the past five months, adding: “If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been possible.”
Even under these conditions, Ri’s speech was very different from that of last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea after “Mr. Evil President” Trump sent a “sync” to Kim.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for the courage to start the disarmament process, but said the work is just beginning and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea is no longer in power.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterrupted until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but just hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that it had made “gangster threats.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest.
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them subject to “all-night” energized, high-caffeinated learning sessions.
A scientist has found that, often, students of the world’s most prestigious universities do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this just now, in the last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
An hour-long course can involve a series of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a homeroom, and students can click on coffee pots, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of coffee and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, but also about the importance of a sound program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of developing heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know that we cannot change the behavior of our students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they’ve learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of a good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes them sleepy.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after taking one of his first-year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling in this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler advised students to program an alarm to know when it’s time to sleep, as well as for waking up hours, and to know what are the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb circadian rhythm and cause sweating.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal down Gerrard's team
Rangers are suffering another case of moving depression as Dolly Menga's hit sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to get their first away win from the 4-1 victory against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, putting the Rangers with eight points to the top spot.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players didn’t seem to be able to match at all.
The Rangers fell to sixth in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third, behind Hibernian, to a single-goal difference.
And Rangers could face other problems as the cauldron referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was, apparently, thrown out of the visitor's team's paws.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot who easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equal with the Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot smothered his opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have marched just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass pushed Scott Pittman to the defensive gate by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they had more hope than they trusted in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed only two shots on the goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although the 34-minute goal from Livingstone did not respect the game's trend, no one can deny that it was deserved, either, or only for the effort.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep Jacobs centering.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted on the break, when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost immediately gave way, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the pits to block him.
However, Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's shot, then Lithgow sent the header on the side of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers reserveer, applied for a penalty at the end of the game, but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page in our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the CONTINUOUS counting...), is the day on which, in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with improbable inclinations.
The man: “What else is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these caps, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yes, you can hear a lot of pranks!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before turning 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein for many cancers and then are re-injected.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a common protein for many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove immune cells from patients and to "teach" them to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe in support of Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance at the SNL.
It didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was huddled in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a disgruntled show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene played by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe footage was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the ass because of his pocket.
“They tried to intimidate me in the ass.
They said to me, “Don’t go out wearing this skirt.”
I was assaulted!
They also told me that I got very low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see how far down I’ve come?”, then said that “I’m going to catch Superman’s mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted evacuees from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from this team told the publication: “In the studio, a complete silence was expected.”
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits of us: YOU’RE MULTIPLE AND THEY’RE INVOLVING THE GLOBAL.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) that I think embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the officially known being Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Urzeal Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series The Urzeal of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that it seems that "something went wrong" and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity can be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Urzeal co-worker, said she was “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about how to be an adult, given the problem we are facing right now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys learn from TV and on the street, what makes them think that it has to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it’s clear that something bad has happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Urzeal of the Thrones after the series ended in the summer of next year, saying that "it ended with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series Urzeal Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it ensured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the multi-award winning fantasy series Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get to marry a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of the disease come from inappropriate measures of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked the Republican Party senators’ data, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and websites of the “extreme right.”
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included senators' personal addresses and phone numbers, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a judge in the Supreme Court.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
He doesn't have to be defiant.
It is not necessary to question the defendant’s motivation.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Important, if it is true,” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had alerted “adequate authorities and legal entities regarding these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will answer to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of the members of my team.”
Johnny English strikes again: wet parody of spy movies with Rowan Atkinson in the lead role
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parody series that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming to life.
Will this bleak satire of how strange we are to become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, to Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his eyes peeled and the face of the rubber, was renewed for the second time his license to break everything. The character's name signifies, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in the black-and-white countries.
He is, of course, the discreet secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a tip of the knife from that guy who contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Opening Ceremony.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades easily hit his hair.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, strangely enough, superfluous, especially because “serious” films such as those in the 007 series or Impossible Mission reliably provide comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy web and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, to the dismay of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a pompous and under siege prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can with her character like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she needs to activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English’s very own masterpiece, now working as a teacher in a high school, which also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some nice jokes, because English runs a spy academy in the style of School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of the creation of entanglements in the Secret Service of His Majesty return into action, confronting the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: dressed in waiters, setting fire to a trendy French restaurant, creating chaos as they crawl aboard Volta’s luxury vessel, then English triggers pure-form anarchy when she tries to use a real-life shawl for her family.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film, it seems like a children’s television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but ask myself: Can the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role in terms of his talent?
Labour denies that they plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
That way, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say the idea would “fit” the party’s economic agenda, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a suitable aspiration in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party's overall strategy on industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The shadow cabinet’s chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “winners” from utility companies.
The plans of the shadow cabinet chancellor also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their shares entirely, because the Labour government may perceive “deductions” due to established offences.
He also confirmed plans to appoint workers on companies’ boards of directors and create ownership funds by which to transfer 10% of private sector firms’ equity to employees, which will thus receive an annual dividend of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation would make him change his mind
The FBI’s investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to support him because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I’ve said that since the beginning of the hearings; I’ve talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, promptly, without equivocation."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be buried in stone.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so we're going to need some explosive charges," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely rejects the allegations,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her have confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that something will change.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eliminating global poverty.
Reaching its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on Central Park, not only to pursue artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other meaningful deletions.
But what success did the Global Citizen’s Festival have when they are only 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion had already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of some 700 investors and middlemen who have pledged to "help children grow to their full potential", which has promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the elimination of the bulk of food waste.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and some global citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book,” Tracey Ullman, the 2018 ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, said in a live interview.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists to sing at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a “block” that would aggravate Russia’s energy exports, says the Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to mediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said of Russia, saying he “knows one trick” because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost liquefied natural gas exports in Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S. ferocious opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we’re looking at things the same way: energy can’t be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position attracted critics from Germany, who reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in our energy issues,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is “seriously thinking” about running for president in 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would have to "think seriously" if she could run for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During the meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that’s why a strong woman is needed,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously think about running for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate he nominated for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy from former governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy for it and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run for president in 2020 are Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Track Palin suffers from at a Donald Trump meeting
The 26-year-old track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things my own son is going through, the things he's gone through after he's returned... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress disorder and the traces of the wounds our soldiers are going through," Trump said at a rally in support of Trump.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, harder, coming back wondering if there's any more respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the others have done for Artera.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence, and holding a drunk firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia contest a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the violence caused by poaching or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a request for a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support a policy dispute over asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorney named Grace has described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem of domestic violence and harassment.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
“Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” writes amicus curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in the lawsuit that policies that deny immigrants entry affect the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor force.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, in June ordered judges for immigration cases to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape abuse and violence from the hostages.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll doubled, in a race against a timer to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly serious.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is lining up her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances bring corpses all the time.
Drinking water is not enough.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous responses.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Abusing’ Propaganda Ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 election for Congress, an accusation China rejects.
The allegation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters it is a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements in which they promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war, which involves rising waves of import tariffs.
The tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When it spreads propaganda by publishing an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the so cherished tradition of free speech and free press in America,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the Communist Party is under control.”
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it is about.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially on the part of women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated on Senate halls when Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not approve of the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it could follow a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has become a mess for Republicans,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, it's also about how Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic electoral support group.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seems to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said that they believe it strongly or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as by at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford said under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her, drunk, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute with appropriate resources, processes, and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely out of date.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor of the United Kingdom.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said he was “symbolized” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Canal "with a very low cloud and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery shell alone and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I will never be able to match, but that makes me feel humble.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but received cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all satisfied, because they stood up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to a children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content isn’t appropriate for 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by viewers in the UK.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably solve it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday day here and we can’t do that until Sunday, our hour, or Monday, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to resolve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’ll be summarizing five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans and exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ Because of Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people’s rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months due to an illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like both boys and girls."
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and endurance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he’s “someone,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without a trace, and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley got married last year to the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he said, “he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would have gone through the same time.”
The two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, which, Daley says, changed his "whole perspective."
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they got tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You can’t be first, Dad,’” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he no longer breathed and died did I finally accept that it was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that to this I had dreamed of a lifetime, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday, at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup match, but he will have to return to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was traded to captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for Saturday's fourball and foursome trials.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the five-time major tournament winner split the day between being a cheerleader for the teammates and practicing his hits, hoping he will correct what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong shots.
And if the field isn’t a big enough challenge, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has teamed up with the Tommy Fleetwood novices and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, driven by four points at the entrance in the 12 simple matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk was confident in his player’s ability, but he couldn’t have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he hit me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to his personal record level.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to play with players, he's a great guy in the team locker room," he said.
“I think the young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, it is not just about the game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple tests in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Denmark made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but only if they managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember having had a considerable lead at Valderrama; I had a big lead at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching how the 2018 team, which won by 5-3, both on Friday and Saturday.
“So history shows me, me and my team, that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at maximum touring.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, this must remain the goal.
We have always said we need to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what awaits us in the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the way his players have handled themselves in a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, that you have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and have to play as well as they can.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with their partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was in the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing one when Europe succeeded in the "Medina miracle".
“I remember every word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those matches from the middle.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said of the lot for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be fitted with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to leave on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these next-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would have made the warship unnecessary on a combat mission.
The software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews of the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel was much too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy’s ability to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that say that Germany’s maritime power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy “began to be without vessels that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has steadily increased over time, as the old vessels have been removed from service without being replaced with some new ones.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered service in the Military Navy.
National Trust Spying on the Secret Life of Lilies
New research that is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how they use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these new flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pigment bats, as well as eardrums and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activity of the lilies during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit certain sounds.
There will also be a map of the habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scale-up picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and what is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are dangerous to the construction and development work that affects their nests, but also to the loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, just like mouse traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
In fact, Lilies are not blind.
However, due to the fact that they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control the nests, and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization created Scotland's first and only bat reserve, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Dreamave, the area is great for butterflies,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply.”
It underlines the importance of looking for bats before performing property maintenance work, as simply unintentionally destroying a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations against him were “fake news” and that some people “want to advertise” using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker and the Juventus team were accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the allegations were released, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is fake news,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball said in front of the video camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called “an inadmissible report of private life suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “equivalent moral damages with an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped an anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he is "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that she had sex with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photos with her wounds were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "terrorized by the possibility of a retaliation" and was concerned that she "will be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret forever' the loss of automakers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is “worrying” that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fixed-time” principle: for custom-made cars, the parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to industrial manufacturers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of its inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told Today on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers, shows that we need to continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be halted, but warned that increased prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the United union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs are not coming back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “a week late” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in elections, the links between Trump’s and Russia’s aid and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors about Trump’s ability to fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which once again delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not yet been established in this regard. It may be this week or it may be delayed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy towards TV reporters, whom he liked to give on the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to give on the show."
Then, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president attends more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, but “I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to address questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time and you could see that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace the press briefings when it is available."
Usually, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre occasions, in front of reporters gathered.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addressed, in a letter, to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter on condition that it remains less than six months until the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, waiting for decisions this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, but also outside the European Union, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers founder Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a stroke late Saturday, in the match the team lost to teammate Vanderbilt Commodores, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Ogan.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“It got to the tuxedo line and it just crashed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on oxygen mask by physical preparers and medical staff, on the tuxedo line, before placing it on a plate and transporting it from the field for a detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details on the type/ extent of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in Year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five runs in total before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 runs throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee on the purchase of a property in the UK, with additional money being used to help homeless people, according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp duty will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of court fees for buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as it is set to announce today Theresa May.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s successful efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher court fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers and taxed in the UK, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support the government’s efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current court fee of the stamp, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
About 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which leads to rising prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in court fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land without using them, and asked Theresa May to waive the fees for affordable homes in order to solve the “home problem” in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
He also wants to give council more power in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will dedicate my prime minister’s mandate to fulfill the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means addressing the problems that exist in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one far too far away, and living in unsavory conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team”
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said the "final goal" was to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the North-Eastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after the St. Mirren football team’s return to the first division of the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got into the B team of the national team and that’s it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as the manager of the club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he has no emotions to be the successor to such a dedicated name and to such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back in the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has just three years of leadership experience, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped the Alloa club recover after he retired to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over the leadership of the Alloa club.
“I really thought I was more suited to the role of manager than the role of player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good time, I won well and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager when it comes to stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me the best of my adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 on the Sportsound show from Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink half a beer is Saturday, at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
This summer’s heatwave has led to an increase in revenue in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenue dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s representative who provides business consulting services and who conducted the survey, said: “The constant warmth and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, the previous year, the previous month, the previous month, the previous month, the previous year.
The number of customers with 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has dropped even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs serving food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
It seems that people have gone out into the city just to consume drinks.
“Drink sales at all bars and pubs have risen by 6.6% this month, and food has fallen by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to record losses, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long cannibal summer couldn’t come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have a secret account on a social network that parents and teachers hide.
A survey conducted at a number of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” accounts.
The news raised fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “principal” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create an account on a social network they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “false Insta” accounts, referring to Instagram’s photo sharing platform.
The news raised fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show to their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, noticed a teenager’s post asking to be “violated.”
According to research conducted by Digital Awareness in the UK and the HMC (Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people aged between 11 and 18 years have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they are self-employed.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘the voice of athletes’ in Scotland’s Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the position of Director, without executive power, of the Athletes’ Commission in Scotland, during the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated field and track athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions as regards sports to take advantage of the vast experience he has gained internationally lately.
“Eilidh enjoys the respect of the entire community of athletes in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits along with its inclusion in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and to help the way sports activities are carried out in Scotland.”
The American athlete, who won 200- and 400-meter trials at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, has become disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows shares public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump company has challenged the division of public opinion in the online environment with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding moms.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of cow dung on a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm fine, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not owls, but my breasts."
“I pump, I pump, I breastfeed, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them declaring that it brings out the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen from their children just a few days from birth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is, both for the mother and for the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Other people defended the ad, one person claiming that it appeared to be a “hilarious” ad.
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a vacuum.
Advertising is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like the ‘wigs’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like they’re voicing.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even go out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner, Consultant and Design Developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it takes to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have caused the child placement procedure to worsen.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid that they will jeopardize their stay in the country if they request to take up children.
Risks rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult members of the family, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking customs and immigration official (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means that we will continue to look for these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the system of children, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must present themselves in court within one month of detention, and not within 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to claim legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without providing them with enough time for emotional preparation or to take care of their friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering from.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed."
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been uprooted from their homes.
He also said Damascus will continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military troops from the United States, who are mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", prompting refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have asked for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to remove the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale attack with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have ties to the al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the current articles of the constitution" and issued a warning of interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
If we were to take on this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, except if the removal procedure or scandals would end his presidential term early, which a large part of the liberal audience hopes to happen.
In this case it would, without a doubt, be “the most dramatic final of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, the Fox News television post is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded a record audience, with 3.5 million people following it.
"This is a topic that attracts the public because we can't understand it," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's dramatic "Reserve President" series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be comprehensive about the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you're not just an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of the discussion by a panel of experts on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about the dust jacket of Paul's 1st floor.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“A large part of what it does gives you the feeling that you’re watching a reality show and feeding you on topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “Aches of the Amanette,” about the constant and challenging distribution of Trump’s misadventures.
Don’t let yourself lose an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, there were 27 degrees outside and there was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He couldn’t get out of front of the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and was about to decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember we were doing some shows that went out in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Extensive external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, which resulted from two holders of the mandate in an election race for the same office, it is not at all surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Electoral District enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburg district brought in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th Electoral District, which is significantly outnumbered by the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating the boundaries of the districts in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district triggered a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-stakes election that took place in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For over a decade the position was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then has resigned.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement.
But they were only considered sanctions against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crimes in it.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from returning to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the top of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, seeking to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were co-sponsored by an external analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation and investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face the proper responsibility within the body, even as he prepares to stand before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a Trump “fall” is inevitable, and that’s also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on the one side and the other side of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed them and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year suggested the president’s secret record and speculated about his incompatibility with the president’s role.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak-born Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence a long time ago.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Players Graham Dorrans from Rangers are optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after Spain's impressive equal against Villarreal at the start of the month, will place her in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season up to the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could have scored in the final, but, overall, I think the match was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we noticed better in the second.
Thursday will be another big night for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my injuries and club changes, but the situation is better right now.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training goes also well.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about this.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by Nationwide said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had talked to their children about the subject.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's how you can start.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get involved with your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in terms of paying these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses, or you can secure your own well-being – as long as you have the money.
Put your legal documents in the right place: come to face the problems of a legal nature.
Get a mastery of medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also, take into account the performance of a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and who will ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who are the doctors who are dealing with it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of his dog?
Write a plan about all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air gun while walking home after a night spent in the city.
The victim, 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "accidental shootings".
The victim was unable to see his attacker.
The wounds do not endanger his life, and police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regent, an area north of the town of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree quake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of the central island of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Donggala is a regency that extends on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Mining activities for nickel mining are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regent, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra Island, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale took place near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya regent in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: More powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of his female identity tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody, at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is detained on the basis of a bailless bail of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “100% innocent” when his plea was filed, according to the network.
Palin faces three class A felony charges, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he gave her a fist in front of him.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after being part of Iraq's military forces.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the central province of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal Prosecutor Wants Capital Punishment for Suspect of New York City Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York wants capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trail in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to the intent opinion on the capital punishment application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both heads of indictment may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of murder that include eight counts of crime in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of the vehicle.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, suffering and losses for the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnicco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was fine with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the reticent.
Also, according to the police, he asked to plant the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 heads of indictment.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to impose capital punishment, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to apply capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would have come out” by now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May faces in terms of the extremely divided camps has been highlighted by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest, against leaving the European Union organized in the city.
The Prime Minister is blaming himself for his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to be carried out appropriately, facing the attacks by those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, and by the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "chaos".
Bone said at the pro-Brexit "Leave Means Leave" movement in Solihull that he wanted "the resignation of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, we were no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions on changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It is not at all true that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who go out in the street and who support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who hold office are the ones who keep their promises.”
During the meeting, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are about to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them do this."
In a message of enthusiastic gratitude, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party’s application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit does not bring benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to take his candidacy to the presidency seriously.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a meeting of the mayor’s office in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for office in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives for the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with citizens with the right to vote using the format of the mayor since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government and this includes for a woman to be at the forefront of it.”
A suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the event of the death of basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video footage of Friday’s shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death,” Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in front of the scene, holding a gun, but also shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the initial lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Standing first in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the boxing and left Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped the boxing tour later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the carriage and was in seventh place near the end of the first round, even on the day he turned 21.
Then he took the lead for a big part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at the box office at the 44th round, but was unable to step up in the last eight rounds, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and he acted like a real gentleman, letting me get in the way.
And the team has done an excellent job to win against Ferrari and to achieve this double,” said Hamilton.
A Horrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironised Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday during a meeting on the issue of her insistence that she did not facilitate the “empty” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, of assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are “living, immoral and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they’ve published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leaking of the document?
Do you remember her answer? Said: umm..poftim?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
“We did it, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and was "scarred" in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
"I have not hidden the allegations that concern Ford and I am not the one that facilitated the leaking of her report," Feinstein told the commission.
“He asked me to keep my privacy and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial does not seem to have hurt the president, who commented during Saturday’s meeting: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the most awful body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
“We are determined to take power in any way possible.
Look at the evil, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins 5-3 ahead of Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's loss to the Elite League, winning in front of the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return match, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, the beatings being carried out by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalised the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's players, who recovered the ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance kicked off in the fourth minute, 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's pass, then David Rutherford decisively passed to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamic, Sullivan returned the host team to the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first rematch.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard equalled again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's 5th place in the standings, halfway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after securing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several strong replicas took place in the area and many people are blocked under the remains of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was struggling hard.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision was likely to have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase as many victims are still in ruins and we did not have access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday, a joint funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to offer help to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by the earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing after it had previously said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since the afternoon of Saturday.
She also mentioned that she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The locals used the boats to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and reached a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has passed the end of the runway.
U.S. Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also said that the crew members panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said Marines working nearby to renovate a lander jumped in aid, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents a chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office closed its plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the recordings on his mobile phone to put the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis to a halt, as well as those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction to his previous claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
By the time the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The recordings on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues, as it initially did.
They want to go back to the origins and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another person of color?
A New York grandmother sues a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message.
A New York grandmother sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, complaining that she was “still a person of color.”
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new grandmother, Giselle Maurice, was of color when she showed up on her first day at work in 2016.
“NEW! WITH A PERSON OF CULTURE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After he realized the joke, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the grandmother, who is African-American, did not fulfill her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a New York national digger.
Maurice was paid for the workday and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for her dismissal and demands the sum of $350 a day for six months, the period in which she had to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
“I want to show them that they don’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve made a mistake with, even if it was a mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process a “extortion” action, Plasco said his wife will be born in two months and is in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person under such circumstances?
We don’t do that,” added the banker.
While the process is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proven.
Editors of Paddington’s story feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s really funny now that we’ve seen Paddington have had a huge success.”
She also stated that her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would be optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the three-year-old's books was "one of a kind."
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though he’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to get by by phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“I often call to tell me that it’s very serious and that he doesn’t think he’ll survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me she's going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors for her heart to continue to pump blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
It died a short time ago and the organs began to no longer function.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, being in pain after the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what was going on.
“No one knows,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a mollifying smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood.”
However, he gave up his job before he died, as he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still thinking you'll have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to tell people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get outside, you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's long-time friend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the kids had their presents unfolded and didn't even look him in the eye."
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “He caused immense pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation for a limited period of time and of limited scope – we could have little unity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” on the bottom of a block.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 election – if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner in the election for the country’s highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush also appealed to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean parliamentarian said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said last year about 1,127 people fled the country, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs charged by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Phenyan has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Phenian for a few discussions on the topic of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we won’t be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", saying he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as "sterile" and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘sterile,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that she had sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and lost his voice because of the emotions, while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “a grotesquely and co-ordinated murder of character” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he was of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed that he had a partisan character against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when he was asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say that if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it’s not right, not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical person, a partying person, to go to court and wait for us to say, ‘Wow! how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and cannot speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive role, who told me that she was also crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she was angry and began to cry, she would tell the person who she was going to cry with:
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
It seemed like a great thing to me."
Tears are allowed for the externalization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying because of an unexpressed theft, is that I was caught in the head by an older woman, a cold director to whom I felt a tingling
“She should never see you crying,” she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad to have caused that feeling to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in the Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for president.
“It wasn’t a very well thought-out decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “White as Snow and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind with fundraising and vowed not to enter the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000, they gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to collect money and to target voters instead of gossip.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Schroeder about the press’s reactions to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my gravestone.
“And the crying?”
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, although it appears to be a long way to the end, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a fee of between 5 and 10 percent for US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well with its books, U.S. pressure on the trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been predicted so far,” said American researcher Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia for a New York Times Center.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists for things to return to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now reached its sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit into the water to the 3rd of the hole 16 by handing it over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the replays, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament, from 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the last-place player in the European standings, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, possibly his last Ryder Cup match.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most wins, scoring an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stand it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s team work and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He hands over the staff of his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, and I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played tremendously throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they’ve even struggled.
This morning, there were a few moments when we put pressure on the European team.
I've had a tough fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us.”
