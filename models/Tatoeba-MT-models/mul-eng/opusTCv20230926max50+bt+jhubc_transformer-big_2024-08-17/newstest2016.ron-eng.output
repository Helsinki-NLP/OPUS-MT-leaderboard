UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed his regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unsolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 Figures From Surveys That Show Donald Trump Has Real Chances
Some have tried to label him as a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed that Donald Trump is driving by a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Below we present a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "happy" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two in 10 say they would be “lost” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” to 40% who say the same about Trump).
Is it the closest thing to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "depressed" if their favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t consider Trump’s temperament to be a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his offensive and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44 percent say they don’t have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say their temperament doesn’t have what they’re looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, the GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race, up from just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans are back to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say the split situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win it?
Ben Carson would beat the 19-point businessman in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday showed that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting options.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violating” in his campaign’s opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between the important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
According to a poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in the Congres, 54% declaring themselves “unsatisfied” and 21% “clumsy.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour Party, will later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for “less theater and more facts.”
He also stated that he can give up a few entries and that he is giving them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in leadership, coming after he called a “ghost cabinet” and after Tuesday’s speech at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to keep the silence at the national anthem as part of a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and held the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respectfully kept quiet" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferently" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn’s leadership team, arguing through differences of opinion related to economics, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent, Robin Brant, says the political differences are “compiling” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment regarding his position with the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes that will eliminate the idea of limitation in its entirety.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party “is very clear” in the exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “cap” level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron at the podium in the past decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from reprisals and attacks, committing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will hold his place at PMQs when he cannot participate – for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying that he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to give up the political style of "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but acknowledged a few years later that he did not succeed in his pursuit.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader’s reasoning, of how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and of his position among fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Frame in Joburg”: Youth without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child have found a way to learn a trade and earn their living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a rise in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side-victim in the “furnace” created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, in the opinion of Australian Tennis President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unwelcomely drawn into the spotlight by the scandalous outburst Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a knockout match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the seat referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated, "Wawrinka should have put him on the bench, I should have put him on the bench.
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tour, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for second place on the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But to be serious, he has mastered quite well in challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has an amazing team, he has a great family next door and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, works hard and has integrated into the team, has had no conflict with other players, is very respected at dressing, is training hard, is in excellent form, is a very well-balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to play
Healy also backed the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw that begins Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the return of the original Canberra player in the long run to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus completely on the draw and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's matured under the public's eyes and made some horrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand what he's doing, and we're trying to get him to believe it.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure lead in the Democratic National Candidacy race, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary election, the majority of Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among Democrats under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at an advantage among the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a two-figure percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point advantage in this group.
About half of the Democrats at the national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
One quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-ranked, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she’s the best candidate for the presidency (13%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him running — though a third think he shouldn’t run.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, the Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the numbers have dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage that is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, Democratic voters prefer the problems instead of eligibility.
Just like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key features vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integral and trustworthy and with solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three when it comes to integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% don’t have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as them.
With regard to all these aspects, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say that it did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was shared in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the controversy over email hasn’t affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
In particular, Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democrats consider Clinton to be inclusive and trustworthy, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider her to be inclusive and trustworthy, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integrated and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be integral and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Out of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson, and Bush are ranked first in integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in Carson’s case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brother charged with murdering the student in year 1 of Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put behind him a 14 kg backpack full of sand and was repeatedly sneezed as he tried to head towards a target on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng has been accused of headaches after which he has lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi didn't call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
But they found the time to change Deng’s clothes, look for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s president at the national level, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brother in front of Michael Deng’s good,” Wagner said.
He could not have been resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunk, and thighs.
“Many families have been devastated by the brothers’ rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family’s lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Another thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with rape and complicity in the murder.
“We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brother, officially or unofficially, we will also take responsibility,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch School banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases its interest rate.
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will rise, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history provides little indication of time frame.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalization.
In fact, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the agitation related to the increase in the interest rate was exaggerated.
“The first increase in the Fed’s rate of interest after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of “cheap money,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still lower to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an increase in interest rates can volatile things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect again the downturn in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - by about 14 percent - heading towards an increase in the interest rate Management, quite invariable over the 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last 14 per cent of the analysis of the market.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits are beginning to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 post-1950 interest rate increases, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time it’s different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates on the occasion of this meeting, futures transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all the growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super-growth cycle of profit, the GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of the bonds decreases immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these increases in interest rates will lead to an approach to profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased – all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do their majority business in the U.S. will have to earn as a result of rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that “quality” stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial rise in interest rates,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital income as well as low volatility stocks also surpassed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have to gain from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save might also have to win, although experts don’t agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for "stunning"
He claims to be more and more similar to his commercial opponent.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, claiming to have plagiarized the Brits.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is “turning into” Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it is doing something commercial jobs don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chiefs that the public radio station "stupids" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 is ‘stunning’ — although I don’t like to use the word — but I have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also attended the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are the two examples that come to my mind that do nothing but copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I learn from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new songs,” he said.
In the first half of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needs to make more efforts to attract the audience to the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the banner of the BBC to be criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for around <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and does not stand out by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show performed by BBC1 - featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find the golden egg chicken in its own backyard” the next time they launch an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking over new seasons of The Voice or spending money on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could lead to a reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the UK’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor at IMRG’s sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, the number of people who could make purchases online and could do so under various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers have narrowed down in front of the computers to put their hands on deals, which has led to the collapse of multiple retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers hit the choppers, could cause shoppers to reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as television sets and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the Bin Laden family is sanctioned, Muslims bury the victims killed after the Meccan mascot collapse
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the collapse of the macara
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a slum that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those mourning their deaths joined in expressing their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after Saudi Arabia's king sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also wounded 394 people.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a slum that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the crane when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the crash.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide the details, but said that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the mascot to collapse in the Grand Mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date security measures and not coordinating its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has been carrying out major construction projects.
The last al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade", family-run son in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased will receive one million Saudi Rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit Conversion in Swiss Francs
In the banking market there are already two offers for converting loans into lei in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to an increase in rates.
Banka Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to data compiled by FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed income per lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Transilvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk commissions and administration paid by the client, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in RON before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Beneficiaries
The main advantage of lei credit coverage in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by future increases in the franc, and repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the salary is collected.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not reassessed, additional guarantees and another proof of income are no longer required.
In practice, a new financial and legal analysis of the credit will not be made, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a reduction in the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, the equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is formed more of the dough, and the customer repays very little of the main.
The offer Bancpost with very small dobanda in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is not known how this wave will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in RON with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, to over 15%, and in a few days from 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to cover other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is paying attention to the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision as to whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will remain for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up at zero and initiate a process of interest rate normalization,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
You see, they have lost their charm.
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor was confronted with the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of these certainly have a cost.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double leg fracture in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ending with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came as a result of an unscathed intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before going to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture on his leg and is in the hospital.”
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then it will be operated in Manchester.
“It’s awful – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, faced difficulties, then played fantastically and now something like that happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the break is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It appears that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red card and the granting of a penalty kick.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it’s a fault and a red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a very unfortunate accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never aim to hit an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very hard for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious accident, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] had reached it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how hard it is to go through something like that.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's abandonment, but he's still holding on.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but having seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a traveling victory.
Perhaps Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth has left England for Test matches and has been replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as his head coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth as a team.
He played the seven Test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricketers are judged after the results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I’ve said that before – the players are their own picks.
He's fifty years old, and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance was not as good as his ability and I'm not surprised by this; above all, he's a team man.
It’s hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour – when Lyth was in top form – but that missed opportunity is in the realm of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman that I rate very well.
He is a cricketer who has the “X Factor” and whom I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up to bat alongside Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher can't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches 38 as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
It immediately wiped out three centuries ago and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age — an average of 31 at bat and 35 at ball — and might think he’s a punt, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tournament.
England also made a few changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always believed that he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is resting for one-day games, Root has got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches don’t do the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions will never be taken easily.
Brexit camp could have a win-win if the economy stays calm by 2017
Every day, David Cameron’s renegotiating strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more in jeopardy, even without the choice of genius Jeremy “Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticisms of Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that - immersed in crises similar to those in the EU - not all are caused internally - some member states are fuelled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty amendments, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they also did not want this to erode social protection.
We might even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take part in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that more ministers and officers from certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in the leadership for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation escalates, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been sitting too long.
In 2017, the President of France, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the British who are posing, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know on their skin how captivating Fleet Street can be and how sceptical are the barons in the oligarchic press who look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps I vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-deductible wallets, foreigners who cheated on the phone, and pseudo non-domes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way but realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating you lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who made friends with me back in Westminster on Monday — I told him not to waste his time with me — seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock’s “Murdoch Boycott” strategy from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It can last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution with indulgence.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the Conservatives’ “anglicism” might agree with that.
This was stated by Hilary "One Benn, but not one Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to acknowledge that John McDonnell's appointment as "shadow" minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfaithful to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay “in any situation” — Benn’s statement — does not match what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians during a private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it has also made me aware – the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the vortex of social networks, a spotlight on paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a ticket to Europe, allowing him to take good care of the Labour party in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyin’s basic sophism of EU membership – in line with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophism on NATO – Tom Watson is relentless about the fact that JC will not campaign for renunciation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin become political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I recalled at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health Department’s Decision on E-Cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted in a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
Experts from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team joined Lancet's publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed their finger at the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinary fragile base” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned the claims and their justification “on solid ground or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect PHE claims that "current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting in which 12 people participated led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were clearly presented in the abstract.
McKee and Capewell said one of the meeting’s sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which the executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT’s accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments were not provided on the basis of which the members of the panel were selected, but among them are a few "frontiers" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the work the financing of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group’s research work “convincingly mocks” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of the PHE’s health department, says he has responded in the past to BMJ’s claims.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives lose their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by e-cigarettes to health is lower compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information coming up and those not coming back from the evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion regarding the dangers relative to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that is, while the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Ads That Shame Britain's Arms Trade
Watch the film by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Horrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing the ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause blistering pain without leaving any trace!
The cheering voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a tight curtain, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, do you travel with DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the announcements, using the London Underground’s fonts and branding, the DLR line transforming into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will flock to the DLR Clients are asked to contribute to stopping the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound package of Allen keys that it says "facilitates access to about a third of advertising space from bus stations on the planet."
The London transport director is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that meets the navetists who travel by subway.
Amnesty’s film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP which worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the ad for the arms fair – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic ad, however, “riching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking.”
“They’ve done a great job of helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty International.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms fair comes from the interior of ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped focus that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
8 golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in beers and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those we’ve upset — and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I’ve learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving in the home can lead to conditions ranging from nervous breakdown to fear.
It’s tempting to tell people where you’re from, if and where you’ve spent a year studying, what you think about Corbyn, and why “sincerely, it’s Marmite to you because, good guys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deeply.
And help others breathe as well - ask questions and show yourself interested.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones to have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
The bedrooms are often full of parties with drinks, movie shows and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try their underwear.
Similar topics: Don’t even think about starting a student’s life in a relationship
Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of periphery is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friends.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to remain friends but I want you to leave to recover the energy I have consumed by interacting with you.”
Try to sit down when a colleague is exhausted from socializing – and try to send an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
Let’s talk about knocking at the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends by cooking.
Given that you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to make acquaintance and take and a black plate, it seems less weird, less like the situation of the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something for you, now I'm putting my own smile on it."
The benefits prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.
Your carers will feel obligated to talk and may even associate your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a skilled cook.
Coconuts of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
The theft of food is a frequent crime in student dormitories.
Obviously, if you wipe someone’s chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
It will probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I get it - you're still trying to address the issue more mature than my roommate, who dyed his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He's in jail now.
Don’t make noise that doesn’t let others sleep or study.
This is not only because it makes sense, but because you go on your own.
A girl on the field with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give more music.
When they stopped the music in a final, at 5 a.m., the girl was friendly and let her sleep for two hours before going to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you confused a roommate with your future husband, you got married, you split up, and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see how all your common friends are coping with him?
Of course, you can't fight your heart - but if a sexy roommate is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The moment you realize someone left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between farce and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful trick is fun, but it can denature in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick someone's goods on the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, of the "strange" right, as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who played a musically
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the foreground was the cellist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being unreleased.
Both shows, staged on the Athens stage, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists, or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as “specialized workers”.
They feel like they need a leader.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishization is based on the director.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We’re not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the side, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again,” Grimal said.
The violinist relates that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've found no point in continuing on this path anymore.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one was doing this without a director: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
“How do you imagine marketing a collective of musicians in which there is no ego anymore?” asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra is dependent on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the absence of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: " curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding to the "district of the
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is one of the “very brave”, precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present singing three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group.”
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works to his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal campaigned for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the work of the musician, as it is organized today, has an omen of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't work.
In Bach's day there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter the EU, you have good vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU, health laws had to be adopted that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music the same thing happens, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds may not be very beautiful, but when they are cut they are true reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that run this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its learning into school, we reintroduce the concerts to television and through this education there would be no need to sell musical by-products," he said.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we train a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We’re talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier (this education) it has to be in a way, if we want to train a musician, it’s completely different.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom he offered in collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an Artist at the Opera House in Dijon.

He also holds many master's degrees and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the distinction of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quijote", a violin designed for him by the French Lutheran Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year’s George Enescu International Festival with the Orchestra Les Dissonances, on the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also climbed the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the lead, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Small Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: the doubling of two characters in the super-production "The Christmas Tree 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, during the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classical drawings the emphasis was placed on the closerness of the voice of the actor to the specifics of the animated character, in the recent period, the creation of the story are also taken into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the replicas are funny.
“Children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection in which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected who will have the opportunity to give a try in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then, you have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record playing their own version of the double.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the trial: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Famous 3D" and "Albinu<0xC8><0x9B>a Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double as a character in the super-production "The Snow Queen - 3D Snowman", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 fall
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing year-round profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening bell ring.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts estimated the figure at $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The falling estimate comes despite an increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on January 4 and higher surcharges for the ground transportation of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade.
Employment plans for the holidays were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs it made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to a stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has overshadowed the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, ground division revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher base tariffs, while the revenue recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday closed down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, those responsible for policy-making within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise a key rate of interest.
Above them, at the end of the central bank’s meeting room, a mural of the United States will be carved.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s president, and his colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is prepared to be discussed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero-year 2008 interest rate in force.
Even if most of the data indicates a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds — even by a quarter of a percent.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and the main aspects they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I believe that if they were to seek an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus as to the decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg’s recently questioned economists have anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
But financial markets are expected to delay the Fed, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline on the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, except where policymakers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would pass a long time until the next growth.
On Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The storm was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s decision-makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising that the Fed is raising interest rates at this point,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision makers were to do so, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in interest rates this year despite high objections from liberals as if more economic progress were needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, job market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years, and close to the level the Fed sees as total employment.
Salary gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to meet the central bank’s annual target, the Fed’s decision-makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
The economy “may face higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared slowing China’s economy would pull down global growth.
The market has declined somewhat this month, the Dow index is now around 10% below the May maximum.
For the Fed’s decision-making factors, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate growth.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer in the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no data to back up on what’s happening in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in making decisions.
However, in reality, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
President Ben S. Bernanke’s simple suggestion in 2013 that the Fed could “squeeze” its monetary expansion has triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department at the wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has a history of over-reaction to changes in the financial market that appear to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in interest rates, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia prompted the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identification implications for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned to those declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate commission.
The last period of agitation does not even rise far to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into a situation where we fear an increase in interest rates because markets have been upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.
Are you looking for an amazing market with Thai specifics?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The open/open market/deposit in 1997 is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a high-end Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/deposit is a universal type store that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, Thai and Asian popular flavors and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious decorations and celebrations.
There is also a car area where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the colors.
If you are hungry from so purchased, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior dining area of the store (good, accessible as a price) is close to the houses and offers several cooking options that can be taken in the package.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and some items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat area is large, as is the fish area - the staff that serves will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge area of freezers, where you will find curry leaves, peppers and frozen ginger, whole breeds, fish, blood and meatballs, pork carcasses, fish fins, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and many more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs chefs, as well as families and individuals.
On the wide colors I fit both shopping carts as well as carts with fork.
The discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the house area.
Where to stay: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there are chances of the store agglomeration, there is usually no hard parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls despite Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move by Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine Channel aired from the capital following the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “crossing” of the distance didn’t seem to matter too much to Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and March last year (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference compared to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the astonishing debut of the 800 Words series starring the former Packed to the Rafters star, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, featuring a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show on his own, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night’s hearings answered with a resounding “yes.”
The X Factor show, broadcast by Seven, was held in position, with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking over from shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded hits and descents on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 5:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) saw 623,000 viewers – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's second-night audience will give Nine's silent confidence that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he was openly provoked by President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police department, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wanted its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes that began on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally-governed country for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police officers with weapons.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s," Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-reduction surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in people with mild obesity, with type 2 diabetes, may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with mild obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and mange gastrectomy – in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with U.S. obesity.
The mean BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes remained at nearly the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes mellitus cured completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus cured completely at only 1% and partially at only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood level over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” – reflected by improved levels of A1c hemoglobin – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the mean results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the manxon, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and the haemoglobin of 2,1 ribavirin (31 ribavirin) and the haemoglobin of A1c.
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery had a 29% lower chance of dying after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end the violence in the mother countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of the countries of Western Europe to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is a wonderful concern for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring true peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I conveyed condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without calling for violence.
I know that his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested handwashing in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Center for Anti-Fraud, U.S. anti-Fraud Centers have reported a 400% increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have ingested hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Fraud Center, handwashing cases in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-Fraud Centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social media.
On YouTube you can watch movies that show teens how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
Teenagers seem to have mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the scented ones.
Hand detergents with the aroma of strawberries, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallowings can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand washers in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry-flavored handwashing, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was sobbing and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital to identify signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrifying,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic wet products or napkins and not to leave the hand-washing detergent in the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting handwashing detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York conspired to poison their “bad” teacher “by putting antibacterial products in the class,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to handwashing and has banned it in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and addressed the disciplinary issue of the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths dismantles rumors of Celtic's misunderstandings, admitting that the Hoops aren't at their best but will return.
Hearts faces SFA regarding Neilson’s and Warburton’s allegations is cautious about the January acquisitions that affected the team’s unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty kick in the first half brought Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths to dismantle rumors of misunderstandings
Rumors of misunderstandings have surfaced at the Celtics, dismantled by Griffiths, who have insisted that he and his team are not under increased pressure as they are preparing to face Dutch league leaders.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters had lost interest in Celtic - because they did not fight for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer broadcast the summary of Celtic matches; why?”
Because there's no Rangers in there.
Here, we're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s where interest is headed.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and not only do the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic is fighting for its responsibilities, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen, who played in 10 men, now at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Delila said, “Celtic have had periods before and will return.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way – but we have to move on.
We definitely need the support of the Celtics because that way the players get better.
It is very important that we remain united now.
Warburton's caution regarding transfers from January
Despite comments just weeks ago that suggested he had identified several goals for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn't want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
Brentford’s former chief executive said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer one.”
In the case of summer transfer players, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The striker at Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts Faces SFA Regarding Neilson's Comments
Hearts drove 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the red card of the fund was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to heart after admitting that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "There's no need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Management Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still trusts that the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys in shape again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must be desperately tied by Hamilton Accies to get the seventh consecutive win in the league, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to a penalty kick from Adam Rooney's first rematch.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or in the league, and that has not won games like that.”
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the UK it is increasing.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the UK has increased by a total of 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in the UK at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate of the labour force in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of current employees being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the same quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force recording growth and the unemployment rate declining.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
Today, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Execution Room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came for the first time in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws closer to the cause, I am horrified by the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of available seats, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reserved seats for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "he could have formulated better", but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if they asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I won't go back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims the stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said the Stewarts were either Racing Victoria or trying to infiltrate a spy in his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack against the stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of courses and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari’s cobalt test, for which there is no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to resemble “the cover that does not reach the grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly crumbles,” Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you are trying to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to quit my coaching job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in a given interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department was trying to spy on his grades.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man — whose name I’ll tell him if I’m asked — and offered to hire him in my barn to provide information about the activity there,” Mody said.
Obviously, he considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saudry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I believe it's something personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having a spine and can pull people out of the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and give it to myself, and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might cause her to think about this variant.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It's really sad for me.
I'll put pressure on him and make him make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach grew with the long-running cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari and the elimination led him to claim that he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the day-to-day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horse's legs, which violates the rules.
It violates the rules of the course.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put his foot on the ground.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race consisting in the application of cataplasm, for which stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but they have gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
He appears to be accused of running away from the scene of the accident, not offering first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy answers the opponents in the accusations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the placard tactics used by his team as “denatured subjects” brought up by the NRL’s top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees had allowed the Storm players to "take the team to the punch" in Storm's nerve-wracking game in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with the North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that he was in favour of the league.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the placarding tactics addressed by his team and said players were simply focused on “contact” when placarding.
Bellamy says she gained confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year round, so just over the last six weeks we’ve really focused on contact in placards and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We wear it as it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animate football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's winning championship in 2010 by playing "combating" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing Saturday night’s game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he doesn't care how black he is under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they thought of the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a tougher race compared to the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more tries, that means thrilling game?
Or is it palpitating to take a break and not marching?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they have won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at the end of Saturday’s preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets being put up for sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to encourage paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone when she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages after which his mother immediately alerted him.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at the address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to “draw pedophiles” on the Internet before “claiming to be a cop to scare them.”
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: “He said it’s an addiction – that it’s an addiction to scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to become a policeman to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to say goodbye.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother and trembling and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
On June 14, Hogg, 23, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges that he had made or made indecent pictures with child subjects, and violated the conditions of parole on January 25 this year and did not appear in court on Tuesday.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender register because it can be said that the crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, on the grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearing for other files.
He was placed on the sex offenders' register before the sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but filming the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous threats of death, threatening them not to somehow evade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they ousted him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe’s speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but it is titled ‘death,’ he told reporters after Mr Mugabe’s speech.
He warns the parliamentarians in question that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 available.
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 deployments as part of the company’s restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
This year, HP will be split on the stock market into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from the operations of corporate hardware and services in a slump.
The planned deployments will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently, and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style,” Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is split, the object of which is the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called the "Silicon Valley lagoon".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Series That Taught Us Important Lessons About Friendship Between Men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the answer often has priority over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that affect our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in their comfortable photo shoots, and Ross’ passion for Rachel have come from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they often pretend to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call us don’t feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer multiple long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much it helps the objective, external intervention, through the phone, people who arrive in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re participating in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full playback of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria Marks and Helps PSG to Give Malmo Away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut match and helped PSG to impose himself in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
Below we present you the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series, with a 2-0 quiet victory against Malmo in the match played Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut match in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage though they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with a goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Joining Group A alongside Real Madrid and <0xC5><0xA0>ahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the course to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity of being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next two, even if there are other aspects that we need to improve over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home from Bordeaux in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he knocked Marco Verratti's leg behind Malmo's defense before striking incrediblely over Johan Wiland, down the corner.
But if someone expected PSG to get the win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a defense of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for the shot by Nikola Djurdjic who passed by Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
On the other hand, PSG players slowed down the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries only in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his pass being that which Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match was over, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the rejection David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi canceled a long-term goal.
Norwegian Malmo team coach Age Hareide later said that PSG were with a class over and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the stock exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57 percent of its market value this year, the company is slumping with falling prices on the commodity exchange, as China’s decline in economic activity is influencing demand and causing disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning’s trades.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns over China’s stagnating economy have led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi insists on wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needed to open up to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve its opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th Central Leadership Group Meeting for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting opening up and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
The state authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
“The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the practical right of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
The unions in education, dissatisfied with the proposal of the government to increase salaries by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and education union leaders have not reached any results, with the government proposing a 10% wage increase from December 1st to January 1st 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we’ve been promised today is less for us than we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government, last year, for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal for wage growth, following which the unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Wages Act to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act provides for an increase in wages in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase provided for in the document to be exonerated, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists to pay all of the court rulings in 2016.
The Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey’s territorial waters on Tuesday after the vessel they were in was wrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey’s coast guard said it was able to rescue 249 people who were on the shipwreck, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to get rid of war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India fired about 130 stewardesses and stewardesses because they were overweight, the airline announced last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is “ridiculous” and “sexist shock,” according to The Washington Post.
The awarding at the table is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the fuller stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardess considered "exceptional" because this "may have an effect on the reflexes and may impede the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
Stewarts gave the company a trial, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to cause them to weaken have failed,” a company spokesman said.
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A star football player gives Gigi Becali lessons on how to promote young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the Football Academy where he invested a considerable amount, the Paul Papp Foundation opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, the villages are waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it’s extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without having to worry about training materials.
They need to have only one concern: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details do not have to be taken care of.
They need to value their talent.
This is what the Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children to show them that he is with them," Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Children up to the age of 11 are expected at the Academy of the Star Fund.
The whole party wants government.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in government and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to go to government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it through a congressional decision, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that gave someone the insecurity of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
PSD has announced when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important for the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, to give a clear message if the government wants to continue or if the party decides to move into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce Monday if I will run for a post in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month if he will run for a leadership position at the future Congress.
I will sing after the Executive Committee on Mondays, if the date of the congress is also set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the objection to the nomination announcement had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don’t have the problem you will be referring to, but I think it’s fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce me or not a candidacy at the time when the date of the Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

An Italian was arrested at Bors customs with migrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted Monday at the Bors customs while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of an Italian-led motorhome.
Following the investigations, it was determined that the two paid the driver <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,000 to be transported to France, the Border Police reported.
At the specific control, border police officers noticed, in the truck’s cabin, a large suitcase, in which personal belongings were stored for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough control over the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police officers discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the highway, among the plastic cages, two men.
Two men, 28 years of age, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania, according to the investigation.
"In the investigation, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which they had contacted a national, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person," the police said in a statement.
The two migrants have been preparing “criminal work in the face of the sabotage of the crime of trying to cross the state border fraudulently.”
Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian citizen who ran a Renault Magnum trademark registered in Romania that carries plastic bags for an Italian firm, was detained for 24 hours, and was due to be presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are the Romanians in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents declared themselves "very satisfied" and "satisfied" with the overall quality of the couple's relationship.
“However, 18 percent are ‘easily dissatisfied’ and ‘very unsatisfied’ in their relationship, and another 18 percent say ‘right’,” the study concludes, according to a statement released on Tuesday by Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% are satisfied, 17% are fit, 6% are very dissatisfied and 8% are easily dissatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied, and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral (proper) state, we see a two-percent difference.
“Like in a very unsatisfactory situation, the biggest difference is the slightly unsatisfactory response where we see a 6 percent difference,” the statement said.
The study also found that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The study’s authors also reported that “Romanians need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, freedom 14%, control
The study was conducted by Extreme Training from June 1 to September 1 on 1,369 people, with the calculated margin of error being 2.6%.
Europe is once again a disgrace.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "has become ashamed" of the failure of the Brussels ministerial meeting on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
"This evening (Monday evening), Europe has once again become a disgrace," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the minister of economy in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told AFP.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested reducing the European Union’s structural funds in the case of countries that reject refugee quotas.
The European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday in an emergency, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the most serious migrant crises in Europe since 1945.

What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is faced with a crucial decision for her career, being forced to decide whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year on the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the romance only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to get in front of the sporty caprice.
The Adidas program will close by the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or whether to give up collaboration.
We still don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore, I can give you an answer,” Simona said at a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive tennis coaches in the world today, asking for a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last match that Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team in the fall of last year.
The former selector testified that he did not get along with FRF president Razvan Burleanu after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and so he made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now, I'm not sorry I left the country.
Then I felt sorry, I left a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, I did not respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions in the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he didn't want to stay, I proposed a contract extension.
We have around 400 and a few thousand euros a year, then we have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burlean, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The coach accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Shields and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police have decommissioned Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia, after the violent clashes on Wednesday, when tear gas and water cannons were used against migrants who wanted to flee Serbia, despite the fact that Ugria was a guard.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia writes today.
So far 20 police officers have been wounded and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were wounded after they were thrown over the security fence.
“We will rebuild the fence and tighten it and protect Hungary’s security by any means,” said Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control with the water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who threw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take measures against "very aggressive" immigrants from the common border.
There are reports according to which the Serbs and their forces added order to the border.
Following Wednesday’s incidents, Budapest suspended the crossing from the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted effort to close its borders to establish access to migrants.
If Tuesday announced that next to the fence on the border with Serbia it would raise one to the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the raising of a fence at the border with Croatia.
Rare disease a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was banned from his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was being bullied, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was evident that he was drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk without being drunk, I thought he was crazy.
“But friends and family thought ‘maybe he’s drinking alone, he’s an alcoholic in secret,’” he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn’t recognize himself: “I looked into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although he had doubted for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's mind at ease was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he was found to have an alcoholism three times over the legal limit, although he had only consumed one beer the night before.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, your body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who pretended this could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease doesn’t have a cure yet, but since giving up carbohydrates, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A man from South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as they agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, the "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on the national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures for the unitary and coherent management of situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible system of admission, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from countries with migration potential or who may affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighboring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of the measures of removal and restrictive measures of the national system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
Among them are: the ease of access on the territory of Romania of third-country nationals who meet the needs of employment, the promotion of access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficit.
Referring to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers it to be "a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among the EU Member States in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to expenses with the staff of the employers.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania is third in the EU to increase labour costs
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania during the period April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in the commissions: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Parliament's Culture Committees rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be discussed.
"I think given this situation, it will be done relatively quickly," Senate Culture Committee Chairman Georgika Severin said.
He added that it was "a good feeling" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was good to have the TVR leadership present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members as of yesterday, with about an hour that we didn’t know any new time, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus, we personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting it.
I believe that at the time you are summoned, you are a budget employee, you are paid public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of committees gathered even if you don’t like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under the authority of Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Culture Commissions.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
We also saw the debts as they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to date, but they did not pay off the historical ones.
"I will remind you that it is not my fault or that someone else on these committees has lost that agreement with the banks and the fissure, they are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the assembled plenary there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Minuni will not be made.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there's gonna be a genius who'll stand by here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with much reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what’s going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you should have - I feel good about the attitude towards employees because it's a bunch of requests that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you receive such briefings 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” the president of the Senate Culture Commission said.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR’s President and CEO, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he called for Parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of TV and public television.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV fee, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, with a view to updating the provisions on technological changes on a daily basis, as well as for the regulation of the control procedure in the field of payment of the TV fee and the imposition of penalties and application.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s mandate to collect the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of a maximum of 5% of the commission on income.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% at the level of 3%, but also for the amendment of the law 41/1994, in order to receive budget / financing allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sporting events, Euro Fobal - Cerona.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the coming months, given that labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judgments, even if they are not final, and wage rights are accorded priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
“This reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed,” the letter said.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"With the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to fulfill its public mission," the letter said.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The Genres of Vasile Blaga, Sent to Court
Vasile Blaga’s bailiff, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of the removal from the payment of taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specializing in security services services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which the transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, in the company's accounting would have been recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The Seiqis established the fate of Sanmartean
Al-Ittihad's supporters have determined the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean’s departure from Ittihad is imminent, the impression of former Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title match match and does it well.
The Seiqi also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been achieved," Zaporozhye told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint Senator PSD Ilie Sarbu, the son-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were cast “for” and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
In addition, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this role and announced that they would challenge her at the CCR, provided he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to make politics.
The PSD Senator will hold the post of Vice President of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him to be unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the film "Burnt", the actor made a revelation that his fans weren't expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: “I worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the whole childhood he cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, “not even two.”
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would love if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking on the role of Clint Eastwood, who became the director at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday morning condemned the claims of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that political decisions in Hungary are “nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee.”
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational assertions, swindles the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
“His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania’s domestic politics,” the head of Hungarian diplomacy added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges posed by Hungarian government representatives.
“This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; both in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!”
The Romanian prime minister added that he is a fan of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Shame, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality certainly won’t solve the problem – they’ll just look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they’re political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries that are fleeing those refugees!
“I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values – what we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these goals and values!”
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the remarks of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta “simple lies” about Hungary’s handling of the refugee crisis, saying those claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and deceitful remarks" of the Romanian prime minister regarding Romania's internal political crisis and said that Budapest was expecting an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and said is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes is a terrorist, is a fool of the Middle Ages, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we will get more, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bata and with inseria.
"I do not agree with that," the chief of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government had decided to begin preparations on the ground for the border extension with Romania of the fence it is building at the border with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary’s decision to raise a border fence does not solve the problem of refugees and “sweat Hungary from Europe”.
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca Strait?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a mascot on Friday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, an accident in which 107 people died.
According to an investigation commission, the company did not "respect safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company's directors were barred from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of al-Qaida terrorist network Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Grand Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, crashed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How he closed his mouth to the contestants
Considered by many the world's greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after retiring from activity, as a weak coach, who cannot achieve performance in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took on, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he is sponsoring.
After a year of taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he is able to turn a team struggling to save from relegation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which is beating the European Cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team came in second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equivalent to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made the future a target team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Florentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Star, Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors of the Roman Centre for European Policy.
In an interview given to Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police will not function in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the current situation".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that didn’t actually solve anything?
It is clear that the EC President, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote on the Council.
All the forecasts said he would have the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it by the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it’s a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like “the EU sends us migrants on our heads”.
They have survived, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to race again?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is corrupt, you can't say infinity that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism to allocate the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there is a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think European states will catch up to take on migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely to reach some unique filtering centers, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just started going to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard for the Mediterranean past, but we expect next year to a wave maybe even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
You speak of countries with less or greater experience.
Does it seem to you that there is somewhere where it has really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaves.
I'm not going to go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an integral part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.
But purely police means won't work.
To create a strong Europe and illusion.
We need to move on to the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
We ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one foot in their home country, bringing the rest of the family, including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we have to look at them as they swim in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take it back.
Until solutions emerge, we see strengths within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been raised, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranged the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're free to go around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it can not be so, because some countries do not make a girl.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public is excited.
After passing the public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don’t think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There will be other rules and something else.
The Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, which believes that if it pulls the plug on its eyes and sticks its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it’s not your little country’s problem.
We did that, it’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality right now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romanians for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it's probably good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entering into a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter the Schengen as migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean that it's a reason not to go into Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two seals, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated behavior of power.
She believes that being a great power means intruding on Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to fall before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
Two years ago there was a battle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, backed by the Gulf states and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a seal of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to win time.
Perhaps Putin is waiting for offers to be made, to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in one way or another things created by it all.
But I disagree with theories that say these people are guided by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now social network representatives are preparing another opposite, the “Dislike” button.
Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on Tuesday that the button will be available soon, the New York Times reported on the blog.
Zuckerberg said that the "Dislike" button will look more like a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on his account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded that they be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving Like that post,” Facebook said in a statement.
The version of a new button on Facebook has not been well received by everyone.
“There’s already enough hate on Facebook and social media,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times’ Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of the thousands coming to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary has declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania.
Massura has attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they will seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Ahead of the new immigration law, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
In addition, over 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa took refuge in Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is to be tapped.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to change the institution, stand to crumble because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
In a year and a half since the building’s consolidation and refurbishment work had to be completed, the works did not even reach half.
A final stage in the building’s era was consumed in the past days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for the works that are still to be carried out.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was going to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works was organized.
"The negotiations did not end with a contract, however, the CJ considered that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to suspend direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it could be taken into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, the building’s consolidation works could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work to strengthen the former headquarters of the Police Chest began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works for the consolidation, refurbishment and mansarding of the building were valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, I say everything!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Registry Office signed an agreement to recognize the facts, against delaying imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by former boss Narciza Nedelcu

Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the President of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's handball national team for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania’s national women’s handball team, “the main objective is qualifying for the Rio Olympics, but for this it has to go through two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament,” he said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masori, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get a qualification for some things, more specifically physical training materials, that we have never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. and I'll do whatever it takes of me to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we are in the stone age with the preparation.
“The teams we’re dealing with have these materials and have them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he’s trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within a span of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic zone in Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now there is a beauty trail.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic Games were also a success in terms of investment.
“In my vision, we can host a major competition in 2024,” Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went to civilization with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but they quickly became clear that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, we told them that we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concretely.
“So we have all the opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don’t have infrastructure,” the FRH official said.
The former great handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the women’s teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: “I have asked all coaches to be booked in the forecasts, that if they don’t meet they will return against them.”

I wish I didn’t disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with good results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
Romania national team coach Lynn Howells, who has had his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It is an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every game make Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC8><0x99>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made to the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the bottom of the event.

14 million lei given to the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The hospital "Sf. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and installation of some clinics, but also in the equipment and medical technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six trunks used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds with correspondingly equipped, an ophthalmic microscope and other apparatus necessary for carrying out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and installation of the "Great Fire".
From the money from the budget rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main trunk.
“In addition, in the coming days, we will be receiving works from the walkway linking UPU to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transportation of the UPU patient to the neighboring clinics,” the manager of the medical unit said.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tat<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC5><0x9F>i, which will organize it in the outpatient clinic, under the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where there is allergy, haematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The jar, made of laughter by RATP controllers and a folding.
A tourist's farm
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to walk in your city again.
Unwillingly, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "so says the law".
The couple arrived in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist packages.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were crossed.
"Armed" with these maps, the wives visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>ul.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they can take a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusted in the fold, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS according to the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said the two-year service no longer exists and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
I WANT TO KNOW what was written in the local press, I come one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they don't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all I can do is give us a single fine instead of 2 (me and my wife).
“I paid, I didn’t want to ruin my day visiting stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!” says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined for misinformation on the plea and the controllers who “applied the law to blood.”
It's not right, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not being overreacted by many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Ghinion for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven violators from Vaslui has moved, from yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
The judges have ruled the first term in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of beating an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the start of the trial itself, one of the judges of the country to whom the case had been handed over, Viorel Munteanu, made an application for a stay, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate was active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Pile Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted a dispute formulated by four of the defendants, ordering their placement in custody at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which are the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, in the file he formulated a restraining order and judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui’s rapists would remain in pretrial detention.
You blacks will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when you judge those who will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
Following the trial trail will take place at the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on October 6.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the doubt with which the robbers from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident produced in P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco car driver with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car that exited the Canta road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The dome runs from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>c<0xC4><0x83>curi.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport, to take over the prisoners.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other dub, the guards surrounded the back of the car of the niles, and the arrests came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the water vehicles have been amicably understood about the damages to be paid," said Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and unequivocally: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in itself, a small number, but huge in comparison with the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really want to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely low.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any color were not able to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent medical care, to collect garbage on the street, to create decent paid jobs or to keep their own generation.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are struck first by the bellicose fascination of the strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
He's probably afraid he won't steal his national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy among many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept an exodus destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken into account.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, by placing strict reliance on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But there is peace in Romania and even more comes, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy – but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchilled, disassembled and overstated construction.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but here is the fact that neither the EU has any plans for the future.
And improvisations and threats don’t help at all.
Then what is the EU to do if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed – the right to free movement – could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros per year to rent Club Pogor.
The destination, practically, imposed
The tender for the concession shall be for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the court of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful surface of 134 sqm, on two levels of roughness.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of the literary café, library or other activities with a cultural profile.

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the black of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a strengthened family in Italy, in the same year in which the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl in nursing, now a
Crina will celebrate these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and brave gift: a visit to Romania, to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, to learn about her obscure past.
"The Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Journal", which witnessed the search efforts of the family of origin after a few extremely vague clues, was a witness to these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are right moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crinai begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginosa, while she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home, disagreements began between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and I didn't know anything since.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pa<0xC5><0x9F>cani, and the girl’s father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were meant to be permanently divided.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital yet.
After boarding, Crinai's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, could not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“I thought she was abandoned,” says a family niece.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, who then gave it to care for the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years in which abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would finally move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already been doing it for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“It’s as if my wife gave her life,” says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling as he grabs the girl’s wild hand in his hand.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica, continued the searches separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but received no answer as to where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might have died, but at Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i's parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was going to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for it I no longer had.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about it all these years, but there was no way we could walk, find it.
“It’s hard,” she tells us with tears in her biological mother’s eyes.
However, even though the years have passed, Ruginosa’s parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was young when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," Crina said in a statement.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Anti-Drug Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request that we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only get one name, the Costa Rican, then the town, the Ruginoasa.
In a short time I had an activity with the town hall from there, and I could ask if there is by locality the name received.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for either.
“It took about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” said Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since they each had their home in another locality.
We started the proceedings somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided that there would be a first meeting in September," Romica Ichim added.
Over the weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their missing girl on the halls of the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i hospital 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep much.
He was still excited, trembling.
“To see your child after so many years, it’s something,” says a niece, who also comes to us with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Crina’s meeting with her biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costica Balkan told her, among other things, that if she ever wants to return to him, in the village, she can come quietly: she can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and bury him.
Mom is also excited, crying, and hardly believes that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like that could happen.
I’ve seen cases like this on TV, I’ve been thinking about it all these years, I’ve been hoping, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
There are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
“I hope we can keep a bond,” Alina, Crinai’s mother, tells us with tears in her cheeks, holding a napkin in her hand.
In him he still hides his tears of happiness, because in a short time he will see his daughter after so bitter a time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be turning 20 this month in just a few days, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
“I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say,” Crina tells us.
First family meeting in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In Unirii Square, under the skies of the beginning of autumn, the Ruginosa family reunite their fate with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but may start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first event of this kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I am happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug addicts.
But we're trying to get our societies back on track.
“If I am ever asked for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure,” says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counselling Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, goes away telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns on foot yesterday at PSD.
Everyone pulls their soul.
The camps in the PSD's outlying branch ended an armistice with a gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, carried out from Friday to Sunday, the first being even the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s chief executive, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social-Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party’s functions.
Far from being over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a pause to allow the fighters to pull their soul.
The dragon didn't give an ultimatum.
He released a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The two days of discussion over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD’s county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the party’s foreign branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, County Councillor Vasile C<0xC3><0xA2>tea and Interim President of the County Council, Victor.
The mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, may also be added to these.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be applied, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new leadership structures," C<0xC3><0xA1>tea said.
Until the internal elections, the management of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, the wolf is on leave until September 29th, the preparation of the elections to be practically ensured by the branch’s executive secretary, County Councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
By telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in order to support a uniting team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions of the candidacy for the PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i presidency, the list remaining open," Stanciu said.
A judge from Issei refused to file rape cases in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people in Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
The convicts sentenced to between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments about their release, after the court of law, the Vaslui Judiciary, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making an application for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in this case.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Judiciary who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
The court finds that after the moment of placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, the restrictive measure of freedom but not the deprivation of freedom, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, their families and local supporters, has been strongly motivated by a strong strong sense of jutism at the level of the local and national community.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
"The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the accused wanted to highlight through the defences they formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many wonder to what extent it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
The declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (at one point asked NATO’s Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was otherwise regularly invited to comment on the political events of the war by the TV channel’s Marussian
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden to be a real tragedy, ISIS is close to being preferred to the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the ones he said and promised and Tsipras in Greece up until the moment he busted with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic program of the new Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renationalizations and printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted around the world, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who would prevent such details from happening again?
Of course, we can tax the bankers in blood, become some sort of enemies of the service of the left, but as seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Holland.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncompromising promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher put it, “The problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the party's fresh leader, sadly failed in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant across the workforce, and extensive automations have made the industry massively need a high-qualified workforce, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shakes the foundations of the EU, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide, following the referendum, to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep gaps created within it by the Euro crisis and now the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, to the place.
All the more so for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin became increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the country’s stay in the EU.
Today’s Europe is no longer the same as in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I had just recently a sample in Jean Clude Junker’s speech, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under the conditions that electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative-loaded emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
What is the Financial Times’ conclusion when assessing the chances of Brexit?
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make a brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will witness a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by deliberate decisions that have taken only integrationist political ambitions into account, and not the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent and the tensions on the continent, the tensions in the EU will prevail.
And it's hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our top political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
He said, “Take and kill the workshop.”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him in all the world.
Behind his fame, however, is something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name, too.
It's called a "trude."
What to write about Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the notes.
And, recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brancusi has been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the grown-up, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brancusi."
The country is engrossed in its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is enormous.
Neither did the Communists manage to remove it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes today feed the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else can I say, write about this man?
Watching from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brancusi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you haven't been lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family as strong as it is, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however hateful they are.
Look at the success stories of idiots, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he heard a whole map of the world?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in the municipality of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj county, on the foothills of the Carpathians.
She is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i.
Although he came from a family of fortified peasants, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one of them has to pick up his references that will guide his later artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places in which he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have been leading a happy patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, Brancusi’s childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor’s years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A Biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i was three years old.
In the fall of that year, when the vat was made "la cazan", following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brancu<0xC5><0x9F>i caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palm-trees with gauze and drinks on the breathless.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
Mother panics, then hysterics, believing her son is dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by cheers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul at his mouth.
The party immediately turns into a jam.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds that it is good to call Baba Br<0xC3><0xA2>ndussa, a doftoroaie and servant of the Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncusi.
The snout checks the baby's breath, then puts them under the horse's bare nose, collected nearby.
The kid's a strong-willed kid.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep on his drink, for joy, the party with cheerleaders continues with more and more strength.
The next day, the father and son meet through the meadow.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i makes Constantin collect some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child with his head down and, with the nudges brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that things around him can turn out to be twisted.
Especially the position of the sun, different from that of the well-known, makes him wonder, as he was supposed to acknowledge in old age, if not the star itself participates in his disturbance.
“Had the sun been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?”
At the present time, the city is not functioning.
A member of parliament calls on politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient its agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big disparity and so on.
I haven’t seen any of the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you can only see how politicians dispute their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's let go of politics a little bit, let's get together and talk.
At the present time, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He estimated that the current political class has disappointed the Ishean electorate, the consequence being a very low attendance at the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the party "Pentru Ia<0xC8><0x99>i" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very low chances and will only make it break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"It's getting worse and worse right, which is not good for anyone, not even for PSD," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He said he was not interested in a bid for the upcoming local elections, dismissing rumors about his intention to enter the race for mayor.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am still thinking about whether to continue as a member in the future term.
I tried to appeal to unity for Ia<0xC8><0x99>i and in the talks on the halls with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to take a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
“If people have voted for us, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid to vote for us if they don’t see anything,” said Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B>, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A colleague from Tat<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC5><0x9F>i said he couldn’t get the money and had to take the bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
There's not much money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the money from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I will make a report with everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the employees in the office and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other discounts.
“To say a parliamentarian that his money is not reaching is pure hypocrisy,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> concluded.
