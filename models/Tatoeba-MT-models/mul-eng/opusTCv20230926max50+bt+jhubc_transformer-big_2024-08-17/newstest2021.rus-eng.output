In Mexico, two states have declared alarm over Hurricane Hanna.
Mexico’s National Civil Defense Administration has declared an “orange” (high) level of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n due to the approaching hurricane “Hanna,” TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring strong rainfall to Mexico, in some areas predicting a drop of 150 to 250 liters of rain per square meter.
Authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
To help people will be 10,000 people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military.

Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: the cassation of the former Deputy Mayor Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made at the beginning of September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to consider Semilarski’s claim, but in April his cassation complaint was accepted by the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant on December 12, 2019, as its authorisation is not within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court order stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the district court should settle such issues,” Annette Kreitsmann, ERR’s press secretary for the Tartu courts, told reporters.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the court's decision of the first instance.
Now the Gossud will have to say his word.
According to defender Semilarski, sworn attorney Oliver Nyas, his client about two years ago was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery.
Now he demands that the prosecutor’s office reject false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for submitting the complaint to the court was the statement of the Prosecutor on the special cases of the Lebanese District Prosecutor Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another at the time Deputy Mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of misconduct.
“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the Tartu leaders, one of the most influential bodies of local self-governments, were selling.
These air-suspended public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office doesn’t want to say anything about it,” Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyas, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The claim about bribes and sales turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that, at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words so that the suspects are not represented in the role of criminals before the sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” he said.
"The public view of Semilarski as a serious offender and constable in circumstances when the facts underlying the suspicion of conspiracies are still being clarified is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and unfairness in relation to the statement," the statement added.
According to rus.err.ee, former deputy mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held responsible for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated in private time.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to get away from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor’s office has presented Semilarski with suspicions of receiving bribes and violations of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At the time, the prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officers resigned.
Suvorov’s case later came to court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial in Valvo Semilarski's case is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage point to 4.25 per cent per annum, a formal historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short rate cut, as well as the tonality of the ECB’s statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimisticly than before.
This means that the current cycle of mitigating monetary policy could soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, first of all, given that the risks of declining inflation from 4% in 2021 remain,” said Elvira Nabiullin, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The restoration of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, the construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, the annual rates of reduction in the turnover of transport, transport and transport were slowed.
According to the Central Bank’s detailed forecast, in 2020 the economy will be reduced by 4.5-5.5% (previously expected by 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the forecast of the Bank of Russia on inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% versus previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of mitigation, economists in Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko believe.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it to one percentage point immediately because of the low rates of inflation due to the depressed demand and the need to stimulate the slowdown due to the pandemic and its related economic constraints.
Chances for the adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agreed the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The set of pro-inflation risks also points to the nearness of the pause in mitigating interest rate policies – broken supply chains, possible cost growth due to epidemic prevention measures and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he says.
In order to complete the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to the inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, on the mortgage, says senior economist of the analytical management of the bank "Opening" Maxim Petronevich.
The rate adjustment will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he said.
Interest rates on receivables may fall by an additional 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end a year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist "BKS Primer" Anton Pokatovich.
The average rates of contributions, according to him, will also fall - in the coming months they can fall to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
They can then go down to 4% if the central bank lowers its key rate in the fall, Pokatovich said.
The Central Party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year
This was told in an interview with the ERR by the Secretary General of the Central Party Mikhail Korb.

Earlier it became known that the party of the prime minister returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a forbidden donation.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of Ust-Ordinsk Buryat district
During the working meeting held today, 24 July, the Government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agrarian areas.
During the working trips in the areas of Ust-Ordinsk Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their execution.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orde was resumed.
The order for this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been able to move from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
The deadline for completion of construction is 2022.
And already this year the school in the village of Bayandi should be put into operation.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises is completed.
Of the remaining works - improvement of the territory.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district, in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - noted the cry of the Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to be actively involved in the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a general plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage objects, - stressed the head of the region.
Also during the conversation was raised the problematic issue with the reduction of milk intake in cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution of milk by the reprocessing enterprise in favor of cross-farm farms.
Because of this, the share of product intake in cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the incumbent Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of the implementation of milk, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

The authorities of Podmoskovya told about the fate of closed dumps
In Podmoskoye continue to close the landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the government promises to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing in the field of dumps are being modernized into modern waste-processing complexes.
But such an option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have grown dense residential construction.
After the polygon is closed, it rises to recultivation - the body of the polygon is resuscitated with soils, degassing systems and drainage of the infiltrate are installed.
This allows to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not cause starvation, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to rise to a useless pile amongst the clumsy of its residential construction.
Why not do something useful for her?
For example, in Ruze, where the recultivation of the “Annino” polygon literally ended the day, the authorities are considering an option to make a pile of ski slopes.
This polygon, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land under it.
Therefore, when recultivation had to buy out the neighboring areas, de facto already littered with garbage under the bandage.
“Some time will pass, the polygon will ‘sit down’, it will build fortresses, and we’ll think what can be done to get it started to benefit.
Right in the eye - a ski resort", - told the journalists the head of the Russky district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
Polygons "Torbeevo" in Lubertsy and "Timokhovo" in Bogorod district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from shale and biological gases.
On the territory of "Torbeeva" by the end of the year will be launched a gas-fired power plant, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide its own needs of the polygon - heat supply.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue its activities as a waste treatment complex.
And at the Balashino Polygon "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints from residents on the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of the polygons of Podmoscow," - said the government's spokesman - Minister of Ecology and Environmental Use of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful tall minarets just decorated Aya-Sofia
Once again about Ayya-Sofia - got the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, if necessary, must be protested.
First of all, there was a free entry - ura!
I was not in Istanbul, but in the House of God is better free entry than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oxo interriver, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help me!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give it all back?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will need to return their chapel, where the Tenth Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it funds.
That is, it belongs to the Lenins - Putin and other nomenclature - in the same way as the factories and estates that the Lenins have chosen from the bourgeois into their own property.
They’ve improved everything from the Kremlin to Ankara, so that’s all their progress.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very.
There was a stupid blacksmith, and there was a stupid blacksmith with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hinges that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the opinion of a British Foreign Office official, Toynby, who believes it is a shame to think so.
A place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he is removed to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're cobblers, not stone crushers.

Kirilenko shared memories of games with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) Andrei Kirilenko shared memories of his games against legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in the National Basketball Association (NBA) matches.
I knew that Bryant's self-love couldn't be tinged with some sort of tress, so as not to stimulate his sporting anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk him out so that he didn't perceive the game in an aggressive key.
On the platform I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Koby, good shot, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that you have to take the ball once again and score another 3-4 points.
We had a good conversation with Kobi,” Kirilenko said in the words of “Evening Moscow.”
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I cared for him.
The first three minutes of the game I ran in complete admiration of the fact that next to me was a legend that I saw only on TV.
As long as I'm happy with my breath, Michael's got a lot of glasses.
Soon I got away from the fascination, covered his cheeks a couple of times...
In that game my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points,” added the head of the RFB.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz Club on the 1999 draft under the 24th overall number.
In addition to Yuta, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
A total of 797 matches, in which he averaged 11.8 points, made 5.5 selections, 2.7 assists and 1.8 block shots.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko will nominate his candidacy for the election of the head of the Russian Federation.

The interim governor of Khabarovsk region Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with the residents of Soviet Havana was surprised that the region is buying Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
U.S. gas is legalized in dollars until 2025.
"To be honest, I didn't know that, and I'm in a knockdown like this because of this information.
I had no idea what was still possible in Russia in 2020,” RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The governor also strongly stressed that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to the supply of Russian TPPs and capacities, which means that the Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used "at normal prices".
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product division agreement, where the project operator with a share of 30% is Exxon Neftegas Ltd, another 20% at Rosneft, the Japanese Sodeco - 30% and the Indian ONGC - 20%.
Khabarovsk region has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations in the "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chicago", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the claim to the film.
The authors "understood the sharpness of the themes raised and didn't want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with Rise.
“I think it’s a story about strength and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of the boy, who changed into women’s clothing.
He said he was "proud about the job" and did not consider it to be propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is afraid of the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case where "a man in a deep trance shot the shooting platform and said it was all untrue."
“Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came with the claims first started to help us," he said.
The shooting, according to the publication, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of a shooting group with weapons, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public authority for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Roskomnadzor to the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main characters of the film are working as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "stages of physical and psychological violence".
The ombudsman also angered the fact that "a lot of attention is paid to homosexual sexual orientation" of the underage character in the series.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
