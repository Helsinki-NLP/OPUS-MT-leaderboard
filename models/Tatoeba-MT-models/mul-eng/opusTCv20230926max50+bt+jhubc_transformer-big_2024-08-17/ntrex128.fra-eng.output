Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Welsh voters are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group is concerned that the sign “rimes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non- Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfactory" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, stated that "the final decision regarding the appointment of the members of the Assembly belongs to the members of the Assembly".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that Macedonia’s name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
According to him, it is normal for bars to be rarified.
Today, “we don’t get to see each other the same way anymore,” he explains.
“Before, we went to the bar as if we were at his neighbor’s house, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before those responsible imagine it, and this worries him: “Early or later, they will return to the starting house.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely Whites who will rush the closure of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching in the vicinity, took possession of the building.
The Church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks were struggling to get employed or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon.
Father Johnson’s son and successor in the direction of St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor people.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played in July, gave her a completely different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the larger carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, there has been much debate about the refurbishment of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose on him the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a lobster fishing game
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing at the lobster, in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been diving with friends since half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming with joy that he had a seizure, and then he realized that in reality he was
had been bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
“I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water: There’s a shark,” Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
During a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicates that there are more than 135 shark species, but that most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's makes low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and packs them with ray similar to those in the supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while fashion and home items sales are falling, more extensive beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to up to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their purchases online and to head to nearby stores for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will look more and more like large surfaces, as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel sales of consumer goods and make acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the ray of pharmaceutical and cosmetic items in the British chain had resulted in a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end following a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies established in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the framework for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den TV show star Peter Jones has announced the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decoration brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and accessories Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
At the age of 37, this morning’s host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, furious by retiring from their successful textile and interior decoration activity at the last minute, to devote himself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling child revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the trading empire of the star of Dragon's Den in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth 1.5 million pounds of truffles, were no longer allowing him to walk away.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the fortune of the estimated hostess to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to a source, “True was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It will ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities from this morning’s animator could cause the company to lose millions due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of resuming it.
In addition, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; 52-year-old Jones joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couple went on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an animator of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was horrendous, but we finally loved each other.
Trump joked about the media criticising him for his comment that some consider him “innocent of a president,” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”,
He railed, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
“I didn’t give anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday not to see any “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
We have fought the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there’s hardly more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been declared, a condition required for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they made it clear that they did not want international help, which makes things a bit complicated,” Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, she still doesn’t know if fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shaking, the country is desperately lacking in means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refuges have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have been heard in Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has put infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable money to re-establish roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, which is expected to represent itself in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends at Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to sit back, take the ball, but players like Shaq are always pulling as far as possible, so I tried to make the most of my time,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward cut a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before spinning towards the midfield and sprinter side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick go-and-go in the middle of the field,
then carried out a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard into the surface.
Hazard exceeded the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of victims of the tsunami is 832
The disaster management agency said on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami account for 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 07:55, a 44-year-old woman with a knife stroke was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents in the area who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
I particularly call on taxi drivers, who could have picked up something on their dashcam and asked them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they were informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, police not allowing anyone to enter or exit the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confided that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
She said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cord.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact the Failed Crime Agency at 0800 555 111, register 247 of September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His ban would be the just return of things, in the light of the acts of destruction, of England's countless religious and cultural goods, committed by its puritanic supporters, such as fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick’s proposal “unreasonable” and called it a “revisionist attempt.”
Cromwell Society President John Goldsmith states that, “Given the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s statue erected in front of Westminster Palace was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or lead the Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration given to him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.”
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated.”
China: A Pig Kills a Farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery torn and covered with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject swine vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby piggy bank was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig responsible for Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and allow police officers to collect evidence.
The family of the breeder Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig ran a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to drive it away.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are animals rather than players.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause setbacks in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1) from 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical north-easterly humidity in the U.S.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the impending depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfalls between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden landslides, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The avers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of the conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rains could turn the canyons into uncharted rivers, and storms will produce wind gusts and dust swirls in places.
The impending depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some parts of the country’s southern California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris flows and make the foot slippery.
It could be the first rain of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical avers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall in all four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
This sometimes leads to a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will undergo significant temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm beginning of October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be above average in the eastern United States during the first 15 October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels on Thursday, the gripping hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcast services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theater coup: an agreement envisioned by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had turned himself in and tried to remove her clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate twist, also claimed to be 100% sure that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or as the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have widely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC took second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken in part by protesters while he was trying to take the elevator to go to court hearings.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN relayed the sequence of the live interpellation.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor.”
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast network channels covered the live session a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, as the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance sheet, as Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making ‘small politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of her plan to leave the European Union, to make “small politics” to the detriment of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a cover photo of Theresa May, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, saying the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “quite ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police arrested a fatal shooting suspect who led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was also stabbed and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton-Red Parish Legislature’s office released a preliminary report Friday, which determined that the death was caused by a bullet wound through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police medical-legal laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “engagement and their quest for justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grows up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said the team was "devastating and in shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
“We’re always afraid of this kind of event,” Wade said.
Mexico: an ash-cracking volcano
The ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano after recording a peak activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several tremors and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the approach of the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Excavations also broke out later in the day, while police used mattresses to contain clashes.
For several hours, groups in favor of independence chanting "no forgetting, no forgiveness" faced Unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters who had minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was ruled illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions remain high in the independent region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout rate, opponents of the secession having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a rally in support of the national police.
This was still the case, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a big moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock,” he laments.
Despite their slim, capital victory in the regional elections in December last year, the independent Catalan parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for having held the referendum and declared the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on the one hand and on the other.
“Tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several times darkening over a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car had also been shot in the head.
Livingston wins 1-0 match against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently upgraded, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current head coach of Ibrox's club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place second in the standings, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of a Premier League away win this season, and are due to face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Rapid de Vienne on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she is extending her 6-match winning streak in the division, and her head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may boast of not having yet lost the least match.
Livingston has missed an opportunity in the face of emaciated opponents
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before scoring, as their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained entrenched in the opposite goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them through hard-working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a goal from the midfield.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was only rarely concerned.
The second half had the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Ranger guard Allan McGregor stopped a kick from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to defuse one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were rejected by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the summit, but the merit largely goes back to Holt for having motivated a team since its arrival.
There are many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the air throughout the match.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they have not been up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and managed to break through the other side only once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the picture.
Mitigated welcome from President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Calling for security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocracy by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescuers arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Officers Injured in Riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Specialized riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 inmates and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-riot agents were sent to prison to ward off a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is probably what will happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading to the southwest desert with what is left of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecasting as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the depression or tropical storm stage in a 300km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border. . . .
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central area of the Rockies and the Grand Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to sudden flood risks.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona experienced at least one extreme category of drought, the second most severe category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast, in the lower California Peninsula.
Always of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds that can reach up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Storms of rain are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal sudden landslides and landslides in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) on the night of the Radstock side.
The officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been a victim of the Democrats’ malice and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democrats’ malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, energizing and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” that day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I fight on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party employee's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of victims, the balance does not stop rising
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake has preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jatakar.
“The tsunami did not arrive alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami had moved in the middle of the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, noting that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” La Croix Rouge said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building frantically shouting at passers-by on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water was cut off on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to transport aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami has soared, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Members of Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in the basement shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices. Along the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to help the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, relatives of the missing still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a small boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paraglider team coach Gendon Subandano had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an old man in the paraglider discipline, I experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I don't think they've ever received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when recharging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle was living a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a purse for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leave the premises, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is kindly requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now known as Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Previously known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West, who has been known as Ye for some time, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled her arrival for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, citing the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I passed from Kanye, which means “the only one”, to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union line and the majors.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by awarding monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double Funding in the Field of Artificial Intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research funding in this sector, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for research in the field of AI would be a good start, as all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we’re looking for the next big discovery in AI,” Lee explains.
Double funding could double the chances that the next key step in AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best-ranked American Othello player. He then joined the Microsoft Research management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that’s appropriate for academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. efforts in AI.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Affairs Council unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academia partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, for its part, is currently investing more than $100 million a year for AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
The Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked the application for membership of the EU and the EU.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: “Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 per cent, while it had reached 34 per cent at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66 per cent of the voters registered at the end of the vote.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, joining NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments, with the unemployment rate in the country exceeding 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his bulletin.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is less than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian chain Telma, estimated the participation at 57%.
70% of the participants who intended to vote said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes a road through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before evicting the others very close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the Premier League match,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-party against the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took him 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game doesn’t matter, we want to go through the pitch in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals are yet to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the spot in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be training Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
Washington's right-back is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 points earned on 220-yard touchdowns and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation he generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I fight on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take back power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“You can see it in the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats people “angry, mean, and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public ouster.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party’s Momentum movement voted to censor me, it wasn’t a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all because they have expressed our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received identical treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe; ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That was exactly what Friday night’s general meetings were like during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into account.
It has become clear that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy's takeover, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share a similar political vision started to expect me to return my jacket and take positions against my convictions, whether it's about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive social media thread, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling myself that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political in nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flurry of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted through motions of distrust and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so strongly, and everything would go well.
But this is not to act as I do in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are working or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the Nottingham East constituency.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Remains Invincible
Two late attempts may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only invincible team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are captured the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
“So far, we have been tested, but we remain invincible, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
The 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers. Jason Baggot did not hesitate.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, right at half time. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long wait ensued due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recapture, Ayr took the lead with a trial by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's acting captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed test by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team took over, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo when he didn't have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit Ayr's back, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the replay, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away winger Gregor Henry for the fifth home team test.
Still Game's Star Launches in the Restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in the restaurant business and was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s famous show, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his long-time stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the finale of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "floating dining environment" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will pave the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling in an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto: “The sea returns to us from the right.
Receiving it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present, as is the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades; Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile be required to negotiate the agreement on a sovereign passage.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that few things will change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years have perhaps even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents to date - used the maritime problem as a political bait.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must break away from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Only Take Place When It Can Trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not defend itself from its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems about to re-launch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after Singapore’s summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it’s “chimeric” to think that maintaining sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will cause the North to fold.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness as to the renunciation of an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal the Latest Headwear Trends, Maybe Soon Available in Your Shops
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of dazzling oversize hats during a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
All the more extravagant hats each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to incorporate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's headpiece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad edge evoking a feather, which engulfed the model's head.
The other oversize accessories included jewelry-matched patties, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, with tuba and glasses, while the other made a cone of melted ice.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to the style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the trail of the "Bomb", the broad-board straw hat that the stars take off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, adorned with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the masterpiece of the show PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent test results reinforced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school program, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and establish a trusting relationship with people from other countries.
If we look at the excellent results of this year's reviews, we find that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most significant success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72% of students received the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills shows that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to skills in insufficient languages.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of his or her competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not master enough foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020s, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what their future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make its debut with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are chasing LeBron James’s debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairs, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to gather support for the upcoming midterm elections and avoid Republicans losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the issue of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's hearings, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans win the field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five meetings aimed to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential element of his program that the president will go to as many states as possible at the start of this campaign,” a Trump team spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, this evening’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is trailing in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope on Sunday’s simple approach
After three simples, Saturday afternoon ants could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The balance movement of the momentum is a sporty concept invented from all parts but which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
“They were driving six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a little of the wings,” Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can boast of getting three out of four points each.
Spieth proved to be extremely effective from tea to green and gives the example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed, and a crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth, while Thomas and his team were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, through which they won the match in the 15th hole, sparked a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in the running.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the Ryder Cup history.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to the error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to perform a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd derailing them, designates them as players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and the Swedes into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Forks and ants are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can flip in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made considerable progress over the last day, but this ants session has also proven that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-seaters.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressing Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Although determined to retain the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made the difference by scoring 3-1 in the morning’s matches, against a disorganized American team.
The U.S. demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to resorb the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 Sundays on the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they coutured the pair consisting of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of a 5 and an even more categorical 4.
Woods, who played both games on Saturday, has shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning fours, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning the 2-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, number one and number three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, during a cool but clear time.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, only had to make a draw to keep his trophy.
After being seconded for two days, however, they may not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament will in “no case” be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would strengthen his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organization’s Annual General Meeting, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing site, and failing to commit to nuclear testing and failing to do so.
“However, we don’t see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticisms of Washington’s opposition to a “step by step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it was gradually taking action, its statement proved to be significant in that it did not reject the idea of unifying it.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore during the first summit between an acting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the security of the North Korean peninsula that guarantees Trump.”
North Korea sought to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the “declaration of the end of war.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us cry don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.N. leader highlighted earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If the party involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization would not be in the peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after the “malicious” President Trump called the “suicide” man Kim.
Trump, who had threatened last year before the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not give praise this year on the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea was lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean president, Kim calls for the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Resting Courses <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight the growing machismo trend that consists of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most of the world’s best university students don’t know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why am I told this only in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Distinguished for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of stress.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, according to us, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of the pride of “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure exerted on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of infatuation, causing them to faint.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all third-cycle students a similar degree program before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students anticipate an alarm for both bedtime and waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal drops Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record their first moving win since their 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team at the helm, eight points behind the Hepburns.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third position, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 that drew a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team smothering his opponents at each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored by two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and his team collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a blow from Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the middle by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last moments, but McGregor struggled well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow passed the goal.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was playing with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURIST... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can really hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it’s sure to jump, right there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists in extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to “learn” them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Sheathed by a MAGA hat, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was huddled on the board after a slurred performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for the 2020 election.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West grabbed the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times, I talk to Whites and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’
“Well, if racism was my concern, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was released on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind due to his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a vault,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see him, the snitch?” and claimed that he would wear his Superman cap, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
“Try the love.”
His comments attracted at least twice as many from the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the spot told the magazine: “A silence of death has fallen on the whole plateau.”
West had been called to replace singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disappointed a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU TO THINK YOU ARE TO THE PEOPLE.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and casts a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Fire Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Charged With Attempted Murder After White Gun Assault in Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The heads of prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his fine-lame role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has taken the stereotype of the male hero, saying that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to be turned into hard cooks to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he said “something is wrong” and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star, admitted he was “firmly” committed to tackling the issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have mismanaged masculinity.”
“What lessons have we given to young men who become adults, compared to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they have to behave like this in order to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something that’s going on.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he finished with “the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character lover Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of its people with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised, since 2003, universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed senatorial data, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by “extreme right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was put online Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the White House’s former press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he or she has not done, he or she must not be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accused.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the authorities and services responsible for enforcing the relevant laws” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, undercover spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his cheeky eyes and rubbery face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who runs a small note in The Fire Trucks at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, he was also inspired by the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two pleasant moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter as he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly hitting his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when “serious” licenses like 007 and Impossible Mission compose themselves in complete confidence with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s bluffing misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetually topical premise is that Great Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great dismay of the agents in service - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character at the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to put under the den.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice treats here, because English offers a spy academy the way Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets Bough, his former long-time partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create big troubles for Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of bluffing jokes: under the guise of servers, they set fire to a French restaurant bursting; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta’s luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a family home, to steal the virtual reality headset.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite all, there are not many things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, like the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having drawn up a plan for the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week — but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the artificial intelligence (AI)-generated economies by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to reach the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.”
“This won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour Conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back into the hands of “anonymous administrators” and “beneficiaries” in utility companies.
The Deputy Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their stake as the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private enterprise capital to employees, which will tax up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy confide in “60 Minutes” if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes program correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s vote appears to be engraved in the stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old business.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive array of stars and invested in an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true purpose, namely to put an end to it.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness among the population.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clitivism” – a situation where people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, of which a slice of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed to "helping children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda a <0xC2><0xA3>35 million grant to end malnutrition in this country after receiving more than 4,700 messages.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a 2018 London concert.
The group also said that following the company’s more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will achieve this because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists to perform this year in New York, where Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could call on the Navy to create a "block" to curb Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” appeal to the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – particularly where it operates at the legitimate government’s request – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, make obstructions to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “Energy Consumer spokesperson” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less about the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia, while saying that it has “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump said makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin asserts that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said “I think we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supply.”
The U.S. position has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of running in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of running in the presidential election following the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy to the presidents.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should appear in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University and Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent names of Democrats for a potential 2020 campaign include those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin Discusses Track Palin’s PTSD During Donald Trump’s Gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can relate him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and certain injuries that our soldiers come back with,” she told the public at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a taboo subject” and said about his son and other former fighters that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for Wasilla's police department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a marital violence report and possession of a weapon in a state of ebrition.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memo in favor of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs” had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” said the curiae friend in his memoir.
Lawyers have also argued in the memo that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems – even the most serious – that people encounter every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her frail little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center in the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back the bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going into their homes destroyed, picking up wrecked goods, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a back and shoulder fracture, rested in front of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent responses.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, noting that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘intimidating’ by ‘propaganda Ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad extolling the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary election, an accusation that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters of states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubled economic trajectory, as the media is firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating voters as they approach midterm elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28th, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be measured,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction could be live if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “it has become a confusing disorder for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, it’s about Kavanaugh’s nomination, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats.
Following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority leaning on the latter’s side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of people surveyed absolutely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they absolutely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations advanced by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of sobriety at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as those authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said jokingly that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on a contract on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in discussions with “Facebook and Google” to find out whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely switched in an instant.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I Churchman Decorated with the Cross of Victoria
The only Church of England ecclesiastic to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and taking in three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I will never be, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band-led parade.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main chart, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were sidelined when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have remained awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation has that at 6 a.m. this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program flipped, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more to the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘lower’ in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but this instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a several-month leave due to her illness.
Appearing as a navigator on Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, these feelings of being lower and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask a larger number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give back “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed that he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you see so many things at such a young age” – he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said he confided that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he was dead so that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That's all I've dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her first choice of song – Proud of Heather Small – which had accompanied her during preparations for the Olympics and always gave her chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
An out-of-form Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get up to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's squabbles and squabbles.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has been so often for the United States, the quintuple grand champion shared his day between the role of supporter and the refinement of his play at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He was never the greatest of the managers, even at the height of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the wrong shots.
And as if the course wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, take a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games ever played.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never fully reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to laugh at people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves with him this week, which was fun to see.
It’s more than just playing.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a remarkable advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danes played their first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but ultimately stood at the top of the standings with the shortest possible gap on the finish line, winning it 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You can’t stop reminding yourself that we were going wide at Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as Valderrama, where we won, but rightfully so,” said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Ranking to win 5-6 at the time of the sale.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep into it tomorrow.
Go there and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you have the points in the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that’s what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Enthused by his players’ performances on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual performances that will be presented and it’s going to be different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re put to the test at the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message to pass on to the players, it’s to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go and get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day reversals, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe pulled the win.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys like we thought we had to do, we’re trying to do the magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his selections in simple terms.
Germany's new warship still delayed
According to local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating to the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the all-new frigates of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery issues have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class that the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the warships - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless in case of deployment on combat mission.
The defects of the software were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the flaws of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property in order to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will help to determine the frequency of bat cries as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be drawn up to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perchors and results in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as do fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perchoral inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only reserve of bats on the Threave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threadave, we have an ideal place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without wanting a single nest of motherhood, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and small ones, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to bring her help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “false information,” and said people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations aired, Ronaldo, 33, called this information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to make themselves a pub using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is going well,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they called an “unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in proportion to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations of recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player’s room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had had sex, but that the couple agreed.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this settlement because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged attack, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State in charge of Trade, the UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in post-Brexit automobile construction.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tension flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota but other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
If Toyota was not able to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite union at the plant and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House announces Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “rejected for a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser in charge of investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump’s associates and Russia and the possible obstructions to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will return the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in front of which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press attaché, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we postpone another week given all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion for the “demagogic” television reporters, although she said, “I don’t mind the fact that they’re tearing up the gallery.”
Then, she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Not to mention evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well over the past few weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on their own.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On fears of Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that comfort and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State's Sselon Mike Organ, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-in-command, was rushed after a head injury Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before halftime.
“He arrived at the touchline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for another examination.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris said there were "no details yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and purchase-locations - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and prevents primo-accessors from making a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who stay most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using them, he invited Ms. May to waive the affordable housing quotas in order to settle the “real estate disgrace” that prevails in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of “no fault”.
He also wants to give councils more extensive powers to build new housing.
Mrs. May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my post as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a house as it is for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland’s technician, Jack Ross, explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish selector at some point.
The 42-year-old is pleased to take up the challenge of re-establishing the club in the North East, which currently occupies the third place in League 1, three points from the leader.
He competed at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I used to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches in Hampden with my father and that’s something I never forgot.
This opportunity would only be presented, on the other hand, if I succeed in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland selectors are Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to stay behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured by the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, this one belongs without a doubt to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably not consider myself a success here unless I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa rise from a relegation to a third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the sidelines of the relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The taking over of Alloa “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it well, that I made a good living and that I took advantage of some nice peaks.
But sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to fix every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canicule has raised the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has put pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but revenue in restaurants dropped by 4.8.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s boardroom, which compiled the data, said: “Permanent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup made July follow the June model, where bars had seen a 2.8% increase in restaurant sales, except for the 2.8% increase in restaurants.
The drop of 1.8% recorded in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that go down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent over the month and food decreased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales on the off-home market.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in annual average sales of 4.8% is particularly painful, in addition to continued pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the norm in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some of whom are just 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 – open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “false Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they managed a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to capitalize on his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh has immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and who is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a trying job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!

Online, an ad on milkshake that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online ad from a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
To mark the launch of what is called “the world’s first silent milkshake,” Elvie, a large-scale technology company, launched a bold music video-based advertisement to show the freedom her new milkshake offers nursing women.
In a barn full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I live myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you hadn’t noticed it, it’s my breasts, not nipples.”
The chorus continues: “Pump him, pump him, I feed the babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, I help the women betray the milk.”
However, the advertising, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s an understandable trauma for the mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added, “A commercial so disconnected.”
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman admitting that she found the song “hylarant.”
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms who take their milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘wolves’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal having danced with the discreet milkshakes hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milkshakes say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milkshake is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milkshake will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie is doing one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have settled quietly in a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies that have made it difficult to place children in responders.
Traditionally, most of the respondents themselves were paperless immigrants, and they were afraid to compromise their own ability to stay in the country with the help of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a judicial record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are respondents or members of their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case in respect of their legal status before an immigration judge.
Non-eligible persons will be promptly expelled.
According to the speakers and reports presented in recent months by the refugee network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw on the ground.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and that millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom form and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground.
Moualem said about the refugees, that the conditions were favorable to their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have announced that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as long as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces backed by Russia.
Moualem pointed out, however, that the agreement provided “precise deadlines” and expressed the hope that military measures would target jihadists, particularly Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution", and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
It would be “the most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings at peak hours have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have practically tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in high-definition hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
“It’s a matter of attracting people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic book author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory for his part.
She recalled taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, contrary to everything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade affair, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself looking for six hours at a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the vest made of leather, and with the postage of "Autumn" by Paul Mana.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing gives the impression of watching a reality TV show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about changing teams and turning back on Trump.
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the ropes.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was doing 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was on the inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand down, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were encouraging all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district was flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of congressional districts that allowed two incumbents to contest the same seat.
This district of the Pittsburgh suburb, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency during the special election last spring.
Lamb is being measured by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrafted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district sparked a clash over the funding of election campaigns between major party funding branches, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a win-win by-election last March during a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. planned to penalize Salvador for its support of China, then withdrew
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which Washington has little opposition to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to convene heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only expected against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, notably to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, perceived as an advance in the efforts to immigrate to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the history
The next canvas could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Trump’s justice, and the public record is now backed by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the issue of conniving Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to report to that body, as he prepares to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “ifs”, and I do not claim that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had held its head and pushed the Czechoslovakians back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these splits and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these splits.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to record the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is confined to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump for accounts?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who has in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the swastika-tree table.
With this legacy, I can’t be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienne on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive no-win match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
An injury to the knee deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to pull the best of such a result to make exploits.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game thinking about getting something and we went back with a point.
We might have been able to take it to the end, but overall, a zero match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind and triumph.”
Women can no longer sleep because of this fear of their retirement savings
Even though the participants in the survey knew clearly how they wanted to be taken care of, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance industry.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions on financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-back value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your estate – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as you go through.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you are hit with a disability.
Think about the little details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but who are the doctors as well?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air gun as he walked home from an evening.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and police launched a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the balance is expected to build.
With communications paralyzed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coast to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific's seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people have died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned on suspicion of marital violence, violating a report of marital and arrest-resistant violence, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he reportedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in provisional detention in the Mat Su detention centre and is held under an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it's safe" when his plea was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to a prison term of up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and of possession of a weapon in a state of sobriety related to the incident.
His partner claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after making a link between her son’s violent behavior and PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake has caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are in a state of disrepair and the victim balance is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami unleashed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who has been eight victims – a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was reportedly using a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, paving his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to lead to the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for “a thorough preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian de Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The southern district of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing acts of conspiracy and espionage to the USSR during the two years that followed the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he had been prompted to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh’s flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to seek prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the people’s army” during a rally at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative back-and-forth MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham’s march that the UK “would have already been freed” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma facing Ms. May to reconcile her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its program and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He felt that Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not surrender to world wars to submit to us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favor of the release, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us vote first.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.”
“Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should be led to “feel the pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to trick Brexit and we’re telling them today: “We’re not going to let you get out of it like that.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have flagged conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives over the security issues surrounding the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
“It is they who assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running in the presidential election.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation that it could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman head of state.”
Arrested after Sims' death by bullet from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by bullet of basketball player Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department took part in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody for the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a two-meter-old who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to the world title after team guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by outscoring Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and knocked Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the peloton’s tail-turning turmoil, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands one lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel drive action that saw the Ferrari driver leave the inner part at odds with the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speeding arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get one or two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were “evil, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
Seeing the disclosures and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received the letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial doesn’t seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday evening at the rally: “I’m going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president made it clear that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the malice, the mess, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Elite League defeat Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants have opened the score thanks to two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer returned the advantage to the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two camps, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer gave the advantage in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a well-charged first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the night towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalised with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the victory to his team by scoring a fifth goal in the midfield.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people who were on board a plane to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were taken missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, sparking a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the violently shaken tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt that it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to swell as many bodies were still under the rubble and a large number could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after the crash of an airplane in the lagoon.
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that was leaking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships took part in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane was beyond the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the plane's rescue came from sinking.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and cried, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said Marines working close to improving a dock had also taken part in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on land before the plane ran in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The indictment adjourned his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis e was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he “was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's SMS, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped him out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What Is Political Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins in political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reunite with its roots and make hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NEW YORK: New York’s Newborn Woman Suspends Couple in Court for Retirement After ‘Racist’ Text
A New York nanny pursues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates the prosecutions into an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay at seeing in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black on her arrival for her first working day.
“NOOOOOOOOON ENCORE UNE NOIRE,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gag, "uncomfortable", Plasco-Flaxman sent Ms. Maurice back, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is pursuing the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her dismissal and claims a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust him after he had done him wrong.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been unfaithful, even if it was by mistake?
Your new-born?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to an "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
“Would you prosecute someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to replace someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It’s really fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s enormous success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children’s book inspired by a small plush bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication had a “sweet-sweet” flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save his life.
“Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to get out of it,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly running out of control and getting out of his system.
She had died a while ago and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
“No one was aware,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning file postcards to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from delaying their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room.”
However, he left his job before he died, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid that there’s a training effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go see and to whom you can talk, even if he’s a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, has lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have any visual contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma to them, but they must get out of it: “It’s tearful for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh set in motion as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in scope — we might be able to bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall into a deadlock.”
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to cast the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: The number of deserters “falls” under Kim’s direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs claimed by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of the North’s deserters will ultimately be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that have so far remained pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broadest terms, to work in favor of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied, with emotion, the allegations that he allegedly sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh proved very emotional and at times failed to scream and drown by evoking his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations about him “gross and coordinated murder” organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he is discrediting himself with these statements and the way he has dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's eventual decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation of charges hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh elucidated the question of the possible overturning of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and she can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we’re upset,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person to whom she was talking, when she was getting angry and crying: ‘You can think that I’m cheating.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an excuse for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a men-dominated office, where I once found myself crying inexpressible rage, was that I had been caught by the skin of my neck by an old woman - a cold guide who had always been in my way - a cold guide who had always caught me.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’ve had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a maturely thought-out decision,” she confided to me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the league, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had slowed down in fundraising, and so swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give her $250.
“Do they believe I am entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and targeting voters, rather than the sexist - it's all about the suffrage, and it's about the delegates.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press’s reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first saves from the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, hitting customs duties of 5 to 10 percent on 60 billion US dollars of goods.
China has pledged to equalize the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon wane.
To back Washington is to surrender to the demands, but to surrender publicly in front of the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can establish conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or the other of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia, told the New American for Center’s Security Reflection Group.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team crossed the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in trouble during most of the tournament, pushed his start in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was dismissed 5-4 by the least-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help it,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We've got to lean.
We have been overstepped.”
