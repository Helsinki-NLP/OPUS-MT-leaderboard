Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white shirt
He's a charismatic.
The Masses of Saints on liberation and healing carried out by him are being carried out by the crowds.
He was only a few years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, others are experiencing it.
At the feast of the Mass of Saints on liberation and healing, the crowds gather.
Once came to him the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors were surprised: “The operation is not necessary, the wound is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator have already begun to experience as a teenager.
In dreams, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
“I was awake at night and committed to praying for the dead and those who died at some point,” he said.
He also experienced the presence of a bad spirit.
And he had a vision of what was going on with the man who committed mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I have lost human characteristics and I have begun to take on the appearance of the animal,” he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he could not get a voice out of himself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him his salvation.
“I was immersed in the waters of a river symbolizing the baptism of the saint, I was freed and returned to human form,” he says.
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
The call was growing in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In the sermons, he wanted to not only talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Restoration in the Holy Spirit
In the healing Mass carried out by his father, Witko participates many people who count on getting rid of the disease.
The priest, however, emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (September 26th) on the afternoon of the Kolping FRAC team deserved the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd row LOTTO Superliga Tenis Sto<0xC5><0x82>owieki.
Jaroslaving in such a personal set, as they presented with the groceries, have a poor chance of winning with the sovereign leagues.
He's probably shown this in a fight with Dart Bogor.
There is still a lack of team leader Chen Jingqi in the team.
Perhaps with him in the composition of jaroslaving would reach the third in a row triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han may not have grown up to win with the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The Hellady player was the biggest single star in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both in the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was the class itself.
After three singles Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an emotional, fifty-year battle – Pavel Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There was still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han did not face Badowski.
There will be no further research for seniors.
Why? Why?
According to Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski’s announcements, a program of free preventive research for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Certification.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was badly hit.
“Further actions can even affect the detection of individual disease units, which can contribute to the deepening of difficulties in access to NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positives,” the study concluded.
The decision of the resort does not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it’s just about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in quickly detecting diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that running specialists say, ‘Don’t worry, there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I’m not surprised that there is a health service in this state,’” he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break any agreements that have been reached so far
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements made with Israel if the country’s future government tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise to annex the occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, comes to implement this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas said, under pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – not important, what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in action for the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the president of the Palestinian Authority said in a statement.
Netanyahu, Israel’s current prime minister, has once again been tasked with forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and plan to include all Jewish settlements in Israel across the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold a general election in the Palestinian territories during the session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one was in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call the local elections in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," he said.
In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, considered a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of “all-powerful members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations in full respect.”
Israel’s Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “will focus on the UN’s efforts at Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than fighting calls for terrorism under his leadership.”
However, Danon, as the agencies report, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers Want Defibrillators at Neural Points of the Mind
The history of border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The voivodeship Emergency Preparedness Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be located in the city’s neuralgic points.
For their attitude, the officials received congratulations diplomas from the Voivodeship Emergency Preparedness Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officials of the Tax Customs Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On 28 August, they performed a service at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medicine. The customs and treasury official noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian traffic zone.
A Chinese activist has died in prison as a result of torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the wife of the activist, called on September 23rd the secretary of the communist party from her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In Cao's coffin, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood,” she says.
“They didn’t let me take my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of policemen around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressed for a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for companies in the video game industry from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding goes to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was the development of a platform for the creation of land-based games and the development of a platform based on an AR game engine that creates a real world map together with an application enabling the transmission of data by users; a platform for the testing of land-based games.
The objective of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already reaching PLN 300 million of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev”, we read in the communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
“Incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs investing in innovation, such as B+R relief, competency improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR drive the innovation activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive competition, the Ministry of Finance”,
The head of the science resort points out that innovation money not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from relief for B+R in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deferred costs related to B+R activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million of savings for companies using this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.
The Director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of submitted applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“I am particularly pleased that among the projects outlined – as in previous editions – there are projects on solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also related to the industry 4.0,” he adds.
In GameINN’s third competition for funding of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The competition budget at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information on the results of the III GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented within the framework of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs affiliated to the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event took place on 16 September.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, learned after training that his watch had disappeared from his wardrobe.
It's not worth it, because it's worth $70,000.
The angry Dane the next day did not appear in the classes, explaining the problems of the stomach.
From the beginning, it was a mystery.
The players in the dressing room have private safes at their disposal, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to the AFP news agency, he eventually confessed to the theft of Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to give money back to Dunczyk for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He came to Nice as a thirteen-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven matches this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper “L’Equipe” – the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has started disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of the infections, you need to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumnal infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for the washing to remove enough dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us are washing them shorter!
It’s enough hot water and plain soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even cure them).
When washing, we wipe not only the bottoms and ends of the hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (connected or single) – wipe them with colliding movements of the interior of the second hand, the space between the fingers (swipe your hands, patting your fingers on the back of your fingers), the thumb – like a thumb on the thumb – like a thumb
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands) wet hands with a towel, and then use antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, from 5 z<0xC5><0x82>).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or the door with your hands (recommended by the General Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them through a paper towel.
Iran's president says he has rejected a proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran has not held talks with the U.S. side during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite a U.S. bid to lift the sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Iranian side had asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the United States has proposed to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in atmosphere of maximum pressure
Iran’s president said he did not agree to hold these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere”.
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he had been under house arrest in France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran will not engage in talks in the atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the end result will be,” Rowhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and the European sides of the nuclear deal accused him of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" to establish dialogue.
“If we manage to overcome this precondition and if America takes away sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He said he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that it was he who rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said “no!” tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 Iran deal, which they were signatories to.
In exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran will abandon its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector will be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the U.S. from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has come out.
Washington is using the tactics of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not get permission to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Warsaw Voivodeship Administrative Court and the husband of the late Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of judges, was reinstated on Wednesday for sentencing by the NSA.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and therefore there is no basis to support Wojciech Mazur’s management of the WSA to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, initiated a court case against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not so far been turned into a court case against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take the decision of the president of the WSA within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about his wife’s mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the Heiter group was removed from the office of the KRS, will return to the judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of Polzeczpos.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the Heiters' group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for the falsified screens and the words of his wife, with whom he divorces.
The same is true of the other judges associated with “the caste”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll bet on theirs.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not turn a finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, it is also silent about the contents of the phone Emilia Szmydt, who stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police did not turn their fingers to secure the devices of the people they identified as stalkers in a February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no case of Smydta, there is no case of “Kasty”.
There is also no case of NIK boss Mariana Banasia about renting a stone house with suteners and hiding income.
The CBA shall verify its statement of assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Committee on Business Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission somehow came together to make a curious decision about the withdrawal of Banasian deputies and the appointment of Banas as his lawyer, although it does not call on the court to do so).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American one, I think, about how my wife comes home and stays with her lover in bed.
She's so surprised and confused that she can't cross words.
She stands at the door of the house, and at this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And her husband made a bed.
When a wife regains her voice and screams: what is it going to be?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Except that in the case of "Kasty" or "Banasia" there is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.
MAXIPIZZA: Signing with the current auditor of the agreement for the examination of financial statements for 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The Management Board of Maxipizza S.A. informs that on September 27, 2019, he signed an agreement with the Company’s Premium Audit Office in Pozna<0xC5><0x84> with its registered office at 1/1 Czartoria Street, registered under the number KRS 0000540136 to the register of entrepreneurs of the National Register of the Court of Appeals of Pozna<0xC5><0x84>, in Pozna

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the break of the native player, the bronze medalist of the 2017 London World Championships, defeated 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and in the second 1.92.
1,94 managed to get it only in the third approach.
"I'm happy.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I’ll have to jump better technically,” Li<0xC4><0x87>winko told Eurosport.
The best finishers were Vashti Cunningham and Karyna Demidik – 1.94.
The two players were the only ones who didn’t hit any heights.
The women's top jump final was scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in the hospital in a severe condition
He went to the hospital, and his doctors described his condition as severe.
You need to add that he is conscious and aware.
“We believe it will come out that he will win again.
We are all praying that he will return to health,” Kornel Morawiecki, a close-knit person, told reporters at Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father will run for Senate.
“The closest family and politicians are keeping me alive,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to the Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been taken to a military hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have a yellow one.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...”, the father told the prime minister.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any transplants.
I don't know if I'm going to have chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of doctors of specialists who are rather good thinkers.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be okay," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with SE in January.
“If I had given up too late, it would have been tragic and I would have already said goodbye to this mess,” he added.
Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w: 14-year-old missing
Officials from the City Police Command in Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osy.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked to contact them.
On the evening of 26 September, she left her place of residence and has not yet returned, nor has she made contact with relatives.
The last time she was seen was at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec street in Krakow.
Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blonde hair and blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in blouses, grey pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of O<0xC5><0x82>awski jumps.
The title of the relationship from amateur sports, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the Hippodrome on Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, may be misleading for some.
To the true power of the road is far, but this name is called one of the types of horse competition...
The competition for the power of jumps is to overcome by the rider and horse of the ever-highest obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long and still unbeaten world record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
No one jumped so high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, but the result of the best local Amazons at the level of 135 cm is not the worst...
The competitions organized by the undisputed Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS “W siodle” activists were the showpiece of the earlier “Ta<0xC4><0x8D>ice equestrian competitions”, about which we write more widely in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons, who trained riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>aw JKS, entered the competition.
Four of them competed on the horses, and four on the big horses.
In the first group was best written Nikola Szo<0xC5><0x82>dra, reaching the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic rumak started from overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with a top beam away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three further refusals that the competition jury dismissed him from further competition.
The second place in the bunny jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, reaching "Famy", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> at "Harmiderze".
The youngest contestant in the tournament was Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small "Carmen" heels.
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting amazon and the spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The terrible-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, reaching the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to “Lotce”.
Fortunately, in addition to the minor bruises, neither the Amazons nor the horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" foot on the park was reached by Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach, or another horse for a pair, behind which she was a little crazy "Wineta".
After calculating the obstacle from the park, she was also going full of praise, so it was dangerous for moments in the boxes and at the recreation hall. "Everything is under control!", calmed Jan Sienkiewicz, a bit frightened spectators, especially those younger ones.
Since the beginning of the competition of big horses, Marta Masalska has been writing excellently on the park, reaching beautifully presenting "Whisky".
This decent jump, paired with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at the moment.
After a while, however, the same height also included Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotce".
So all these contestants left together for the decoration of the flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, and finally, together with the Amazons on the huts at the pace of Radecki's march, they made an effective round of honor, ending it for the interesting and emo.
THANK YOU
The Sports Club "W Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th "Destiny Races": the City Office in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the Water and sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the County Administration and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko breaks away from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Mariusz Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal, in particular, to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Mark Jakubiak, or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had been reached, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself failed to even collect enough signatures to put together a large number of signatures.
Kolonko has now announced on Twitter that he has completed his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect from the W/W KWW to draw my name out of my name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the aforementioned entity,” he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, in the US, reported on the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running Max TV’s YouTube channel, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid stock exchanges, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party's programme included issues related to the judiciary (should be selected in the general elections), tax bills (compare of the tax-free amount for all), military reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO), details of
A few days after the announcement of the formation of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately did.
UBS: Gold near the point of equilibrium
“The euro rate will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economy in global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations to maintain a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for stabilizing the gold notes on the current ceiling,” says the expert in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are mitigating the policy.
“As long as the gold is properly valued – the euro notes should be kept in the next few months in the vicinity of PLN 4.35 – Polish bonds are so little attractive in his opinion.
Significantly more profitable returns than Polish papers offer bonds from emerging markets,” says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation to emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world’s economy.
“The global slowdown may be deepening, but there shouldn’t be a severe recession, and at the most, a drop in GDP dynamics is just below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should be wary of global actions that could damage the lack of prospects for resolving the U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Europe should be relatively the weakest among the stock markets,” according to the latest letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management’s managing director, Haefele.
“Actions from euro area countries should behave worse than those from the US because they are more vulnerable under the conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowing down,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term, and only short-term, papers should no longer fall due to the mitigating monetary policy of banks.
The Fed’s biggest downside is the Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency over the next few years.
The long-term balance point for euro notes is the $1.29 catch, which would mean a 19 percent potential for strengthening the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed’s feet, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
“To maintain the dollar’s strength in the long run, they may not allow deficits on the current and budget account,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
The report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundesweh has recorded the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition – the result of a confidential set-up made in the RFN defense resort.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have so far been re-measured.
Among the military equipment, which is still missing, are: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 lufts for MG3 machine guns are missing.
Concerned about the situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left Party, Martin Renner.
As the RND told reporters, the number of missing pieces of weapons and ammunition is “terrifying.”
All the more so that as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment could be found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “poor balance”.
She also criticized the fact that it is not clear whether there is also a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the state.
The officers were accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians with extreme right-wing and racist incentives.
His “blacklist” of goals, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stif Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally into possession of four pieces of firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a feature developed in terms of people for whom traveling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the line allows you to check the layout of the seats on the plane.
If a minor is travelling to the second year of age, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place remote from that occupied by the child.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The “child icon” will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if a change of plane has occurred at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with the help of noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
“We need to learn toleration because we’ll soon need maps of seating for mouth-breathing, sneezing or drinking people,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another of the Internet users noticed that he was once bothered by the crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children on a 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca Counts Losses After Travel Office Bankruptcy Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come on vacation to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook’s travel agency on Monday.
As the representative of the Balearic Autonomous Government Marc Pons said on Friday, of the 25,000 contemporaries who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected contemporaries, who due to the fall of the British company had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during the November-September period, the losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already begun negotiations with international operators on “Majorka’s market entry” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are laid off employees of Thomas Cook's Palmyra office.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with Thomas Cook’s announcement of a fall in many Majorca hotels, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional fee per night.
This situation was experienced by, among other things, several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday several dozen hotels in Majorca had ceased operations at least until the end of October due to Thomas Cook’s announcement of bankruptcy and the company cooperating with it.
In turn, Friday’s Diario de Ibiza newspaper indicates that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza, which have cooperated with Thomas Cook’s group, do not intend to close the docks in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would appeal to the government of Spain to support the region in the amount of 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most injured on this archipelago of tourists, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook relies on local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 of about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's Rankings.
Poland remains at 29th place, USA at the top
The women’s national team of Poland is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
At the same position, the team of coach Milosz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous, July set.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were the Americans, who recently defended the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were scheduled to start the away match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning, it has been over a year.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualification by meeting with the Spanish on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, the “White-Red” will play two sociable matches – October 3 on the departure from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of Polish rivals are the representations of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the bars with the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
Poland’s men’s representation in the September FIFA rankings fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog smothered the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are nil, and the coal stoves will climb this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the first page of today’s “Republic”.
“So far, 82,000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air programme for funding of a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 decisions have been positive.
Accepted applications total over PLN 915 million”, says "Rz", referring to data from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only part of the costs incurred is returned from the program.
The results of the program's predicted grim evaluation of the diary as "moderate".
The self-governors, quoted by "Rz", endure the defeats of "Clean Air", among other things, in too large a bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic filing, sending of invoices by mail, any occasional verification of implementation.
This would improve the operations,” says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski.
Activists from the Polish Smoke Alarm note, however, that in the first year, less than 1% of the established goal of the exchange of 3 million climbing boilers was realized.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and Water Management for this year, PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved”, we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35s to Poland.
“It’s one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but it’s not the end of our work,” Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard in order to achieve the most favorable price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has 32 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets produced by the Lockheed Martin Group.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The statement said the investment will support national security and the foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairers, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and program support and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by the Lockheed Martin Group is a single-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multi-engine fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing, and typically hunting air combat missions.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the hunter is undetectable for near-range radars.
Recently, the F-35 fighter bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
The purchase of U.S. warplanes is also to be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie versus the stereotype.
Category: Dolls
Producer Barbie has introduced a series of gender-neutral dolls to the market.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Producer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with a different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" are wearing wigs.
Children can then decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe is made up of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
They also abandoned the emphasis on characteristic sexual characteristics – the sex dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a thin waist or – in the case of Kena – wide arms.
The company believes that children don’t like when their dolls have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuits and high heels, has been repeatedly criticized for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes,” such as unnatural body proportion.
The Group has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes to the market.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club together can have several dozen members
Zandberg asked on ZET radio how many of his party's candidates could get to the Sejm from the left-wing grouping list (KW SLD from which the list is started by the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), the result said.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good because we feel that people are hopeful that the Left is not only right but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberga, the left can have 60-80 members.
“This may mean that the club or the club together will have several dozen members.
But it depends on the Poles and Poles.
“I’m not going to guess and tell you how it’s going to happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left will have a separate circle together, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think the Polish people have won this diversity because we have shown that by different means, we have been able to agree on a common programme.”
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that his main beneficiaries are the centrist and left-wing voters.
In turn, given that the SLD will receive the full subsidy, he replied that “the aim of the political party is to represent its constituents”.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the run-up to the Senate election, he said he was considering it.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th congressional district, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I guess I wouldn’t try to give a vote to Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the citizens of the Republic of Poland Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa has been opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque could hold 30,000 worshippers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a member of the Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, handed over by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Ways to Paradise") comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, revered by the faithful as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15 thousand faithful, and the second one can stay on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant cranes and decorations hand-crafted by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the gmah still has no comparison to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million, was financed from private donations.
In addition to the land, the government has founded lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.5 million.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, only ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a win, the players of the Crown will try to break in a Friday meeting with the extra-class vice-leader Silesian.
“It’s not our problem, it’s ourselves, we have to work on what we’re playing,” said coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The players of the Korona last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when they defeated the 1-0 beniamin of the matches of the Rac<0xC3><0xB3>w Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa on the exit.
Later, they scored two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bia Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I’m optimistic that in the last few seconds of the match, the footballers were fighting for the goal, they wanted to make it.
Their fall to the wall after the last whistle did not result from a break-in, only it was a fall of anger because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he noted, <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has very strong wings, which is why he will feel the team playing in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” he added.
In Friday's game in Korona he will certainly not play a pause for the excess yellow cards Fire Gnjatic, in the picture will also be missing injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
The building, on the other hand, is to register in a cup match several players with a desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it will not be, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the passes of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in extra-class anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
In the last few weeks we may not show it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," he said.
After nine rows of extra-class Korona with a five-point result, it occupies the 15th position.
The <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has collected 12 more and is placed in second place.
Friday's match in Kielcach will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe.
“Forty-two percent of tree species in Europe’s woodlands are at risk,” the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in its “Red Book of European Trees” on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and jasmine.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are the trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
According to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book mentions errors in logging, accelerated urbanization, too intensive cutting of trees, and, in turn, forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, moss and pears is also highly endangered.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and create in Europe the danger of the extinction of important and underappreciated varieties, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” he said.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
“Today, PiS wants to repurchase Poles, offering them for freedom a loan distribution that will have to pay for future generations,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with the Republic of Poland.
He said, “The whole PiS policy is a pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has the idea of overcoming the Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
According to him, the opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski party.
“Today, people of conscience who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has distorted its values, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the president of the Civic Platform also pointed out the basic principles of the electoral program KO.
“First of all, nothing of the data will be collected, but you need to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, what can be seen at least after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “removing the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work faithfully – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetina explains that the KO program included a project, which will give the least-earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more-earning ones – even after several hundred.
The politician also noted that he did not want to run for the post office.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were litigating with the opposition to the broadcasting until the country's financial collapse finally occurred," he said.
Schetyna in an interview for "Rz" also stated that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidaw<0xC4><0x85>-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We’d be using their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“The dog walks before the fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a man of the state as Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is crystalline,” he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the platform’s presidency.
Argentina: The Six Dead Condors of the Great
Six large dead condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Condoms were most likely poisoned by a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxin.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss for the environment because the condor needs to reach 10 to 15 years in order to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we’re losing a protected species, a endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental protection organization.
“I think that the use of toxic poisons and poisons not only puts this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he added.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on the awarding of the head of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dude’s office – we read in the “Republic”.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" reports that soon such a chain could hit Andrzej Dude's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Petitions on Wednesday voted in favour of a proposal for the renewal of the Orders and Denominations Act to restore it.
The newspaper says that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the heads of state.
The Senate proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it passed by a single vote.
This time, the work is urgent.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would reach the President’s office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition," the then-Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office has replied to us briefly: it is for this to be restored,” said the head of the commission Robert Mammatow of PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He submitted a request for the adoption of legislative works, which the Commission supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to ride a cruise.
The political action will be carried out, among other things, at the intersection of Al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski and Al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
Uniform actions have to do with the recent complaints of the city’s authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave appropriately at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive actions “Transitional crossings” in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w.
It is about eliminating the difficulties in movement: getting on a cruise without being able to get off, not applying to light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone on the crossroad, and we really make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president.
His words were echoed at a press conference at the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of improper car movement after crossings, which in effect creates cork.
At the time, the president appealed to travellers with a sense of direction on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write text messages while driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by the riot police, who are starting the action “Transitional Crossings” from today.
What's this about?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of the limitation of transit at crossings by drivers entering on them without the possibility of continuing driving.
It is a frequent violation, which contributes to the strengthening of the difficulties in movement and the formation of cork.
He is threatened with a 300 z<0xC5><0x82> mandate and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to the non-application of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, the late movement of the under-signals, the free passage of crossings, and the leaving too large distances between vehicles.
On which cruises will be carried out?
M.in. on ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellonianska; al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego from ul. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski; ul. Targow<0xC3><0xB3>w from ul. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square from ul. D<0xC4><0x85>browski or Hetman<0xC5><0x84>ska ul. from ul.
This type of action in the capital Podkarpacia will be held on the next Friday of October.
Checked the company for the disposal of waste from the "Czech Republic"
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Officers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski County and the District Inspectorate of Construction Supervision checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the sewage treatment plant “Czajko” in Warsaw is being disposed of”, he said.
Inspectors from the village of Volomini<0xC5><0x84>ski carried out a check at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Trade and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", by virtue of a contract with the capital waste treatment plant "Czajka", performs waste management services.
“The installation inspection was carried out, and the contractor was asked to provide documentation related to the activity carried out by him,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be forwarded to the Voivodeship Inspectorate for the Protection of the Environment in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Transie” was carried out by the Voivodeship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was established at the time that the company did not carry out samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, nor did it have the results of studies of established municipal sewage facilities from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka”.
After the control of the WIPO, Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage treatment plants from the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant.
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal on the production site, waste up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in the forests around Zielonka.
The Warsaw City Water and Sanitation Company reported on Thursday that STUO<0xC5><0x9A> was shut down from operation at the end of November and December 2018, which was associated with damage to one of the combustion plants.
According to MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of the export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawy-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” the candidate of the Civic Coalition replied to the prime minister, the leader of the list of K.O. in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now “only a glimpse of retirement”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa on Friday in his office at the Gdansk European Solidarity Centre.
The son of Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw, also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken on a difficult task," said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are well known to all of us.
That is why there is great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support you as much as possible,” the former president said, referring to Kidawy-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked her for her support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important this is,” she said.
Let us show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you made your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
Kibic and Retirement
Wal<0xC4><0x83>sa in an interview with journalists said he is now "only a pensioner".
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to this) we will return.
The triad of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we need to get back to normal, and I believe we're going to do it this time.
Because if not, we are waiting for the street criterion,” said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“That’s why it’s so important that the Poles go to the polls, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” said Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of things in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to build a new foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes to be made in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no triad of power, if the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and lead to it becoming obvious and so that everyone will know that otherwise Poland will not move even a step forward.”
ME networkers: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
In the hot area in Ljubljana, Polish netizens competed with the Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The White-Reds lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws.
The Senate passed without amendment the law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the law on the property of the families of state officials – without amendment – 14 were against, three abstained from the vote.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments, which were tabled during Wednesday’s debate by Senator P.O. Slavomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had the law to "civilize" and limit the scope of the information given in the statement on the property situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in the common household with a dependent person.
The Act on the Disclosure of Property of the Families of the Most Important State Officials, the project of which was created in the Prime Minister's Office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, Members of the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, shall be obliged to inform the authorities of the place of residence.
The Senate also did not propose an amendment to the law on flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for conducting the Central Register of Flights.
Under the bill – without amendment – 55 senators spoke out, 12 were against, four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight “executed on an official mission”.
In the flights, the president will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the president of the person.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight "opened to carry out tasks directly related to the full function".
The Act also specifies a list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations on board the aircraft, there may be members of the delegation – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
In accordance with the law, in the event of any doubts regarding the flights of the Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of the KPRM will be asked to explain them.
If such doubts are not clarified within the specified time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate office of the lack of the possibility of organizing such a flight.

The Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish netizens held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a bronze medal match on Saturday.
With the support of Vital Heynen, the road to winning the title was closed Thursday’s defeat with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
There was a rumor about their trouble with the trip to this single.
This time it worked out without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went to Paris with the Slovenes charter, and a few hours later they did training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the reports of the people present at the classes, the trainer of the world’s masters was undernourished.
As Heynena’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the practice of networking elements themselves.
"We went to the hall, but in the decisive majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two words, we are disappointed.
We always thought we’d get back to this game.
We talked about this match with each other in the squad, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out inefficiency in the attack and much worse than the usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect,” he said.
According to him, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the crowd supported by the loud and numerous crowd co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little smooth road to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have been able to analyze this lesson more quickly and then we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
“It’s just a joke,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat to the Poles will turn into aggression in a game of bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true faces.
There's something to fight about.
We recently won the ME medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country to be visited by the Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: Cruel punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on starts and a fine of $25,000 – in a half-year suspension – for nagged words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players lose patience to Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most unscathed professional tennis player of recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a lot of fines, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a hefty athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working out for a long time and has made a world record for tennis – he has had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the card and next to it.
Rumorous curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and spectators, breaking two missiles during a losing match with Karen Chaczanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 to be paid.
At the 2019 U.S. Open, he did not play for long, but he managed to say publicly that ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a couple of weeks gave the aforementioned verdict of suspension and suspension.
However, he was forgiven for the words of corruption after listening to the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
In justification, however, the tennis players reported that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost continuous violation of the rules that he had violated in a non-stop manner the vulcanized person of the tournament.
ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately refused to execute the verdict, ordered to meet several conditions in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specializing in solving problems of athletes who did not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as the Lavera Cup tightened his barque injury, so he had to give up the nearest starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
Gus: Poland is getting better and better
According to a report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday, up to 44% of households assessed their material situation as good or rather good.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2 per cent, in 2016 it was 33.5 per cent, and before – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30 per cent.
In total, 8.1 per cent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 per cent a year earlier and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of people working on their own account.
In this group, 70 percent of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.
On the second run, there are domestic ranchers’ farms, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst known is the single parenting offspring, of which 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst of its material situation was assessed by the parents alone, raising offspring and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best evaluations are made by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Then there are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, the regulatory income (i.e. after payment of taxes and contributions) was less than 94 per cent of the national average, and in Lubuski 98 per cent.
The highest incomes were for residents of Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent).
On average, in Poland, the administrative income per person was PLN 1,693 in 2018.
In real terms (after a correction on the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3 per cent compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits spending growth.
These in conversion per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7 per cent.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person actually increased by 1.9 per cent, and in 2016 by 4.3 per cent.
Research on household budgets suggests that the statistical household currently spends 70.1 per cent of its administrative income, while in 2014 it still exceeded 80 per cent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 per cent.

U.S.: Three suicides among flight crew
Three Marines committed suicide last week on board the USS George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy's Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and the earlier in November of 2017.
According to CNN, all three of the sailors were shot dead last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush landed off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties in the case has been excluded.
In addition, death should not be associated with each other.
“There is a need for everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to seeking help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Nisio<0xC5><0x82>owski is critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Leksycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every one of his opinions was accepted.”
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activity is a great shadow of his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – the destroyer of the Church and Poland – has developed his media into the best yet for the life of Pope Poland,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were bruises of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Rydzyk<0xC3><0xB3>w did not accept, but he had power and for political leadership could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or to a parish in Fiji.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successor,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski explained.
“In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the Church’s actions and, in fact, their lack.
I ran a little forward in thought, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole shape of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been relatively recent.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski told reporters.
In the opinion of the former PO Polish politician, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Mass of Saints, and there were crosses all over the place.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II has done nothing about it, and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay the elephant,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski convinced.
“I hope that Pope Francis will drive J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of that kind,” he said.
HRUBIESZ<0xC3><0x93>W: Tomorrow the 590-year-old shop district

The PZPN plays for Burdy in the stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The start of the Polish Cup between Gryph Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with a small hair did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, was fired by the spectators from Wejherowo Raca by a millimeter.
After this incident, the game was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future matches.
The club will not be able to start at the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, bats will not be allowed in the next match for their own stadium.
They will also not be able to leave groups for league matches until 31 December.
Burds at the stadium Vidzewa <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> were also caused by <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>ska Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
However, the PZPN judgment was milder here, because Silesia predicted that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed to throw the <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> kibic<0xC3><0xB3>n sector into cracks, to set fire to chairs and to fortify the host sector.
The match was suspended for eight minutes, and the interventionist police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The travel ban also included league matches Ekstraklasa, however it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the marking on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Subcarpathia began the implementation of the modernization of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lw<0xC3><0xB3>w" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, easier to read and easier to read.
The new guidelines are based on an update of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on the detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road traffic safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the towns in the neighboring countries often also have Polish sounds.
Thanks to the changes we have made to the law, they will finally appear on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the A4 motorway section in Podkarpackie”, said the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Subcarpathia, changes will be made to 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200 thousand z<0xC5><0x82>.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
What does the realization of the idea look like?
It will run without changing tables, basically stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the new towns, written in Polish on the already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one verse – first in Polish, and then in the original, in the appendix.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill.
In the pond in Zamecze in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed the swan having problems with its wings.
After a hunt and a visit to the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set himself a target from the animal – in his body was found a syringe from the windmill.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Soli.
From the report, it turned out that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to do him any harm and not to risk additional stress.
The lavender was caught and hung up by a veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone had made a bullet shield from it.
There were fragments of sputum in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages, among other things, the rehabilitation center.
Winter in the resort
"The wounds were cleared, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He is currently unable to fly.
Letting him go now would be related to the fact that he probably wouldn’t survive the winter,” added Walasek.
The staff after undergoing the scapula of rehabilitation intends to release it in the spring to the same state.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the poor state of animal health, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the matter.

Gowin: “We must encourage Polish, small-scale trade”
“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, you will need to think about whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin, the leader of the Agreement.
During a talk in "Signs of the Day" on the radio Yedynce stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Given that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to address it at the beginning of the term, but received “countermeasures from the EC”.
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Justice wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that “the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade”.
“On top of that, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in accepting that the Polish retail tax is an unlicensed public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act included the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 per cent of the income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent of the income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax has been in effect since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller stores, which could be seen as public aid.
She then stated that the dam had been put into operation in a way that was unlawful.
It also issued an order to suspend the use of the tax until the end of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way to reintroducing the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an action before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press services of the TSUE reported to the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure will start, i.e. hearing the parties and possible hearings.
It takes a good few to a few months from the date of the appeal to announce the judgment.
“Such a procedure takes an average of a year,” a PAP source told the Court in Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We suggest a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first occasion where the whole family is focused around the child, celebrating together his or her appearance in the world.
So it’s no wonder that a freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best they can on that day.
However, before you make the final decision as to the child’s outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops you can find many machine sets that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, a few weeks of babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same pots or large potholes.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months, yearly, and even larger.
It is not difficult to imagine that such a great consolation needs already a little different clothing for baptism .
If, therefore, your child will be 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, the celebration will probably be spent in the carriage or in the hands of parents or christenings.
The best way to do this will be to equip it with comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered to be a daily outfit, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example with a skirt or crown.
For the boy, the ideal will be the points with the impression of a muzzle and a helmet.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have a bigger fantasy in the outfit.
The girl will look lovely in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls with a craving look towards richly decorated, flaky dresses for baptism in a set of coats, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-toxic materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable for their product.
In search of the right outfit, it is better to take a look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton skirts.

Voting on the break in the hearings during the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party's annual program conference, which the government has turned to.
There were 289 MPs against 306.
Usually, the House of Commons does not hold a party conference, so that Members do not have to resign from either their participation or from the sittings of Parliament.
However, the opposition parties considered that in the crucial time that has been the last weeks before Britain's planned departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the government, 289 members spoke for a break, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the convention.
No consent to the break can be received as a political revenge of opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was deemed by the Supreme Court to be unlawful and unconstitutional) and for failing to appeal.
After this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s appearance and the ensuing tumultuous debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time for Brexit.
It needs to be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit needs to be implemented so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is set to begin in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2nd.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media wrote.
The president’s spokesman strongly denied these reports.
“That’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing the Jewish Insider, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, said that Israel was to blame for the latest anti-Semitic attacks.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, who said in February that “the Poles expelled anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Poland, Poland.”
“Citation is not just inaccurate.
It’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented this".
According to the “JI” interlocutors during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that Jews from Israel “like Israel Kac” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources on the Botech portal, Mosberg's speech was to be interrupted.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he blame?
Rented by the suitors, the quarry led the journalist to discover the omissions in Mariana Banasia’s property statements.
We're going to summarise another affair that shocked the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists have revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not made a statement in recent years about the 400-meter-long estate located on Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w’s Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rz.
What’s more, his landlord was supposed to run in the aforementioned sex business quarry (and so rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been said to be a guarantee of repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel, in the program "Supervisor", drew attention to the irregularities.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the quarry was rented by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic encounters”.
Clients were supposed to be men who used the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> replied to the charges in a vague and murky manner.
Interestingly, the stonework rented by the suitors led the journalist to discover the omissions in the property statements of Banasia.
The stone itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be reduced.
“Mariana Banasia and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...],” writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the stone of Banasia itself was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently overseeing Mariana Banasia’s property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until its completion. "I will give you a free holiday march," he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Mariana Banasia’s property claims.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the authorities of the state and to make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]”, – said MP PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole so decisively underestimated the rent of his properties, he would already have 10 controls, the tax dimension and the criminal-tax procedure,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005, he worked at this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first PiS governments (2005–2008) Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served as President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has once again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served for three months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.

"Rzeczpospolita": ignoring the policeman's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a police officer’s specific order of conduct is supposed to be a new type of offense, threatened by fines, arrests or restrictions on freedom.
Such a change is being made by the police.
The idea came to the notice of the Committee on Petitions.
“The matter is serious, because now every year more than half a million cases of abuse are brought to Polish courts,” we read.
The “Republic” has determined that the petition that the Independent Union of Professional Police Officers is writing to the Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: “Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be subject to a penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
"Paragraph 3 of this regulation speaks of an identical punishment for those who, failing to carry out orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a service activity," the daily reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told the “Republic” that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political manifestations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unhelpful and instead of mitigating the situation, even if it was sharpened,” he added.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month, the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
J<0xC3><0xA1>chy Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important Czech post-war playwrights, today exchanged in a row with V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
So from the beginning there was a curse of talent hanging over J<0xC3><0xA1>chym, which he tried to use.
After eight years, he returned with the "Sensitive Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sona, along with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are traveling actors, traveling through Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a single translator who does not break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the second time stopped in infancy.
But it’s not the heroes that are the most important in this story.
They are all just the background to observe a world in which there is no more room for artistic nomads.
It’s a world of a bustling province, a society of old, suspicious people, and a solution to youth.
The "sensitive man" places turn into an absurd theatricality.
The narrative follows the didacles, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines Cancels 105 Flights Due to Bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but at the same time they will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandalf court also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
At present, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were scheduled to leave the office by the end of the year.
Even on Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company's mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought the tours in it will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest and one of the world’s largest travel agencies, has announced a fall overnight from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of talks of the last chance with creditors and potential investors.
In addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900m bailout already agreed in August, the firm received an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies typically have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have increased over the years, resulting in a debt of <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia has played fantastically.

G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for review
Free accommodation in exchange for a review – such an unusual offer was prepared for the future German G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz.
The actions are meant to help in the fight against the ongoing decline in the population of the city.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
A beautiful pastel old woman attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian says, the city is struggling with significant problems.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz has the lowest salaries in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left to the west of the country, which translates into a 25% decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, there were 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been affected by the programme.
Two-thirds of them were residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
“When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz,” one of the project participants said.
“We now feel that it doesn’t matter if we stay here for four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
While the city authorities are hopeful that some will move on to a permanent, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the participants of the program.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help in the revival of smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, who was in charge of the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of these was Detroit, which introduced a payment program promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
