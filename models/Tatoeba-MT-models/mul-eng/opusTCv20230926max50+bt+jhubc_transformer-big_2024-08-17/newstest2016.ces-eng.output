In an emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and was required to come home to them.
Lamb imagined that his "sweet dog" was at home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," Lamb wrote in a letter.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would walk 300 miles on a school campus where police believe he shot a favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
In the end, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
One day after the school shooting, students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, with the authorities still trying to figure out what Lamb’s motivation was.
The details published by state-run investigators and students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented, but probably a problem-solving teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in gratitude to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
The two studied at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with another 17 faculty members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there was a tilt when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to release him for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become a professor's assistant.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb must have suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, the police captured his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a gun in a courthouse about a mile from his parents in Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went into this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring, he earned a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s long-time friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her how to play guitar for several years.
It was quite a heart attack back then.
“The heart of all the girls was discovered as soon as it appeared,” says Hairston, now 40, who lives in Jackson suburbs.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former Prentiss husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O’Steen said he didn’t meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail went to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O’Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sparsely lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a pot that Lamb played on guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We joked and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students, and community members, attended candlelight commemorative events.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually dating.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won’t take as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the manufacturer of children’s toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees at stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be for a part-time job.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and employees will pick up during October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees for help in stores and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox joked about his ‘rand’ with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in a trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in Time."
The movie begins and I find myself in the middle of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s really the best travel document ever filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons only worsens the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN chief urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at a Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching the Iran nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Figures That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others above the mage's hand as above the unspoken joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whether or not some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they don’t succeed (for now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for the nomination chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this period of 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership made the way for Herman Cain’s rise, not one of them eventually won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in the general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are beginning to put their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real magnet is not just a transitional phase:
Trump’s rating of favorability turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a vote by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this reality magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After a vote by Quinnipiac University last week, it turned out that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "burned" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “excited” to 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "excited" if Jeb Bush's favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his aggravation and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that the realist has the right temperament for the post of president, according to a Monday vote by ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is being held at the Iowa State Senatorial Club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When he puts on his student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s the change from late July, when four out of 10 people put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
That time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against Mitt Romney’s 28 percent.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump will still defeat almost everyone.
Some students emphasize that the split field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct conflict between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one game.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT Tuesday poll shows that just over half of Trump-supported voters say they will no longer change their minds.
It is clear that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they keep their back doors open for change among the candidates.
Yet Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration continues to be the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s abjectness is pulling key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and trying to rebrand the damage.
But according to a new ABC/Post public opinion poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of the outsider.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post poll on Monday said they wanted a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
There is also a lot of anger in Washington.
A vote by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hellfully angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state’s carbon taxes.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In its first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government’s draft of the Upper Law, which regulates the amount of the levy on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that this will help them get more money from both the state treasury and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by the members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House of Representatives supported the government's novel of the upper estate, which would have a cost from the bill, which
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the negroes that companies will make.
The change in fees for the mining of negroes is expected to bring in the state treasury by CZK 427 million more than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and a state budget of 150 million crowns.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about 200 million kroner and the state 66 million kroner.
The novel also counts on an increase in the remuneration from the catchment area with a permit to mine to 1000 crowns per one hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be in full proportion to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year instead of this.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
Reimbursement is recalculated as a component of the amount of recovered necrosis and rates for individual types of necrosis.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned against the fact that the imposition of the government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dka, however, in this case it is not a tax, because the state pays for the non-growth, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state's money will be obtained.
The ratio will be the same even in the case of extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state will choose from the mining fees will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm the mining communities and the regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just because Mr. Minister of Finance is improving his budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner (<0xC3><0x9A>svit) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck region.
Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1>, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned against the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not pass to coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
“But on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in wages by an effort to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees from the point of view of employment is negligible.
According to the rapporteur on the novel by Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining even before the passing of the law.
If coal is used even beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should break down already for social, economic reasons and for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India on the table and this time each of them will most likely hit the game as well.
Captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til is planning to deploy the load to the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why it is expected to be challenging matches that can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take it in the pot.
I'd like to expand it according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, said Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til during today's Czech selection exercise in the center of Radje Kum<0xC3><0xA1>r Khanna.
With one team and the world’s forty, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts to Friday and Sunday two hours.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek are likely to flow into the position of the pair.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
I've got a little bit of it in my head, but I won't say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech squad should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka’s participation in Saturday’s four-game game.
It’s just a question of who will stand next to the experienced fat lady who has a balance of 18:4 in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be a happy one.
There are still options with Rosol, or Adam Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek.
"I really don't know who and what it's going to look like," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two.
The variant may be Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek, with Vesel<0xC3><0xAD> surprised in the 1st round by a win in a bout over Australana.
"He's right in his mouth," he said.
I have been successful against Australia, and if I play, I would like to show the same performance that I have shown there since the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek said.
The home team is tied with Yuki Bhambri (125th in ATP standings) who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, defeating players on the third and fourth centuries of the ladder.
The second will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both challengers and we have experience from the ATP Tour, but we’ve been convinced many times that the ladders in the Davis Cup don’t decide.
"Deciding the current form, weather," he said.
The Friday opening hours start at 6:30 SEL<0xC4><0x8C> and can be charged due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it's raining and the yard isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting.
They've already burned it, and it's got about two thousand luxuries, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut in PMQ is very eagerly awaited
Jeremy Corbyn’s new chief executive will make his Prime Minister’s Questions debut later, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In the weekly statement, he asked for "less theater and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby’s leadership, coming after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday address to the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand in silence during the national anthem singing service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle for Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in reverent silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless of” his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences in the work are also "arranged" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's duty limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers’ Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow labor and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" pushed back on government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from the crowd” to questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says the PMQ is too confrontational and will refrain from both "ready-made answers" and "toothed trade," and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea that he would let other colleagues come after him from time to time, because he had heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with Speaker of the House John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders’ judgment, their leadership of the House, and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become caricatures and are in need of far-reaching reforms.
"Foceni v Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Libra is on the rise as wage growth in the UK accelerates
Libra jumped on the following dates and showed a recovery of British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher with the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed like estimates were approaching when the rates were going up.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at $1,5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped by 20% after getting closer to the offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer together.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from a rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest decline in the index and fell by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in half-year earnings before tax of <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The CEO of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could affect JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment marsmelon are cheering.
Controversial construction has gained a foothold.
The investor of Prague Progetti e Investimenti considers the cancellation of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people were protesting against the building, which was to be built in the immediate vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>ské convent in the center of Prague, and petitions were also raised in front of the Prague office.
The magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a violation of the construction law, as not all the merits of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not include, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensible shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the building's influence," the decision reads.
He also considers that some of the documents for the decision have been issued for the documentation originally discussed, which has, however, changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the written material that, however, the owner of the land has only consented to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the placement of the building on its land, writes the committee of the building order.
According to Francesca August Razett, an investment firm’s construction policy committee did not take note of the decision of the superior authority – the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous move.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all relevant authorities and institutions," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people are nicknamed Marshmallow because of the supposedly designed fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, evokes a strong emotion in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the center of the city in the past to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued for a house many years ago, which should have looked different.
They also criticise the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>ské convent.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fr<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the project has changed several times.
The original version of the 2008 project, which included a glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Institute of Monuments (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and revoked the permission of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the form of faces was approved by the NP<0xC3><0x9A> as well as the magisterial monuments and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the statements of the opponents, he said never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after the pink-white confectionery.
The Czech politicians brought in migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in the base.
Berg went to Hungary in order to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who were said to be about half a kilometer away.
It was not a crime in Hungary at the time, he told the People's newspaper.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not engage in such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the investigative prison in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours.
The police said they were doing the right thing, but they were communicating because they didn't speak English very well.
However, according to him, the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters in size, 15 refugees from Syria were squeezed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were there the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What's not to have fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday, September 18th, from 9:30 a.m., the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, will answer the questions of the readers.
You can ask her about changes to the Executions Act effective September 1, 2015 and other things related to the Executions or Executors.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and soy sauces.
IGA merchants and suppliers are adding brands such as the Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering flavors in IGA stores and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot to bet on as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s trading moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will account for 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over the market from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retail could lose 360 million dollars in annual sales and Metcash 250 million dollars at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a fixed Metcash price base could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s food trade revenue, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retail stores, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesalers have gone into counter-attack and are investing more than $150 million a year to match the desk prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip the stores by adding fast-growing salt and salt to their products.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, says that price-equilibrium and trade supply programs are catching up and hopes that wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a sideline loss in a recent lawsuit around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, said Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by referees, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one to draw Kyrgios and I had to draw him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after the crash thwarted Richard Gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakise relentlessly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes against Sam Groth for a second-place finish behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely that in my opinion Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost to the US, but he's not the first player to get angry at his rocket because of his frustration. I know Thanasi quite well and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really managed very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated pretty hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and falls into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is very stable and I am a mature young boy, I feel bad
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgios for an important match that begins on Friday, stating that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a native from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stalemate.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him," Healy said.
And I think that Nick got up very quickly, as Federer, Murray, and other people show, he's growing so fast in the eyes of the public, he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to push him, or we're trying to help him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally so as to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted violently.
Those who have been trapped for an unknown time on the belts of the land between the two states stand those who flee from violence in their native countries, build up their tents and settle down.
But there is a feeling of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call out "Open the borders!" and offer the regular units of the Hungarian police.
Some people refuse to give up food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for the refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would be accepted by EU nations by more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not impose its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s threat situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up court cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a fence from a narrow wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the sharp wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are living a better life and not war refugees who are seeking protection, which is a view that is clearly different from other EU countries including Germany.
The new legislation, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalises the violation of a 4 metre fence that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
“Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of threat,” Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman in the southern city of Szeged, told reporters.
In this we are quite clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n's home defense adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people who had tried to cross the border and had already arrested 15 people on the state's territory.
They broke through with damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly allowed the fence to be repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered by a tow wire.
At the main border crossing near Roszka, chaos ensued as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and pressure was exerted on the people.
About 20 of them went inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's jump ahead of Bernie Sanders has dropped by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit jump in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching her jump.
Clinton is now backing 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is getting support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that there are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a big leap between women and is mitigating, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men declined significantly, and Sanders lost only 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated and now they are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit jump ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would be excited to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain conditions, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are mixed between those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would be enthusiastic about her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it’s time to be president of a woman (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great possibility of choice and agreement on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to face it - a third thinks he should not run.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton’s supporters, more than half cited Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far the second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the issue of greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of election.
Just like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some of the key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of the three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, that is, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have that opinion.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
With regard to all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as a state secret continue, the majority of primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it was their overall view of the issue.
But between the American public, it's a totally different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were shared as early as March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while at 36 percent their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It’s mostly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among voters of her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from last month’s poll.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as being honest than being dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't have an opinion on him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson to run for Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are left to seek support.
Voters from a number of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump by the overwhelming majority, stemming from 23% of the support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well-versed in demographic groups, and singled out Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, has fallen to the current 2% in the back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker at a 10% support margin.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the most recent survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed that Carson has improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey from the ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s trend grew, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon in the service blindly, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during a brazen fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, charges of murder were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the start of the ceremony in September 2013 and the delayed ones took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police say he had his eyes tied, had a backpack full of sand weighing a total of <0xC2><0xA3>30, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found it time to change Dengo's dress, take a look at his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's president-elect, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, members began to hide the equipment and essentially gave preference to the well-being of the fraternity over the life of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the drinking report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternities being overreacted and at least one student has been dying every year from overreacted since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, wrote in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must take responsibility and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assaulting exaggeration and criminal association.
"We want to hold not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity abolished its relationship with the local branch offices.
This Is What Happens When the Fed Raises Interest Rates
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will collapse, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We all know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
In particular, the history of the economy offers a small guide to timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when interest rates will start to rise, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that any habit due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, the global leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to be more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past cca month, the expected rise in rates can make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for the resumption of stocks after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s increase.
More precisely, the market for the last about 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - aimed at increasing the rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal condition after the expiration of 500 days, with an increase in average of 14 per cent, with an increase of 2,6 per cent.
Deutsche said the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help it.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product nears its lowest point in history when raising Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was just under 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, it is hardly expected to be maintained, while in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed reports.
Increasing rates in this complex economic context could be risky and a question could arise, "Since this time it is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for Fed growth throughout the year and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all of the increase cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of increasing the leverage effect with HDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and we are still continuing.
The fixed yield was also volatile because the market expects interest rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more visible in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the direction of policy.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
The strategist Charles Schwaba believes that the increase in interest rates will lead to an approximation of the returns between long- and short-dated bonds, which equals the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although “we’re still careful about tightening the yield,” said Kathy Jones, a firm analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to the Fed's policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policies,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is wider, the credit range has widened and volatility has increased – all the characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after the interest rate rises and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be able to do worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to exceed within three months of the initial rate increase," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance-sheet companies in every increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-yield companies, as well as low-volatility stocks, also outperformed their counterparties by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also profit thanks to the growing dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "stunning"
There is an opinion that it is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
MP Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not even the original idea
BBC Radio 3 “changes” into Classic FM, claims the frontman, and gathers fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove they’re doing something commercial broadcasts don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be "stupid" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "foolish" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that attack me when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and making music is actually at the top level.
“I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the public than before, as the British are less educated when it comes to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production that got under fire for slapping on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – in which the September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges – was made “in a way typical of the BBC.”
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it launches a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending the money of license fee payers on other formats of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be the culprit
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the year 2000 when the records themselves began.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for the suspension of spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise and thanks to it has become a ghost town from many of the UK’s main streets.
However, experts say there are signs of stalling online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase since the beginning of the measurement in 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of stalling online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth over the past few years and go back to 2000, that situation has always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s market index editor, told The Guardian.
It explains that internet sales were boosted three years ago, when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be stagnant.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was transmitted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, more than five times the average of shoppers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and agree on several of the sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers contract again, can keep customers from further purchases.
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was lost online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, rather than shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of the fall of a crane in Mecca, and Bin Laden's family was sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were transported through Muslim streets during the first funeral in Mexico.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
According to the Ministry of Health, a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of a crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, where the bodies of the victims were carried across the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose the path and paid tribute to the victim when the first of the fallen got on their last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the building crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the believer.
The body was released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of a crane in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were taken to the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first voyage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj will be held in Mecca and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman today stated that Binadin Group should not leave the crane's shoulder up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the statement, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the record agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company's bosses were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane in the Great Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are co-ordinating before the Hajj march later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The Royal Declarations also blamed the group for not using the latest security measures, and the lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and run large construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a man who was abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The accident took place in the middle of a strong wind and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a journey that every eligible Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be dedicated to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European traders working for cheap are already doing the trend
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix shops focused on retailers
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Developed by Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British say they lay off hammers and brushes and hand them over to trained East European artisans to work at their home.
If you're dealing with a hammer or a paint brush, it seems like you're in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing artisans to carry out kutil work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for home needs, says that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more business-focused Screwfix stores, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
At present, the majority of workers are male.
She said there is a need to address rising demographic trends that show more women’s households performing more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says: "Most of the men still work in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the purchase decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between the directors of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in the fact that it has half the representation of women among its employees, including its executive and financial director.
Ms. Laury says: “It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both earnings in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the stores.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 kroner to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It's justice for equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, Chairman of the ODS Members, noted that while the one-time contribution sounds good, it would be better in the long run to be in standard valorisation, as it would be projected into the next years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to fix this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksov<0xC3><0xA1> (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which the next year was to be valued above the law.
Marx defended the grant by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not pink.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion kroner and ministers are debating every stamilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Op<0xC3><0xA1>lka (CSM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right to pay in December will significantly complicate and perhaps even impossibility, he said.
The president of the Czech SSR MPs Roman Sklen<0xC3><0xA1>k therefore proposed a shortening of the deadline for the discussion of the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, even blocking the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion kroner.
The money should come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the coming year, pensions should increase on average by about a stokorum.
The contribution should be received according to the pension novels by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
Those who lost their right to a pension in December could also receive it before it was paid.
However, they would have to ask for a supplement in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly until January, which is about the increase in prices and a third of the increase in real wages.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
According to the state final account, the state invested CZK 314.7 billion in old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more annually.
The expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 per cent of all budget expenditures and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension last year grew by 104 to 10,714 kroner, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration has secured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certainly a billionaire.
In the Council of the Federation he was to represent the West Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the government party of the United Russia, defended his post in Sunday elections with an overview.
Under Russian law, the senators do not elect citizens, but elect them as governor of three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor's election.
After the election, the senator of the three candidates will choose himself.
The complication for Jakunin was the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin in that he is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, to which the legal requirement of long-term stay does not apply.
Finished filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of Tiger.
The last drop in the lead role of the main character is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who was overcome with strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urov<0xC3><0xA1> decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
Janov<0xC3><0xA1> is clear that he and his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1> are on a similar path.
He will remember that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live honestly and freely again.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the one he has already chosen, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k told the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedic form, in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be Barto<0xC5><0xA1>k, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We've been dating for three years.
I let him read the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And I'm surprised he's apparently a spoiled sportsman.
In the past, he had always wondered where he was going to sit before filming.
This time he rode a bike, climbed the stairs and even walked up the hill.
And all this in record tropical winds, the director said.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of it over time.
They'll feed him a little bit, but they'll close the door right away, so he doesn't accidentally think he's playing outside the rabbit hole for the tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the audience, created Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks it well.
But at the same time, she is a rapist and wants to cheer her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - T<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmov<0xC3><0xA1> and Pavel Beretov<0xC3><0xA1> - and the descendants of Erika and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k - Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelka and Jakub Koh<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Rozhlas a telev<0xC3><0xAD>zia Slovensko.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The U.S. Internet company Google has promised to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charity of this internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled part of Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka has postponed the upcoming Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have today cancelled the official part of the visit.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Baku justifies this by a resolution from last week that criticizes the human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka co-authored.
The decision of the Azerbaijani party Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka came about the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, explained in a press release of his Brussels office.
Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use the path, which had been planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as representatives of democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the <0xC4><0x8C>TK clarified.
The EP resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in the political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent verdict on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadijah Ismail, who pledged to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
Nothing is ruled out, he said.
Russia already has an airborne naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which has been used as a service and logistics center to date.
According to reports of the Russian press, however, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria has risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to set up an air base near the city of Latakh, which for now remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, according to U.S. commentators.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, their third phone call in the past ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to go to Moscow next week to explain concerns about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called on Moscow’s support for Assad for a lost bet.
Russia’s policy goals in Syria are rather unclear, he said.
According to him, Moscow has made its own satellite from Syria.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, this is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to speculation from the Russian press today.
The situation in Ukraine’s Donbas, on the contrary, says the Russian leader is not willing to speak at all.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
However, the views of the White House advisers are said to be different.
TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Apply sesame oil on a bile diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressing from the seeds behind the cold, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, for example, gastric.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of Czech deaths for several years.
Inflammation of the gallbladder mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are among the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the spice sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gastric diet.
The essential fatty acids that it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the causes of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder concern especially people with overweight who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should pay attention to goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use overripe seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But oil will lose all the active substances, said Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of Bohemian Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces organic virgin oil pressed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unspoiled seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox will be able to wipe out 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oil is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerské, who led the research at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not actually suitable for frying, already at 180 <0xC2><0xB0>C it begins to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and is especially suitable in a diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol levels.
For heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of fat and calories taken in overall.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially-managed products.
Therefore, it is advisable to apply extra virgin oils.
This sunflower will last as well as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
By storing in the refrigerator, the shelf life will be extended even further.
Old oil people know, especially according to the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no downside to confusion.
It is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds are classified as so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
For this label, it is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself, and a person must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, whereas Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and in healing wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling.
It is sold 500 liters per year.
People often use one spoonful of lavender in the morning.
Hemp oil is not tastefully distinctive, but it greatly strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Krasli company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, Americans are the most demanding nation of barbecuers.
There are 1.4 grills in one house.
All over the world, there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not smoke.
Most of them even grill a few times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time, when grilling, will leave the health of the beneficial substance?
In general, during the grilling process itself, it should be saved by fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oil then also comes about the body of a beneficial substance, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from foods adjusted at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately equip themselves with vegetable oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique characteristic of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion up to 216 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
So, even at such a high temperature, one of the few oils that preserves the health of a beneficial substance, describes the benefits of Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek grape oil from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the vine of wine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Furthermore, it contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consuming grape oil also helps to increase our outer beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and cracked hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold meals, for example when tasting salads, but also for the heat treatment of meals.
Thus, when grilling, you can use two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juicyness.
In the preparation of marinade must be present three components: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, add the acidity to the apple cider vinegar and thus achieve the softening of the meat.
The spice again adds a lot of flavor and oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare food.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil, thus preventing the food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
For grilled meat and fish, almost anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil, for example, recommend salad Hot summer.
To it you need: <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 piece of broccoli <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 bundle of handcuffs <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of chopped cucumber <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of a mixture of lettuce leaves <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a mixture of chopped handfuls of lettuce leaves, chopped cucumbers and chopped peaches on large cubes.
Depending on the taste of the salt and pepper, you can also taste the ground chilli and soy sauce.
In the end, cover with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Disturbed sclerosis: it depends not only on the medications, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Distracted sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation, if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, recommendations on the adjustment of housing, etc. are included in the care of these patients.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he actively struggles with the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passiveness of the sick frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement takes a considerable distance from the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example that the disease automatically leads them to end up on the trolley.
That’s why the Give You a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give You a Chance.
The most important person in the care of the sick with sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of ruptured sclerosis, it is worth twice as much to say that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for ruptured sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we hit, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and distance the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic at the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with severe sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often resolves the weakening of the lower limbs or imbalances.
He works with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
“It’s really individual, it depends on the patient’s specific problems,” says MUDr. Martina K<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC3><0xA1>ri, primary care of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in everyone in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation may not stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of ruptured sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is the fact that the patients check what they can do, and it strengthens their self-confidence.
"In exercise, endorphins also float and people feel good about it," says Dr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic at the Royal Vinohrady Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we are acting on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Directly, we intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were saved, today we know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, an advantage of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physiotherapy is that one can remain as self-sufficient as possible, including work placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to ensure that each person receives a compensatory aid tailored to his or her needs.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sick soul, we have to go after someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally conclude that even with a disability, you can live a full life and that severe sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinov<0xC3><0xA1> - Schubertov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty of Medicine.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the buses would not fly.
Aviation production is a synonym for precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which no one can produce and process immediately.
However, in addition to super precise, computer-controlled machining machines, in addition to autoclaves for forming composites, it is possible to come across something as ordinary as smelting furnaces.
In the drum, which resembles a pot on a sugar vat, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are washed in the pile of sawdust.
"So far, no one has come for anything better," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, general manager of the aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>anés, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also composite doors for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Perhaps the instant key allows the company to arrange twice a year.
If there is a lack of control on the yellow sticker, they should explain in the Prague race to the Airbus or Boeing auditors who are driving regularly to see if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
They have to be handcuffed by the rodents.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the impact hammer, they will know if the thread is already properly cracked.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nose can extend from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the plane's surface.
That's about double the thickness of human hair.
During the check comes a number of trained items.
When the controller passes the finger through a series of grooves, it will find out if there is any outside tolerance.
Only then will he take into his hand the exact deviation.
The aircraft fed before 1989 the program of the training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, not one was produced.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
At the time, it was merged with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection procedure for the emergency door supplier for the A321.
The deal with Boeing wasn't that happy.
“We were a small company for them at the time that didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee long-term stable deliveries to Boeing,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain locked if Letov did not rely on the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry in 1999.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus there.
The next day, the negotiations with the French broke out, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new contracts.
As early as 2000, parts of the door for the A320 were dismantled.
Three years later, the doors of the upper deck for the A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for composite processing due to deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big contracts on our own.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
Partners want a guarantee of supply for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of more than 2.9 billion and profit after taxing 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and proof of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not be able to produce any doors into airplanes.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of the customers, and maintaining them in repeated checks is worth, according to the Dubai Million Crown.
The production process changes every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> supplies.
Now the company completes the preparation process for zinc and nickel recovery, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they received tasks from the manufacturer, they then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come in, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're also checking our lab.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared with ours, approaching the way in which the customers control them.
The rewards are long-term exclusive contracts for Prague companies.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean he can say anything at any price.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It indicates how many one door will stand after ten, fifty, stitches made of pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price pattern.
If we don't, we'll do it, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are completed, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain is a new semi-robotic line for demolition and installation of doors for the innovative A320 Neo model.
It will speed up and sharpen.
"This is the trend that aviation assembly is taking," adds Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The future line is secure.
Airbus reports that the airlines have ordered 3,278 pieces of the new A320.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, before that, the company has to pass the qualifying tests necessary for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
“It’s a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials,” says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly.
Latecoere, however, is on the verge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the area of Letov, where he resides, there is no other place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and in three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing anticipate how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered by airlines each year, they don’t have to worry about work.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the Prague-based parent company Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to pay off the loans in September.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loans were exchanged for shares.
Creditors gained a 37.4 percent stake in the company by raising capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company listed new shares among the existing shareholders for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it raised the base capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which make up 85 percent of the market.
The average increase in contracts is expected to be four per cent per annum by 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four-year production.
French media says Latecoere can finally breathe in again after years on the drops.
The Czech race in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>anés is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state's carbon tax.
The change in fees for the mining of negroes is expected to bring in the state treasury by CZK 427 million more than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and a state budget of 150 million crowns.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about 200 million kroner and the state 66 million kroner.
The novel also counts on an increase in the remuneration from the catchment area with a permit to mine to one thousand crowns per one hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be in full proportion to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year instead of this.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
Reimbursement is recalculated as a component of the amount of recovered necrosis and rates for individual types of necrosis.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned against the fact that the imposition of the government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dka, however, in this case it is not a tax, because the state pays for the non-growth, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state's money will be obtained.
The ratio will be the same even in the case of extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state will choose from the mining fees will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition MPs, who in particular claimed that it would harm the mining communities and the regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just because Mr. Minister of Finance is improving his budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner (<0xC3><0x9A>svit) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck region.
Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1>, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned against the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not pass to coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
“But on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in wages by an effort to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees from the point of view of employment is negligible.
According to the rapporteur on the novel by Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining even before the passing of the law.
If coal is used even beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should break down already for social, economic reasons and for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been sitting for years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy was doing fairly well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and later on the same day as his colleague — wrote a message claiming that he was “saddened” by his first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government authorities.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the cops to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “stupid dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone” but is upset.
Police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why he shot himself in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss found a handwritten message from Lamb that read, “I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile long journey to Delta University, where he killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O’Steen and Prentiss was “shocked” by the incident.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss' close friend, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss was working from home over the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
Police said on Monday that Lamb had spoken to his relatives and said he "wouldn't go to jail."
When police reached him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he was shot.
According to his CV, which he published on the school’s website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was detained for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are definitely picking up their tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for a couple of months due to a double-dealer.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-handed defender left this injury in his tears and kicked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by the reckless action of Héctor Moren in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw penetrated the PSV.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - the guy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old it's very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in his closet, he also had an oxygen mask.
Plate.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I’m sure he’ll be playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish Mexicans.
Van Gall pointed out that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to everyone for their messages, words can't express how I'm destroyed, my journey to recovery begins now and I'll be back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach of PSV, said, "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the players.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a 2014 World Cup match against Van Gaal in Mexico.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the players, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] was touching him, but I didn’t see a move on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's procedure.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
This is something every parent knows: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn to remember it.
You can't be David Cameron.
At the request of the provider of children's schemas to name a favorite children's book, he chose the president of the government of Lorax, a fairy tale from Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “Funny, impressive, creative and with strong content, I loved reading it to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before.”
Well, until after that in the next paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book according to the 2012 film elevator, which added additional characters and details to fill in the short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by a wall where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree, the worm, the worm, the worm's eye, the worm's eye.
As it was not suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron reads like a summary excerpt of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville a wall, where all nature ceases to exist, and even with the winds of hell
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have become acquainted with the events of the book, where the unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastating the gravelly, tree-climbing industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests, will be a figure of the titular Loxe.
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR task was given to an assistant who never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a piece.
Downing Street spokesman said the text probably came from the office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of abandoning England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England have chosen for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in the Test series will be very unlikely.
I wouldn't rule out a guest's win either.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this racket and also collective thinking is strong; they do not carry the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the trial level, represents an attacking option.
Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the series experience and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to abandon Adam Lytha is a hard nut for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshir.
His seven tests stood up against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that they are cricketers judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root there were no questioners, which led to the announcement, because — and this I mentioned earlier — players are their best picks.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let’s hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performances were not 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the bat gets to prove itself is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and abroad.
The only thing you can remcat for is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this wasted opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a batsman, and I appreciate it very well.
He's an x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won 236 against us on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors had, but all of this will, of course, depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was put forward and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't fire, and this lefty man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 Tests before making his appearance in 2001.
He was successful for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he fascinated me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a springboard, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decided for the youth.
There is a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems that England has made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relieve and refresh the atmosphere.
Col. Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
Unthinking David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets into further trouble with every passing day and without the choice of genius Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Workers’ Party, or the TUC will take place in the European Parliament on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most of them did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so even if they were in favour of social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an uncounted Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some of the capitals have reached the point where they are not allowed to leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes too bad for her, as was the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Frenchman Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power will also fall.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to see how they break their legs with the help of the British Selfie, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – which is something they don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiation."
Europeans know how expensive Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU are of the oligarch barons because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vividly remember the name of Boris Johnson, a frantic Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based EU straight bananas reporter in the early 1990s.
Despite his greed, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax evaders, foreigners hacking phones, and the pseudo non-sea departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with an angry gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so you don't have dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was overthrown by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a ballot.
The press never forgave him either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who made me cry in Westminster on Monday with his friends on my back - I told him I should not waste any more time - seems to be in danger of re-accepting the strategy of the Murdoch boycott Neil Kinnock, which was also a mistake.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin’s official position on Europe is evolving, I will say welcome.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's fierce tendency and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly approach it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment as an abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father was fighting on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not, according to everything, what McDonnell said, nor did JC say to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, it touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of daily television transmission, and especially in the faith, a mixture of paranoia and betrayal, which are the media's
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as obvious, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic escalation of membership in the EU – in line with their Bennite-dominated economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogma.
Just as with his outburst on Nato – Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of it all for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – because of Britain’s concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Britain's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of something called the British Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Review of Electronic Published Agency Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a “table” report last month and described it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, an editorial in the professional journal Lancet attacked the "extremely chatty base" on which the agency PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect that PHE’s claims, which sound “currently the best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people called upon to prepare a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved BAT’s public health mandate in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but did not deliver the funding he allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the papers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at the PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report appears in this group "explicitly admits," lacking "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes would act as a pathway to smoking for children or non-smokers,” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking and smoking-related diseases cost the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion per year.
A clear emphasis on the current evidence – that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give a right hand" to hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs, which will likely only be watched by a handful of people, in difficult broadcasting times versus its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as the BBC4.
After general manager Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is entering and broadcasting programs that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House Communications Commission as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation of programs that others don’t produce or provide should be reduced at least.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as broad a support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would send him out is a ridiculous joke, and of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded non-contributoryly.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on home soil.
Honestly, the other channels would give them their right hand.
I can't understand what these public broadcasting services are like.
I don't think it would at all weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for reaching ratings "because of the ambitious people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the BBC's most popular shows is echoed by former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more ambitious public service programs "transmit to the BBC4, where it is quite often impossible to measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are going to their covert mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of non-receipt of all fees."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the licensing fee, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people who have <0xC2><0xA3>150 a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don’t watch the BBC so much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its reithav mission in the sense of "informing, educating and having fun."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production had already been classified as educational – it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio production – and should take the role of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and turn into “inform, clarify and entertain.”
On the topic of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the spindles move.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that is able to control sound waves.
Small scales change direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses act by switching cells from genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.

Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient's brain.
The moles usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would be delivered when it was placed in a liquid containing a microscopic bubble.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the cartilage by means of ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied an ultrasound to these modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubblines and transferred to the worms where the modified motor neurons were switched on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
However, Chalasani was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Ads swirling British arms trade.
Watch the video about the anti-army market from Amnesty International.
It's a deadly drone!
Footprints that break the ankle!
Trespassing shots!
And electric demarcating shoes that cause unbearable pain, but leave no footprints!
The cheerful voice and caricature of metaphor leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International because of the emphasis on the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the Centre’s defense and security facilities.

But a separate campaign is also carried out with the creation of posters on bus stops and metros, which require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling on the DLR from September 15 to 18?" read one, using the London Metro sign with the DLR lines becomes a tank image.
This year in September, a handful of arms dealers will descend on the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy, Dismaland.
The collective name Special Patrol Group has helped distribute across London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen Key, which allegedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists within the protest movement and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-trafficking posters in the subway.
The video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
Creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the gun trade ads – he saw a vacancy in the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s show them a campaign that’s trying to avoid.”
They were playing with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but “by adding a variety of colors and animations, I was aiming to attract more people.”
“They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is for the United Kingdom government to take action and ensure that it does not illegally trade with the torture equipment on our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for "on the shoulder of AT4CS RS firefighting."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from the rear of the armor inside the target."

8 Golden Rules for Life at College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an inattentive nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in bartenders and moral relativism, but until now, I have equipped myself with the strained smiles of those I’ve been training—and numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on to the tracks can range from mild to nerve-wracking to totally intimidating.
It’s tempting to bluff: telling people where you’ve come from, if you’ve taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why “you honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because people, it’s just a extract from HAHAHA, I’ll be at my house in peace.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe as well - ask and express interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't have fun with even if your lashes were in one fire and they'd be releasing fire extinguishers.
Leave room for people.
People’s rooms often change to drink receptions, movie evenings, and public places, but they are also rooms where people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts will be coming to college soon.
Your room should be a refuge, yet with a lot of rails turning into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to get drunk.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can return to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a colleague is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to chat.
When it comes to talking, talk.
One guy in my lap used to say that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you've started going to college on top of a baking mania, knocking on a foreign door and performing with a plate of baked cakes seems a little less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I've baked for you, now smile at me while I'm gone."
Offering home-cooked meals is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and maybe it will all end up making your face a pleasant surprise.
This is, of course, the point of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and butter will probably prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime of course, but is a drop of milk a steal in your tea?
Make sure to check with the owner of the milk twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even when they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who has swapped his milk for a detergent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could shut down the drums and bass a little bit because they were 3 in the night and in the morning she had a letter.
Their answer was to strengthen the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5 in the morning, she calmly let them sleep for two hours and then left her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future cat walked on the same tracks as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you'd been snooping around roommates for your future trip, sleeping together, breaking up, and having to see each other every day, and maybe also taking control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you don't have a heart - but if your sexy roommate is 100% not your future boyfriend, at least try to talk to your frailties a little bit.
In the ascending moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin border between the funny and the chic.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them - never read someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in the bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has had a rough time already during her pregnancy with today's seven-year-old Witka.
His father broke up with her and was alone in the preparation and upbringing of the offspring.
I was able to cope with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and I was looking for a positive in it.
Insecure and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly hoped within myself that we would not be alone for a long time, reminds Eva today of her first pregnancy.
Already at that time she met on the internet in the chat of an older Vashka, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Vasek Eva and V<0xC3><0xAD>tk even brought home from the maternity ward, but he didn't care too much about the role of a non-own father.
"For a while, he pulled out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in volume 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness for the second attempt.
The care of V<0xC3><0xAD>tka and the financial security of the family was managed thanks to part-time work and great help from mom and help from aunt.
In the end, the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not detract from Vaska’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tk’s second birthday, and he now understands V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ka as his father and also addresses him in this way.
Although Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, fatherhood in the 60s enjoys, according to his words, and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tka, another two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka came to them and finally a couple.
“But it affected our family in a way that was natural, maybe even because my mother never spoke much to me in a relationship,” she says with a smile.
Less space?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born with an imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disruption in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood pregnant and are especially manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn fetus, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth will usually self-regulate.
Ema and Ela were born healthy for Evin and Vaska’s happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where Va<0xC5><0xA1>kov’s niece, who managed to take over and accommodate her, also works.
Elinka was older and immediately after the transfer from JIP to the room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the twins, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting for the arrival of the children in Eve's womb did not make the joy.
"I was crazy about my husband and kids," recalls the hard moments at the six-week four-times mother's department.
She and her husband also considered signing a reversal, among other things, because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen in the end, and the doctors let Eve and the twins into the home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and childbirth broadcast <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A very large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with an electric double-plot and condensed conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we're gonna have a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive in particular the family comfort and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or opacity of the house.
For the time being, we have been sitting very well, better than we expected.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and we sometimes exceed the cuddly baby, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who is able to find a positive side in every situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s work as an illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes he goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60’s, according to his words of care for the finances of the family and children, he is physically in control of how long it will be like this?
“I realize that due to our age difference, I will one day be the one who will feed this family,” Eva admits on the level when questioning the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more interested in the possibility of owning a business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly cool for the employer.
And when it's the worst, we can swap taxis with our husband, a cute blonde joker.
Apple has a no-no effect.
They can display anything.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a stronger chassis or a touch-recognizing display, these are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s up-to-date trend was that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, the weight of which slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in weight in the disadvantage of the news was really negligible.
However, this does not apply to new iPhones.
In contrast to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, and by 20 grams for the larger model.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year’s affair with bending in Apple’s pockets greatly diminished.
The chassis is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which has also been reflected on the weight.
But it has a much greater impact on the display.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of the touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with another layer of capacitance sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones’ displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, for a larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty also thanks to the tinting crust, which has touched most of the remaining components.
In the case of a larger model, it is then the most difficult element used by the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the largest increase is visible right at the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
To the extent that the new display technology will be practical, it will only appear when used.
The first users will be able to test it as early as Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have you been a champion of breakfasts for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find a site that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern man from different eras, including wall paintings, remnants of tools, and so on and so on.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools dated back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that is very reminiscent of the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal were found on the site, which apparently passed through the process of production of such popular flakes today.
With it, the grain is soaked today first, then dried, removes the packaging, so-called plush, then melts and dissolves the surface.
In the cave of Paglicci, a grain was discovered, which was, according to all, reloaded or saved, and then apparently torn between two Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n stones - at least evidence of the use of two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists were unable to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that the complete process of the production of the flakes would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps even warm, is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flotilla interpretation is correct, the oldest flotillas have survived agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the report of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnus<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova, P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>zrak, Frazova, Sprateck<0xC3><0xA1>.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting with a male voice was a bit less understandable than before when the stops were reporting with a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is more discernible than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the passengers themselves - I do not know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose this from the studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the framework of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but the foreigners from abroad who don't recognize themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are intended, they may be confused and confused
Perhaps the choice of the loudspeaker - but better again the loudspeakers - should be made again, and this time colored by the usual traffic noise and the motor arm, in which the squeezing of the loudspeaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that they no longer have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Her<0xC5><0xA1>pica, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rova, or Ponorn<0xC3><0xA1> in the sparkling side, to which I moved in Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
I assume that my old-fashioned hearing didn't get worse all at once during the same day that the voter's stops changed.
I understood these reports quite well the other day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trailer's notes.
Today, few people know what the so-called complex checks were for the parties’ governments, the largest and the smartest.
I allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I went to the dispatcher's office when it was seven o'clock on the radio.
"You're lucky you didn't meet your co-captain, came a minute in front of you, and it doesn't seem like he's in the mood," the dispatcher remarked, as I wrote down in the coming book.
Thank you, I'll take a peek.
Write to me that I'm going down the ridges on a little mechanization review.
It's not going to work, it's a test today.
Everybody's out of this shit, all right?
What's the point?
'You'll see, 'said the dispatcher.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the door of the principal’s office opened, and the principal appeared.
Swollen, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling unicorn.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, and quickly turned on the two buttons of the bag.
"Good morning," the answer sounded, and I quickly ran to the second floor, without realizing the cold, evil tone the old man responded to.
'You're playing, 'said engineer Eva, an older lady whom I cherished very much.
She said she was even the chief before the comrades sat her down.
There's checks, and you're gonna get a hit.
How many times have I asked myself what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk much about it.
They say they live once in three years, they all have to, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
But I think I'll see.
I pulled out a file with periodic reports and a phone call.
"This is Holcman, come to me right now," said the chief's voice.
What's poisoning?
Now we met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I have come to your command," I said, barely entering the principal's office.
The chief sat down at the desk and looked at some of the lanterns.
"Comrade mechanizer," he said after a moment, without raising his head, and still looking carefully at the laser, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the chandelier at the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared straight at me with an ordinary, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I found out.
What's going on?
Even yesterday, the deputy praised me for having worked very well during the few months in office and for being extremely pleased with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the cell at a distance.
And now this?
I realize you're a track distance technician, and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I've said that I've used this greeting since I was a kid, that I've been so educated, and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red snake on a duck.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," he said.
And besides, you're still picking up calls from seniors.
One time you'll say "lord" and the second time you'll say "comrade."
But I'm not a boss for you, I'm a co-captain.
The deputies are the comrades of the deputies, the high-traitors are the comrades of the high-traitors!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job, or the co-worker... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," said a coldly angry chief, who had calmed down a little in the meantime.
But there will be talk about it.
Anyway, keep in mind that you don't have a prepaid retirement seat up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn’t his preference, it didn’t look good with the person in question.
He was staring at me for a moment with a cold, prickly look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also struck by his increased squealing.
He was only a few years older and played godfather, actually godfather.
He's vivacious, suffocating, authoritarian, arrogant, just like he's been doing right now.
They all went to him.
Come on, he's the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-partisan, said.
But the chief was fond of many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
He just shot me in the ass.
I thought about the ass, and it took me a long time not to shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the potato bar, that's to keep doing the boring officer.
What would I like to have two kids?
And for that, a bartender!
I was in a bad mood, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can do so far, you can go," the chief's audience concluded, and he began again to scan the larynx, which he had previously held in his hand.
At 12 o'clock, they called me.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions of what and how, they answered that yes, that it would be good.
It was only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in's habit that he was so used to, that they couldn't throw us all out, because the work would have to be done by the co-chairman himself with his faithful, and that he wouldn't risk it.
The word "cowardly" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man was shooting at me in the morning.
It was a nice meeting in the principal's office.
A co-chairman behind his desk and at a long advisory table other co-chairs who were to decide whether or not to be an official.
Kadrov<0xC3><0xA1>k, President of ROH, Registrar of Personnel, Special Purposes Referee, something in a way contrasts with the military, and Deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
An ordinary track worker, shoved his butt or threw a gravel with a fork.
But also a former baker.
It was rumored that there was no joke with him at the time, it was a pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the criminal was fired, he ended up on the bar at the butcher's.
But co-worker, yes, co-worker was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little sniffle in my throat, an indelible sniff.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k read the judgment of the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a verdict from the street organization of the party.
He copied the judgment from the civil committee, maybe they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the party’s long-time members refused to appear before the commission and subsequently resigned, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The clerk noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief said he was going to continue.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the National Committee, I also had a wedding in the church.
I have disappointed the confidence of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was expelled from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
In doing so, I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the chieftain read, only the chief's squeezing of the pencil into the tabletop interrupted the tight silence.
Everyone was looking at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
And I kept repeating in my mind, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I rather stay with the mercenaries?
I was able to fix the deviations without any damn checks.
But now?
The career of a grieving official took its toll before it began.
Back to the tent?
I don't think it's gonna work. I'm sure the chief will be there for an hour.
"Society, in what way did you check the co-worker being discussed here?" interrupted the slurred chief with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to the pre-employment judgment.
You got him here?
Apparently, the cadre was not overreacting.
He squirms in the shorts, squirming nervously, as if he himself had been examined.
He nodded and gave the chief a piece of paper.
'Well, 'said the chief, with a sign of gravitation, which, however, was often the forerunner of storms.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with honors, studied industrialist, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, met the standard on average by one hundred and twenty percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get that judgment from, Comrade?" he turned again to the cadre, who felt that it was beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even have to be a cadre.
This is where my partner gave it to me at the start.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the district to the chateau," said the chaplain.
And there's no judgements required, his was kind of extra, so I put him in the file.
"So, when you were included in the technical function, this pile of paper was enough for you," the chief noted dryly.
The officer was nervous and had no answer at all.
"It doesn't matter, we'll discuss it later," said the chief of staff, and apparently relieved the officer.
For now, he's stopped.
"So what about you, Comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes were dark, I was hot.
He followed the whims of reading and accusing, and I knew I was the most resilient creature in the world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by substantiating the incomplete judgment I stated in error the colleague of the cadre rapporteur, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist creature who, at the time of building real socialism, supports the ray of religious darkness, yes, even participates in them.
That there was a lot of things I did, or maybe I still did, and I prayed quietly for it to end.
I didn't care.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they took me to the dumpster.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the co-chairman.
'That would be enough, Comrade Chief, 'said the party's chairman, and sharply interrupted the chief's levitation.
Here the co-worker made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just made a fool of himself!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated baker spoke like a book.
Where did it take him?
Is he so numerous or did he parrot phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
Chances to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, a somewhat mistaken co-worker in his efforts to make amends!
It's your party duty that no one's gonna get rid of you!
In fact, it is a political obligation for all of us.
Here the fellow must see that the side has not forgotten him.
That as a loving mother he not only punishes, but that he also loves.
When the president was finished, no one fell.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the ice-cold chief insisted in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd have heard that's exactly what I was going for.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but it was clear to them that they did not believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the role of a separate caregiver for basic resources," I shrugged on my return to the office, and soon I cried out.
In addition to Eva's engineers, everyone was at lunch.
That silence listened to my incoherent portrayal of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked me if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and set the pots.
In the meantime, she was talking about cadre practices.
Like one sentence, often full of praise, they put a man in his hand, and the other, in which there is dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had to, but on the curb at the dumpster, so the co-workers at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our cadres?
He's just getting old where he'd eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"That's from the old man," she said, mistakingly.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful of him, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party president?
Basically, a much worse chief, no crowds.
Zero from a knucklehead with a lot of power.
The water for the coffee began to boil, and soon the office filled with the smell of coffee.
I shoved a piece of sugar into the pot and quietly swirled the hot lectern.
I guess I'm from the worst outside.
I'm not getting fired now, and it's three years from now.
Anyway, my co-captain won't forget me today.

The symbol of the town is alive.
The wind circle over Chlumem turns again after years.
It is visible from a distance, because it is located on a fifteen-metre-high mast.
People around him call it the "windmill of Chlum."
For the village, 150 inhabitants have even become one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the municipality acquired on the occasion of the birth of the people in 2010.
"We asked for a sign and the windshield we wanted to have on the sign, of course, everyone knows him around," Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Mashek said.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chumsk representatives decided on a solution, which was then appropriate until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch in <0xC4><0x8C>i<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>v, they let a depth of seven meters deepen the well.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 crowns," says the memorial inscription on the ground floor fence of the construction of the masonry.
The pump after several repairs and the fall of the windmill was extended in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began to be written: on that day, a new pipeline began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional common symbol and a rarity here.
The dominator was executed at this year's birth anniversary.
It was not until 2008 that Chlum<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xAD> decided that the wind turbine would be repaired and put back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but had to be lowered the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the right material and the bike could not resist wind gusts.
Then, for several years, the Chlumian Dominant rested under the roof.
However, since June this year, the bike on the high mast is spinning again.
On the occasion of the collision of the natives, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws usable water out of the well only to the indentation of the blind shoulder.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
It turned out to be at least empty.
"In the autumn, the shafts of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket will be disconnected again," explained Mayor Mashek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windmill was put into a municipal sign, but it is the only windmill of this kind in the whole of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
A similar element in the sign has to honor local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovici and Zelené Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erovsk or in the Police in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-match press conference.
At the time, we were coached by Georgi Hagi, it was a pity that we lost.
I'm hoping to score Sparta right now.
Only with the difference that we won’t lose this time,” Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is the key support of the Greek team.
As a striker, he will face the incursions of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, he says about the Greek battle of Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1>.
And he knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in Romanian Astre with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their games.
I know he's a very good assailant, so he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
Other players of the Prague club did not name, and so came a direct question if they knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and pointed at the Czech journalist with a slightly calculating look.
The look on his face was like, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot on the team.
He has a really good player.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fataie.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game," said Stanislav Hejkal, a Spartan assistant.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, from Steauy, but he went to Italy's Palermo, also playing for the Glasgow Rangers.
“We’re looking forward to an aggressive and unusual style,” says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
He is my favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
“Like Sparta, we will try to win,” Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is very happy with the competition from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading with the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken as part of the project so far are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague stock exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes a prospectus of securities, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding’s headquarters and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
As part of this operation, therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or to new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in Q4 2015 or Q1 2016," the company said in a statement.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech Television in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news report of Czech Television.
How'd it go?
When journalists at the Faculty will learn about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast of the Czech TV Event.
The migrant crisis was responsible for about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Only at the first minute when the <0xC4><0x8C>T reported on the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on the police officers euphemistically came to them patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current promigant propaganda - judge for yourself the names.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - The Story of Integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees are not only a threat, but also a chance.
Travel of fugitives - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms fugitive or fugitive and not migrant.
What’s most striking is that <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only and only pictures of small children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no resemblance to communist agitations.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got up to a panel apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I was moved by fish on the umpire's toilet.
The domestic fish, an insect with an imperfect transformation, i.e., the invertebrate that does not make from the caterpillar to the broccoli and young looks like an adult individual, is only small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't let them lose.
First by hand and later by chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals on their liquidation.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
However, it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some kind of juvenalizer, which the ants brought to the nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate a new generation.
But I turned it down.
As time went on, the insect became the object of my admiration, and more and more I came to the view that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that intervention in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the other.
The truth about fleas and puppies, I guess I wouldn't bother to worsen the karma of killing them.
In the new apartment, we agreed with our partner that if the fish don’t crawl over our necks, let the shells of the dead skin, some of the invisible algae, and so on, eat in peace.
Their quiet existence has been disrupted by the spider over time.
It was a common type of contortionist who sat on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived with occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he feeds mainly on fish and that their number seems to have kept him in a removable number state.
With confidential regular contact with every need we have made, we have found that it is a female.
After all, we were witnessing romantic engagements with a partner about a third less, as he carefully sniffed at the spider’s web, so he wouldn’t be eaten before he achieved the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love toys were played, we found the remains of a dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't bite for weeks.
When we thought she was already behind us, we were surprised by the amount of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
The work was eaten by my mother, the work was scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
The truth is, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of that squire of the toilet.
For some time from the ceiling she carefully observed our behavior and by moving under the toilet she evaluated our non-attack as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplicated fish decreased again, and the peacock was calmly looking for its normal activity to provide food.
Our ecosystem has not changed throughout the year.
Our daughter grew up to the age when using a nightstand was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already eaten the eternal pouring of its contents.
We offered her more and more emphasis on the use of the toilet.
However, her daughter found an excuse to keep her bad habit in the peacock she saw very well when she was dying.
Our talk about the spider being seen didn't take happiness in the house at all.
With tears and tears she forced her nightgown.
There was nothing left.
There came a time when the peacock, in the interest of the development of his daughter, had to judge.
It's all over me.
He was taken to a glass and shown across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I apologized to him as if I were a friend, but after so long acquiescing, I felt ugly as if I was throwing away a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometrical row.
The world's a wonder, a week, two, none of us showed up there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the peacock in the ants pattern did not grow there, that the environment of the toilet is not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of the medium size appeared, and they were already hemmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I realized that their connection to the spider had to have a cause in that when they don't see it, it's hidden somewhere else and they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some sort of telepathic connection with their predator, and its rapid disappearance in them caused some terrible reaction.
Rather, I don't have any illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light placidity, but that they would react to hand gestures or quick movements, it is not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the night.
All that remains is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether and I hope they haven't let me down after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of the genius scientist of the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deeply that the outcome was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the attention of people, above all, of his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also not possible to forget its clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so common to many that it prefers easy proportions for closer acquaintances.
However, it is not easy.
However, it would not have been Albert Einstein if he had not found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: The clock near your beloved seems like a minute; the minute in the hot oven seems like an hour – and that is relativity.
I allowed myself to choose from his entire plagiarism of famous quotes these ten that literally caught me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, brilliant people are trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
The only thing that can ever prove me wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the disorder on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in the fourth it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous and to know much is also dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem my life would depend on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I can’t forgive myself to introduce Einstein’s formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula: A<0x3D>X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Region are waiting for changes of 1.5 billion.
“It’s a success when we consider that all four are in black numbers all year round,” said Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k, the heavyweight champion.
The total profit of the regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million kroner.
The share in this has mainly higher wages than insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year as well.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xAD> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, it is thanks to this that it is inclined to build, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of time when we were mainly buying appliances, was over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care can not be done, the plans of the Regional Deputy for Health Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as justified.
He is looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
Construction workers will be coming to the hospital next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now choosing almost 300 million crowns.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> they have a planned addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to build a new intern for the open central pavilion this year for about 200 million.
And the long-awaited construction of a new central income and an intern is waiting for Zlin’s Bata’s hospital, which will need three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the most significant and often the most significant changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, for patients and for doctors," V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the hospital, said in a statement.
The five-storey building there is to be completed in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are markedly familiar mainly to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, only one toilet is needed on the floor, the beds are unsightly, the windows are impassable and the doctors do not have the right conditions for work.
“For example, our interior was built fifty years ago and is now at the limit of its lifespan,” said Pavel Calabek, director of the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital.
In a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building linked to an emergency reception.
Thus, doctors and patients will have all emergency departments in one place, in addition to in new premises.
The same model already has a finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income is already standing, and it will be internalized within three years.
"We will pay for the building from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sl<0xC3><0xA1>dek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still at its highest, and it did not come to a loss even two years ago, when the Zlin hospital may have faced a loss of almost two million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajd<0xC3><0xA1>k, who has an economy in mind.
Improvements are also expected to be made by patients of the chromatic hospital.
In ten to fifteen years, it will go into repair, new equipment and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance will begin.

No one has explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after talks with his European colleagues that other Czech states are pushing for quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also points out that so far no one has explained to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should be kept if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe in more detail the position you have taken at the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and of the Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot function.
We can't talk about migrants like sacks of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some vision, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We just solved forty thousand recently, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross over us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country, have an ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but we've already committed ourselves to accepting 15 hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there will be 1100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we did the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe whether we can detain the people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet there, it can happen that even the 1100 we will not keep in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to that Germany once they arrive.
If we are able to keep them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will proceed with the asylum procedure.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent of the population, according to European statistics, will receive international protection.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will resettle.
This is the second project that is breaking down so far, and there we have only made progress in discussing with the churches the possibility that they would be able to help them get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss the ministerial meeting with us.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity step that would block this discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is going to be a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany calls for all migrants from Syria to be able to reach them, the report will spread in the hours across all camps across Europe, as well as in Turkey, Jordan.
It offers another wave of migration that is heading for Germany, because they just don’t want us.
We believe that the road is to protect the external borders – simply to deflect those migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them that they don’t have a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovons came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the state representatives.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, those 50 percent of what the social systems are spending on them today could go to the refugees.
In contrast to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where is it going to go to make the border checks tighter?
We were afraid of arresting hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we will keep will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The only ones who take these people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
Where is the breaking point?
Does it have to be thousands a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days are running out of capacity for us to come up with crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately call for an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation were to arise, the government could sit de facto immediately and in one resolution decide to strengthen the police about the army, let the customs administration, or the prison service.
The final option is the exceptional condition that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can go that far.
Please note that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread horrendous information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more proof that the Hungarians will try to deflect the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last moment.
They are trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off her debts.
The footballers also got their money's worth.
On Tuesday, Slavia was suspended for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted by Online Services from Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
The legal representative of Slavia Zuzana Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlov<0xC3><0xA1> within a few hours that he had no intention of declaring a fall on Slavia.
Needless to say, she had an argument.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Shim<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the top club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent debt tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said legal representative Slavia Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Who did Slavia pay?
Both current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative of Milan Ivano or the Czech deputy of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Li<0xC4><0x8D>kovi.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexandru Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid debts to the city of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only the claims that Slavie disputes remain de facto.
According to the club, the commitments did not arise at all, or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by the withdrawal from the account," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> told the judge.
"Everything that was paid after the due date is paid," Mladkov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that only unpaid or dissuasive commitments were not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send out detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debt.
There will then be an evaluation of all the evidence.
Therefore, the decision can be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to be continued on the third of November.
The decision, however, does not fall even at this meeting, but only after it in writing.

FastMig X introduces the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything from welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, the simple setting and the expandability of the welding source allow you to react quickly to changing requirements, which leads to a reduction in simplicity, the need to switch the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding by cutting-edge welding processes, developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
It ceases to waste time and does not result in the waste of material or the correction of wrong welding.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less simplicity, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year’s news, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate this gesture very much, as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but due to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world’s leading manufacturers.
For those interested, the delivery times are certainly pleasant as well, which range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly continue to expand after the Brno fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi stores in Plze<0xC5><0x88>.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blanket was built so that it wouldn't fall off.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
It was even safer to wash the blanket, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanka was able to be built in such a way that there were no two landslides in Prague’s Stromovce, says the production director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon during a press tour of the tunnel.
However, he said it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoons.
It’s always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was able to stretch more safely, but the costs are increasing exponentially," Butovi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it started to settle more safely and cautiously.
"If these measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
Tunnel Blanka collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlava, the tunnel is too expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
The building was originally planned to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add to this the VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, out of the seventeen billion you have one-and-a-half.
Adding to this technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer that far from the 37, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx Profits Mixed, Decreasing Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the year-on-year profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a 20 cent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 per cent, which will be reflected in January 4, and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the company, said the company "represented solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday hire plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 workers, which is probably the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping reinforced the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while the profit declined in the freight trade due to higher prices for the labour force.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At its most anticipated session over the years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate after almost ten years.
Sticking over them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable year-end decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to start on a break from unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero deficits.
While most of the data shows strong economic growth, recent turbulence in the world’s financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed out of adding to the volatility by increasing its benchmark rate of federal funds – even by just a quarter.
“It’s clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for a pretext not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is already providing them with enough justification to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to delay the deal, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed raises rates only if politicians slump by promising that another increase is not in sight.
On Tuesday, the industry average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed politicians will delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates now," he said.
If the Fed did, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so that panic doesn’t go away.”
Other experts have argued that raising rates would calm the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was on track to raise the 0.25 percentage point rate this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, she expects rates to rise this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed, the labour market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Salary gains showed signs of a raise.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to wane at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The industry average of Dow Jones fell by 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared that slowing China’s economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat bounced back this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of its May maximum.
The uneasy market situation in the Fed’s political actors provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and former U.S. Treasury Department.
It now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data they can rely on regarding the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the currency authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A slight sign from then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “suck” their monetary expansion into the market, has unleashed squabbles around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed representatives can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Wealth Management Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of over-movements in financial markets that seem inconsistent with economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy making that pushed for rates to rise, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions “despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee.
The latest wave is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has two mandates and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter.
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market/store is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need some engine oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour before you pass all the streets.
If you’re hungry, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's In Stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C you will probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The expansion of the meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and drain you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-selling semi-finished products and more.
Who is shopping here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as independent families and individuals.
The wide alleys are lined with shopping trolleys and high-rise trolleys.
Found: Fresh monthong durian next to the chest of drawers.
Where is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by suburbs of the Chinese district and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highway will stay at the old one.
Acceleration to 150 km/h Parliament rejected.
It will not be possible to increase the maximum permissible speed to 150 km/h in selected sections of the motorways under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives decided to move forward with an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the speed increase.
The land communications bill will now go to the president.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that the law allowing a speed of 60 kilometers would be vetoed.
Against the increase, Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0x81>ok (for the United Nations) said that the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the bill.
The approved novella will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to the motorways, which could thus be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now come to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also waived the authority of the transport police to have the last word in the regulation of local communications, which are cared for by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the Senate, also relies on the possibility that sewerage, plumbing or public lighting cables could be stored longitudinally below the driver's surface.
This would save the towns for the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The novel also aims to help improve the protection of roads and make it easier for municipalities to deal with detachable vehicles that owners do not report to.
Newly, the municipalities could sell detachable vehicles, which are not registered by their owners within a period of six months after notification of the detachment.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic across their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines also for shipping companies.
The novel also removes the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of existing paper marks, which will be used after January 1 next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The mouthpiece goes to court.
He's been in danger for 10 years for the preconceived welcome of the parishes.
The case relates to the allegedly over-provoked Welcome to the City Council project.
The police also wanted to sue MP Zuzana Kailov<0xC3><0xA1> (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both up to ten years of imprisonment are at risk.
The main event is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the state representative Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k, they caused at least one million crowns of damage, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert judgment.
The former members of the city’s management, according to the plaintiff, have unlawfully enabled the company to gain the property of the company that organized the welcome of the citizens.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k, according to the complaint of the then head of the magisterial department of urban services, education and culture, ordered him to address five related companies in the selection procedure.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, applied for the competition, the city council abolished the competition.
The order was then to be given to the city administrator, and only Darothore was registered in the competition, which was then assigned by the city council to the order.
The city has paid at least a million more.
Both charges are aimed at ensuring that Darothore assigns a public contract to the organization of the Welcome of the Municipalities in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem in the long term and coordinated at least in contravention of the requirement for the proper management procedure.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that after obtaining this contract, Darothore subsequently calculates <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of the municipalities event, which will, in contrast to the real value of the services actually provided, be disproportionately increased.
In three years, according to the document, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least one million kroner overdraft.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k has previously denied any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this constructed cause, said the former prime minister earlier, with the fact that the city under his leadership was only following a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," added Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Criminals also wanted to accuse MP Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Representatives did not prosecute her.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but count on Kaila to be charged after her parliamentary term ends.
The welcome of the municipalities was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly let the dog on the run.
Then the journalists were forced to delete the record.
Hungarian police on the border with Serbia briefly detained a cameraman of the AP agency and forced him to delete a record on which the police dog allegedly crashed into the country of the refugee.
The Hungarian government, however, has questioned this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the cornfield near the Hungarian city of R<0xC3><0xB6>szke crossing the border with Serbia.
Cops stepped up against the refugees, and one of them left a Syrian to attack a dog with a basket on a stretcher.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," he barked, Muzi says.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything, one of the police officers noticed him and refused to let him go.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had uploaded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
The museum thus lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
The behavior of police officers in it has called it unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover up events without risking physical violence and not have to worry that the government will destroy legally obtained material.
Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs questioned Muzi's police report on the incident.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare and scare a little, but they certainly didn't attack," says Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
The Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning the City will kick us out, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, head coach of the hometown City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not a single team made a lot of chances, but we had the ball on the balls longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not tactical, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team was in the competition after a long 636 minutes.
This finalist of last season Juventus on this was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as a defender has only a point and a score of 2:4 is up to 16th place on the table.
And so turning to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, it will kick us in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents before the new year - Pirla, Téveze and Vidal.
Pogba, Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x8D> and Morata were represented in Manchester.
"It's true, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to it we'll go to the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is well deserved by my players.
"In front of our equalization goal, we could have inked at 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," said coach Allegri Goalman Buffon.
"We've burned a few good chances," said Yayu Touré, City's backup.
We have to take the experience of the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Bye, Angelo, bye, old Germany II.
Before we move on to the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the entire media frenzy around them is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also the session.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents’ hands after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically causes a feeling of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here desperate children, look at the pictures of landing boats to the Greek islands, that the child is not so much to see on them!
Well, somehow, we've recently disappeared from television images of ships heading to Lampedusa, fleeing from the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie on its beautiful promenades.
A lot of young black people.
And there's also pictures of Callais, where these men eat, and the black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he cares anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it was a fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it somehow hides the fact that it is not only the unhappy children from Syria, but also the stylized - for the elderly: fashionably spoiled - young men.
Their muscles look like they've just come out of some fitness center.
There is only one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite being private, a large group of cars came to the beach at once.
But no hams.
And the young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in branded clothes and shoes. In the hand, how else, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've planted all the beds.
He who did not lie on it and was just at sea, had misfortune.
They were dressed like they were from the American rapper film.
On the heads of the hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they went to the local beach bar and started to walk.
They sat down at the tables around them, leaning next to the sitting lunch and white guests at the bar – reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking questions.
Mothers and children fled from the dining room terrace somewhere in peace.
The incoming blacks drank beer directly from the third - as in the series from the USA?! - threw empty bottles around the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't in English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in brand swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, in the water they screamed and screamed, mothers with children and retirees fled in terror, and in half an hour there was no longer a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff was afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it at work," said the waiter.
I remember, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had on his neck about twenty centimeters of massive cross of gold.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
'You've seen them bark, 'said the waiter.
Drugs don't fit, they don't even eat.
They're doing something completely different.
So I already knew what they were feeding.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known it first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were sent to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, such as intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized major power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of the pictures of the Moscow TV from August 1968.
Sure, there were a couple of sunbathers at the station, but mostly - the ancient Germans - the Muslims welcomed their soukmenovets.
For many weeks they have been talking in Czech TV news, as some research has shown that Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
However, who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to receive even more refugees a week ago.
This was also reported by our TV.
However, they hid what happened the next day in Germany: that in a poll vote on the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the polls involved 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago, that “our effort on ‘multi-cult’ society has failed completely.”
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such a co-existence have failed completely."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to her, she did not witness a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live next to each other without being integrated. They live here with us today and we have complained for some time that they will not stay for a day.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily next to each other, has failed this approach.
Totally failed.
But even Merkel has no power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly has no maturity in the European Parliament - yes, that's the one that Berlusconi in the EU parliament said he could play the supervisor in the centre from minute to minute - has already shown himself repeatedly.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has surpassed Rubikon.
Note that until some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the citizens of countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have, for years, tried, at least from the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany there is a devil of aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when, with all his might, he stopped the attempts of the Grand Dukes to control the whole of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was abandoned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Greater Germany, which led Germany and Europe to two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism.
We'd call it sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the rise of German nationalism, and thus left all those fighters against the atom in peace, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better everywhere in the world, fully leaned on the side of the fighters against warming the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called propalestin - and an anti-Slovak stream that considers all Slavs a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents Jews, was primarily a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements by Schulz and the German ministers show openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leader of Germany.
Which one needs to be listened to without an excuse.
You don't mind!
And if we combine the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, capital, especially German, is behind it, which is the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudoscience of the sunflowers first led the Germans into the abyss of environmentalism and multiculturalism and today brought them home and perhaps even brought millions of Muslims.
Who, annoyed by the siren's voices, soon encounters a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they start to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours by force, again a part of its inhabitants - but it seems that an increasingly small part - can become ideologically popular, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Is Germany going to burn again?
The Muslim hostel is on fire.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the incoming Islamists erupt?
To whom will the Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time come to help, but certainly not assimilated in such a way as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of their country, are allowed to enter?
What will it do with the Germans, and even with Germany, when the people who will be vocally and publicly protest against the new Euro-superhuman Muslims are raised?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict, which in Europe has provoked with the support of the solar system ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elite and, in principle, the totalitarian, and their impoverished banks, is growing.
And because of the inadvertent action against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the submissive and disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finished tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders is to scare them to death.
It is enough to knock and the robust knock on you will ring in a way that the weaker nature does not have to stand.
He will guide you to the right path, and he will guide you to the right path, and he will guide you to the right path, and he will guide you to the right path.
Maybe it’s a pity that the talking stick can’t be acquired even in reality.
We would also like to have a lot of jokes and jokes going on here.
Rosewood (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it's between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is part of the expansive weeds, but apparently creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easily adaptable, modest and uncomplicated.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth watching it and photographing it further.
Under the microscope, there is only beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women knowledge about the importance of a good diet in breastfeeding using images of children sucking from the breast painted with an image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and newly-baked mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased caloric intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, though Nine's is trying to take over the leadership in Today Show
With the departure of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra due to cover costs as a result of a liberal leadership leak, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
Morning show Nine broadcast from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is set in London as part of a week-long international television series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It didn’t seem to matter so much to Aussie TV’s viewers on this tyranny of distance because it averaged 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers broadcasting Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its valuation compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343,000).
Today in the last few months fills the gap on Sunrise.
In August, Today averaged 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
Winds of change are affecting more this morning than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the applause!

The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to New Zealand’s seafront, has an average of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson would be able to hit a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's performance indicates a clear "yes".
The X Factor from Seven has left a strong 1,136 million viewers, beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-ups on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television quiz (from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.), introduced by Andrew O'Keefe, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators — which was enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia rating from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia was replaced by the Million Dollar Minute series, which failed to defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who to choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may not want to know who will win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in an insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who remain state will definitely not reveal who the real one is, who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski, and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they told us thankless who would win.
Sam Wood Holds His Tongue to the Quarterfinals
All three women sang lyrically about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as the reasons why they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who will get Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and the Markos quickly named Mackay as the one who, in addition to them, preferred Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in a relationship together ever since.
“From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think about it during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really grounded woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a great couple with Sam Wood.
She herself claims that during her last visit to her home, she realized that Wood could be "so right."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked myself who Wood would choose if not for her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snow and Lana indecisively.
Bachalor airs Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams were wondering about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first digging out of the vault at a Tuesday win at 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after hurting Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of cheering the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught in submission when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio dub Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn’t imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's the whole thing," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own locker room led to the Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with the fans, on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in the debate on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested on a Siberian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. has become emigrants who have paid for the property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the two turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The Court first granted them the requested amount, i.e. more than SEK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by admitting to them only less than SEK 90,000, with reference to the fact that the amount of the compensation is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The emigrants became the Supreme Court and awarded them the amount originally claimed.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, however, appealed to the U.S.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic relations that the compensation granted under the then applicable legislation - although it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the derelict property - today only reaches a fractional amount of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the detriment of the secondary participants, as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been exercising their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant compensation to the household before," said Justice Jaroslav Fenyk, a spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
"The U.S. has repeatedly stated that the general courts should act in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies should not be interpreted in the interests of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation should always be achieved, i.e., the elimination of the property crime of wrongful convictions," he said.
Evita in the musical Studia DVA will now perform Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>n in the first Czech presentation of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timelad Rice in Prague.
Returning to the same role, he says: "To this day, Evety's efforts have not been matched by the power of the performance."
Avoidance is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, she was recommended by Monika Absolon.
I have seen the monk three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
All of a sudden, I saw a whole new concept.
I'm a big fan of modern editing, but this one's just special.

The planned transfer of the musical score between the two singers will take place at the Christmas concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 from 7 pm in the Studio DVA theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Feel Your Cry, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also jump from the director’s desk when he will represent himself during the filming of Karl Roden’s film as President Per<0xC3><0xB3>n.
Due to the public interest, additional terms were then added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita presents the Studio DVA theatre in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.

Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against the new state constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district official, says more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern Nepalese mountain range, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a major step forward with the new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators in Kathmandu this week voted on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely shouldn't panic now.
After the loss on the ice of master Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov you did not manage a home duel with the Spartan hockey player (3:5).

The NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-altitude system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent likely to develop tropical cyclones in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-altitude system, roughly in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, is also 60 percent likely to develop tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast said.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign aimed at selecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud published the report on her blog on the basis of her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is increasingly more families, like my own, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief site will double to $5.5 million.
Europe has faced the largest wave of refugees since World War II, with the largest number coming from Syria in a four-year war that has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many people also flee the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics could be a useful weight loss surgery
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mild obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“Death data takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery are used to reduce the stomach of various methods.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicate a person’s overweight and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a 2007 study that deals with two types of bariatric surgery – stomach bypass and gastrectomy – in the treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes mellitus.
The mean BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to a study.
In the meantime, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained approximately the same at the value of 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drugs treated group, only 1 percent and in part only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol have been shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the body's ongoing blood sugar level.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers say.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" — which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group with the bypass lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved higher decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 versus 2.1%) and were more likely to have a 16.9 percent reduction in diabetes.
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of more powerful people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had a 29 percent higher chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, this is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI,” he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the decline of patients with BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to show the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes, which firmly link their bodies with obesity and sugar, the way back is already really difficult.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to grasp all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Being a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also voiced complaints about George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the violent US response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have consumed a sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have ingested a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of use of sanitation products in children under 12 years of age who were reported to the control centers of the food increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the remedy intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers how to drink a sanitary napkin because of cheap habits.
For decades, they were reportedly mixing a sanitizer with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
"The kids don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (sanitary) products are those that are perfumed.
To deposit are sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few bows can mean alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s Control Toxicology Center at Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t want to let a glass of whiskey go that way, too, but people leave these sanitizers out, and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently spotted up to four holes of a strawberry-flavored sanitary napkin at school and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency.
The doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and burst into the head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said CNN's Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for them to be sanitized from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after ingesting a sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors thought the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their “bad” teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room, according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and has banned their presence in the room.
The police assessed the derailed plan as "innocent oppression," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
F<0xC3><0xA1>ma: No inconsistencies in the Celtic team
Griffiths debunks the Celtics' disagreement, while Delia admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it around again.
The Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new January strength will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their jump over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty in ADAMA Rooney's bid secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing Dons to gain a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Denies Talks of Inconsistency
This situation caused a rift in the Celtics, which was denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers backer and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic – because there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, says: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because there are no Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old company.
They talk about both teams together, and they're interested in that.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Company games and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back on the good, Deil's committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit sloppy, but the Norwegian boss pledged that things would turn back to good.
Malm's defeat and the subsequent departure from the Champions League were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point jump.
But Delilah says, "Celtic has had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about current events.
We're all the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support, because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with you.
Warburton is worried about the January strengths
Despite the comments that came out a few weeks ago and hinted that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is worried about a big buyout and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
Brentford’s former chief executive said: “The ice transition window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who come in the summer have the entire pre-season period to settle, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celticu Michu’s Transitional Goal Suggests Retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after the termination of his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old gunman has been having problems with a prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent into the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by Judge Collum, who was recalled.
Neilson stands behind his claim and states, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths pledges to avoid Tynecastle
Hard-headed Hibbe was severely punished after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Sk<0xC3><0xA1>cel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a horrendous moment," the attacker said, "and I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless it's in a Celtic jersey."
The Council of Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United’s board still believes in correcting the situation by running the current team – but admits that the downfall on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for a "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to stick against Hamilton Accies to get a seventh league win in a row and a five-point jump ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s a cup or a league, without winning this type of game.”
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK's overall unemployment is on the rise
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that in the UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, and the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell said in a commentary to the latest data: “The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we witnessed further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment grew, while unemployment declined.
Why I Witnessed the Oklahoma Execution
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will watch the execution of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip, who'll be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws near, I begin to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch the executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being conducted to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch the entire execution unobtrusively.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and I have created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one and a half hours of visits.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won’t be allowed a notepad and won’t be able to record what I see.
I will soon have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as promised, get access to it.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help to fight the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist at the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts that I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would have made him guilty of a felony.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love dying with an unnecessary death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
The Canning Vale guard remained dry after he rescued a man from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petra who flees to the police did not come out after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters from the policeman, who tried to convince him to return to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in during an incident that crossed into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
The guard Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiations."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove the car into a ditch to avoid the bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organisers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get him into the stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organisers and the Racing Victoria Integrity Department and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrapping of Lady Tata while maintaining the day of the race, which was his last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin's positive cobalt cut, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue about the charges of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you all at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I would then have to consider what I would do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man — whom I will name after the question — and offered him a job in my stables to find out about the things that are going on in my stables,” he said.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If so, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they totally burned me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it even today.
Should I think it's going to be a personal matter?
Will the RVL allow itself to grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe I need to take my license and throw me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I'm going to press on them and I'm going to carry a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's cold frustration increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt including Lidari, and recent scratching in it sparked the feeling that "he could have an hour of his license on the table."
Mood, best known for the preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the treatment rule on race day as "laughing" after an aluminum cladding or mud was applied to the feet, which is against the rules.
It is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone from my team mistakenly put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened too.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the cladding on the day of the race, to which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who caught was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra on the weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie admitted to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in the event of an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy returns to rivals due to wrestling claims <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' actions as "fixing the plan" by two NRL fans of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, the Sydney Roosters coach, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during a controversial Storm team victory in the final of the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, head coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying finals over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "overview" of rugby league and according to him two of Queensland's "no-winners".
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two top coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, in the last few weeks we have only focused on contact during the steps, and that meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously is training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come to this part of the year.
Bellamy misjudged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "naughty" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game, which seems to him to be cancelling, especially his young backups with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style – but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It stimulates more self-confidence in me because they say such things because they are afraid of fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the game Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the game of the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I didn't look at it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. The tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets bail of $200,000 for drug charges
The man who faced a possible lifespan of holding 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was smuggled out of Queensland, received a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomer in August.
Maksimovic was seen at a meeting with the defendants at the port in the morning and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial quality cocaine, lawyer Maximovice argued that there is no evidence that he would own the whole quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop completely by accident and innocent.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maximovic would escape.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the coronal case, the police lied about where he lived.
Maksimovice's mother and father-in-law jointly offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were apparently insufficient, as the accused did not make further contact with the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will observe a ban on departures from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophiles used a 11-year-old girl’s phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then spoke and found that she was missing a phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogga.
She passed him, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police engaged and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a “worrying” search on the web using expressions to search for uneven images of children.
Hogg later claimed to police that his reason was to “put pedophiles” on the Internet before he “defends that he is a police officer and scares them.”
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's a dependency - that he's dependent on the fear of people.
He admits that he did a computer search, but claims he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he was doing it to attract them.
He claims to have jumped into his drunk life and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw rough pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to be able to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or providing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14, last year, violated the terms of the bail on January 25, and failed to reach a hearing at the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he may argue that there was "no substantive sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his sentencing.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has made a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also confirmed by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous threats from the killings that alerted them to Mr Mugabe's writings during his speech.
Last month, he was drafted and challenged during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the parliamentary club of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show up, but it's called 'death'," Mugabe told reporters in a statement.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as it expires from parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services to the enterprise.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing operations of enterprise hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Management, who will be at the head of the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today’s HP and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion after the company’s announcement and “will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
This would result in the distribution of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says fellow players must get injured by Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play Christmas again.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is obviously uncertain.
The great damage to this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after injury to the ankle and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's not something special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be purely medically true, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern here.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years he played only in 65 league matches of Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the spelled circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition,” says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begin the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not move to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to appear.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite of the F-Group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most terrifying stadium in Europe.
Dinamo have also not been defeated in a total of 41 games since last season's "invincible" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree earthquake on Wednesday night.
This was the sixth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco, and he remains a distant hope that the club will lead to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
It never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views on various shows is striking in the eyes, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicide among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) named 2015 as the Year of the Man whose goal is to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a high enough percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems occurring.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be attainable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style rather than the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined not by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s frequent victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’s desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying “to deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the events that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights small moments in a man’s friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support has to come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So, if you’re going to a Comedy Central station at FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reworked.
Or if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile at them and say hello to them.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - a total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria suffered and helped PSG swallow Malmo's side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after the opening shot against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG beat Sweden’s Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started their way in the Champions League final with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent the French champions for the win, but then they threw a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal in the head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarter-finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it wasn’t the classic performance of Laurent Blanc’s team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a loser in front of the gate and was later substituted against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
“In the Champions League it’s not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we’ll have to improve with the process of the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I’m sorry we didn’t shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to PSG, which at home this weekend held a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was shadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man moving PSG in Europe to a new level after the Manchester United transfer that took place last month, and showed why when he ran for Marca Verratti’s pass to defend Malma and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the far corner.
However, if someone expected it to kick off a great PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs and got into this phase, joined with 9 internationals in the base and five defenders and two withdrawn backers were a heavy contender.
But apart from the Nikola Djurdjice shot, which just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa's gate in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves were concerned about the benefit of the attack with bad recordings and a miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot hit the net for a short time.
However, he turned out to be much more suitable when it came to preparing a chance for his team-mates and it was precisely from his recording that Di Maria sent a revolving shot that ended up in Wilando's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent for the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic beat him after scoring from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make something out of the match, and only the brilliant action of Wiland from great closeness bore David Luize's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the conspirator was not the goal of the conspirator Eze.
Malmo Age Hareide’s coach later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: “Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year.”
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Downstairs to Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion to Sell Shares
Mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by a commodity price crash, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold a new stock worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a commodity price slump as China’s slowdown in the economy lowers demand and ignites a spike in market destruction.
The rights issue sent Glencore’s stock price to the top of London’s stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of broader plans to reduce their debt by $30 billion, which has accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which was a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1.3 billion shares in the total price of 9.99 percent per group were eliminated.
Concerns about the extension of China’s growth curbed the price of iron ore by nearly half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visits Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in Barack Obama’s response to his visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and calls for cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he meets several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and will then continue to New York at the U.N. September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to resolve contentious issues, including Washington’s fears of China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis ravaged the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not far-fetched the European crew, but already force the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as it steps into the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than fighting more over the future distribution of refugees.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of runners, it is first necessary to filter out those who are coming today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for the management of migration," the EU's foreign minister said in a statement on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
By doing so, the central power makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also thinking about it, although with different intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
It is a domino effect, but it also sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entrance checks in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the country.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed this intensively during a private interview with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new at all, but it is being realized.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprints taken.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it is more afraid than others that the camps in which refugees would gather on its account will not remain on its shoulders.
The real black hole is still Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as it has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum-seekers, who came directly from Syria after passing the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has put their hands in the air.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and is now a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The Juncker Commission has promised that checkpoints will be put in place as soon as possible, but it has not set a number or a date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU's interior ministry said on Monday, mobilising on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum-seeker capacity and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the emergence of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-old has also pushed the issue of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees backed by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the Eighth Amendment.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The single firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been agreed in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, three of which are believed to be Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
The previous media reports said it was about Poland.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious foot injury.
According to the AFP, the dead were mostly forty-one.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims were also transferred to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the mountainous area of Pelvoux under the summit of the D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
"The narrow avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, the eight-member group had a huge amount of snow at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn the area of bad weather today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: Finally a real Europe.
During his Premier League debut, coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> managed to pass through the predecessor of the European League to the base group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan at the start of the main phase of the competition welcomes the 2011 finalist Bragu and according to the coach wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout battles, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every incautious game, we can play our tactics and we’re not tied with just doubles.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Braga is considered a top team.
He will be very active, have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he doesn’t have a name like that, but in his squad he has a player who probably gave Manchester City three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the top level of the teams," Trpishovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But he doesn't consider Brag a clear favorite.
I take it that we play at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we've shown that we're strong at our stadium, both in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team has lost only the inaugural Super Cup in Pilsen from this season's 11 duels.
He believes that Liberec can also force Braze on his style.
A team that is strong in the ball is waiting for us, but at the same time is not typically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 setup with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"He's a very heavy opponent, we've discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the pitch," Trpishovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In the forecourts we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we also adapted the trainings.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films are controlled by P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, an international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have registered their works in the competition for the 15th anniversary of the International Student Film Festival in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from October 15 to 18 at the Porty<0xC4><0x8D> cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which depends on the festival sound.
She's a detective this year.
Richard Blumenfeld, the director of this year’s festival evenings, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our investigation this year," Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student work - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, including last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, like every year, prepare an accompanying program.
Comes Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbosanson band Flying?, playing band Zrn<0xC3><0xAD> or for example Petra Hapkov<0xC3><0xA1> with recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photography exhibitions.
The first introduction of a graduate of the film school and the holder of prestigious awards, among which there is not even a shortage of it from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Assenbrennerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The second exhibition will approach the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
There will be a conversation with the cameraman and documentary Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the German film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the singer-songwriter Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hl<0xC3><0xA1>ch in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will cover his new book 3 friends from the city.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link that will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other, and develop joint ties and filmmaking,” he said.
This will certainly also help the Pitching forum, where students can meet with film professionals, run several job competitions at once, and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Its founders, spouses Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ov, organized the first year in 1997.
He was in sixth grade once in two years.
In the event of a CK collapse, insurance companies have to pay full customer claims.
Insurance companies should pay for clients’ claims in the event of a full-scale downturn in the travel agency.
She decided on this on Wednesday in the House of Commons when she approved an amended amendment to the Travel Business Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able, according to the template that aims to be assessed in the Senate, to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies with an obligation to pay customers’ claims do not agree even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the adaptation, argues the protection of consumers.
The insurance companies have already threatened to end the travel agency’s anti-crash insurance when it comes to paying.
However, the proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will have to either end up or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development Karl <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not euro-compliant.
It drew attention to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with Kalousk’s concerns on the basis of the survey between the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbing insurance," he said.
The statement of insurance does not consider Okamura to be relevant, and no official written statement of Okamura in this sense exists.
But they say they're going to find out if travel agencies are going to co-operate, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lowering the stairs to the Czech Travel Agencies, also warned about the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
He did not even go to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) with the proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of the alleged contradiction with the civil law.
Philip pointed to travel agencies, which he said could put consumers at risk.
In view of the Constitutional Court’s ruling, the rapporteur for the Martina Berdychov<0xC3><0xA1> (ANO) withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurers in cases where they could not know that insurance enforcement did not cover the entire risk.
The novel will not originally propose a minimum four million insurance limit for travel agencies offering air travel trips, and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus trips.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales from the sale of trips.
However, the limit of insurance performance will have to be such that in the event of a breakdown of the travel office it covers all the claims of the customers.
The standard also provides that travel agencies will have to re-introduce which travel agency organizes the tours for the trips sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment proposal of the Committee on Public Administration shall also be accompanied by further regular information from the insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and trips sold each month, on the total price of trips sold, and on the amount of reservations and sales for trips and for references to them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of its statutory obligations to the insurance undertaking, it will call on it to correct it according to the template or be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the obligation.
The novel also aims to re-adjust the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which it will always submit by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial spending plan and a prospect for the next two years.
However, according to the association, the presenter of the law did not think about the situation, what would happen if the insurance company pronounced the CK contract.
It will not be able to arrange tours and the clients who purchased the tour before the insurance is issued will be contacted by the association.
In this case, the CK suffers a significant loss and can also fail, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be a claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will act only as agencies in our market, said Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>, vice-president of the association.
According to him, the draft of the novel also includes the bank guarantee institute, but so unimaginably that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
According to the association, the change in practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will need to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
In the Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel offices.
This year, only three CKs ended their operations.
Foreign travel agencies sell trips worth about twenty billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must focus on improving humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees into Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting with the German prime ministers.
At the same time, she again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the member countries of the eight-member bloc.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are relying on decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German chancellor, according to which such a signal could be a higher financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and the international community.
"The Commonwealth countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this regard, the Prime Minister of Braniborsk Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by, among other things, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start more quickly with the integration of foreigners, the Prime Minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that the majority of the money that Germany spends on care for refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to take over the German language.
It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners are able to integrate, they can be of benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon discusses diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-Athlete filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate about diversity, arguing that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight interrupted the actor in the Brown series, when she stressed the need for alternative views about the Black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it with the film and not with the show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted with disbelief and breathed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when Mart<0xC3><0xA1>n's comments got in the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrelly to discuss the finalist shows.
“I’d like to appeal to people to think, be it the director of anyone, how they will behave in the character of Harmony,” Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that is a pawn packed by a white pawn.
The producer of Expensive White People sued finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon said their directorship "could finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disarray with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video's writing, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO MUCH, that it hurts."
Twitter has gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After being killed by a teenage Michael Brown white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national action and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made his mark on the movement, while introducing the album of the year nominees during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The Black Lives Matter movement’s most recent leader, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, presented a statement in response to Fox News personality question whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported to be on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional mountaineer and picker Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home a million dollars.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men broke into the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second spike after more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to do so within the set limit and thus became the first competitor to outperform a 4-pointer in the American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero outperformed him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the newsE! News immediately after his hard-hitting victory and it was known that he is still in shock of winning the main prize worth $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten doesn’t get any awards despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
"If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will win with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he's acting like a villain.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.”
Geoff told me, “If there was someone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed by the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk in the pink garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly reversed their defeat by defeating Minnesota in a 5–4 draw at Target Field on Tuesday.
The pair missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and grab a second wild card in the American League.
Although for just one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z, which for them was so unfathomable during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun and it doesn't matter how," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers striker Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead and Detroit scored three times in the first two exchanges and then took another in the sixth and ninth exchanges.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 fires and 3 rounds.
It was only his third consecutive game of the last nine games.
“I want to end this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to enjoy the game when you often sit on the bench and that’s why I want to get into the game properly.”
Tigers pitcher Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 laps and his first downloaded point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned on it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in the training, he lit up considerably better and he managed to get it into the game."
With three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of returning to the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton got the switch thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to a set thumb, and Simon fired Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only rival, Mauer, and in front of him was the batsman Miguel San, who fired the ball and ran two goals and left the right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on goals and a chance at a draw in the second half, VerHagen was able to send the third goal over two goals.
Plouffe has already scored 27 runs over two goals this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit retained the ninth place, Mauer won two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-wing cast Sana on three hits.
Detroit took advantage and earned points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers won three rounds in the first two exchanges against the earned right-hander, who entered the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I definitely didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I already felt like I could do better."
After repelling the effort in the first exchange, Hughes left one point to the second metre to Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hand polarizer J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the targets.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third-meterer Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored the next lap, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to run to the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second instalment when their forward James McCann and poleman Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and the score was 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"It got us to our knees," said Paul Molitor, manager of Twins.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won by overtime, finished in the third with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three goals, scored six rebounds and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-hander of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to pulled muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to appear in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will replace leftist Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and fight the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced by left-back David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he hasn’t played since August 20th due to muscle strain.
The Tigers and the Twins will play each other's third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), the Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will face off.
Xi calls for opening up the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday’s governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said of the 16th meeting of the Central Group to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of openness in birthing reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of the regulatory approach to the market, the release of border controls policy, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the limits of investment.
This system will be gradually tested and improved by means of test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that the companies themselves will decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad, and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or for a "green card," thanks to the optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and state representatives was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Chief Executives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In Karlovy Vary there may be a new bed division.
According to the Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Panik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the beds departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department, a one-day surgery center could be established, where according to the established concept, the performance of surgical departments that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on day-to-day surgery should be, it is not clear yet.
At the skin department of Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center could be established with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center that would take care of patients with brain disorders who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a device in the island hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is the bed of follow-up care and in particular the bed of the long-term treatment of the sick (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdka is insufficient and should be closely linked to the bed of care.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the bed of follow-up care is missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
The abandoned buildings could be used there after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease are absent.
These beds are lacking throughout the republic, so they could also serve other countries as the so-called Alzheimer’s Center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also be prepared for the introduction of so-called accompanying beds, on which the financial resources of the European grants will be released.
“These are beds that will be linked to specialized care and will provide space for translation of patients after a procedure, for example, after a cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedure,” says the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
