DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
"That's a question that, of course, depends on you getting into a conversation with him, talking to him about why he felt that one or the other apparently as it was in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasem<0xC3><0xA4>her" of the "Image-Zeitung".
Despite months of debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his retirement from the DFB team in July and also justified this by not defending Grindel against racist enemies during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim L<0xC3><0xB6>w and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to put pressure, but he knows it from football so that when “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t been made so far.”
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartenseitlung
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartenseitung, there was a risk of delay.
The professional fire brigade got out and found the hut in Vollbrand on arrival.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire protection to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery into the store at noon.
This may be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire -.
However, it is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collector’s items in his garden hut.
WORST MOM REFUSES: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Road
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to bring in the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she apparently wants the children to step in to a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial summary of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed to Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a potentially homeless family she wants to have become as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It aims to engage in adult child trafficking.
For all this, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing it right now,” Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earring.
Under tears, the actress laments how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheeks.
What Lohan has been motivating about this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so close that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 fatalities.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. stock market watchdog accused him of fraud, but now the two have agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
Party of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party’s agenda is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be eclipsed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, at the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name doppelgangers for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will agree on this Sunday – is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” stands as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" rework takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force is still there,” said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry newspaper Automobilwoche.
The arrested and paroled Audi chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the recovery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made “grave organizational changes” so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and intends to discuss further on this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities claim to have allowed the Audi chief to sell diesel cars with false exhaust values after the announcement of the exhaust scams.
He knew about the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, Managing Director Bram Schot is managing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Shot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already 15,000 reservations are available.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - In spite of criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel will once again run for office as DFB president.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make it as good as it gets,” Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio” early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, which I will do.
And then we have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "remarkable" if he did not "want to participate in the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been involved in the Summer March affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held on the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is expected to work in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
“I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would also advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters,” Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation that Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If one without a migration background clearly impacts society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration has to work,” Grindel said.
Proper weight loss with semi-smart scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index calculates the thing as well, but it is more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear record for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the dominant Berliner’s top scorer with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher with 24 points.
W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the 24-pointer with the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a marked success.
In the basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings outscored the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow supporters of the PKK or the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in use, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic League is critical because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music vs. Poverty: Stars, Vocals and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have joined forces in a concert in New York Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
“Encouraging yourself wherever you can,” Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday before around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed up at the multi-hour performance on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators held the sound of a falling metal lock for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Soon there was panic, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people off the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet, just like every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and spread on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, on the other hand, there were cheers and applause from the audience for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, leading many women to get their heads up.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects it.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also come together in an elevator with me at any time,” Flake said at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's draft
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the speech of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a strong disturbance, which is not acceptable.
That's why he caused guards to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe in front of the Turkish authorities: it was not until the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Y<0xC3><0xBC>cel had caused outrage.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
So fresh and good-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for wet-happy conversations at the Theke der Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schelfischposten".
Moderator Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to cheer up the mood and tongue.
Not a few promises also drink themselves up for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around, the actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Loudest Day".
The Municher got the trip to the high north but not well at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a fully fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful caterpillar.
Aimed at his fans, he posted some – perhaps not quite serious – insights that he has now gained: “Rule one: DO NOT go to INA’S NIGHT.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg licorice, which Ina throws at half-three, also lets go.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broths, fish broths or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves by the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller survived the nightly soaking situation is not yet known.
But since she moderated the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and injustice
The entrance to the 36-kilometer long railway track in the Red Riding Hood in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and polluted.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Sherben, cigarette tipping, garbage and dirt, demolished garbage buckets and now dismantled signs of notice - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the display object, the railway track in the Rotk<0xC3><0xA4>ppchenland is a more than an infamous sight.
Members of the ADFC-Gortsgruppe Schwalmstadt but also others have been involved in the topic for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich W<0xC3><0xBC>stenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the cycling council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the installation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the bid of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says W<0xC3><0xBC>stenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point on weekends to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, the bearings are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, garbage buckets are demolished, signs are bent over, sitting furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are upset that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for suction.
“There is a clear focus here on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill along the entire cycle path,” confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it becomes really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps that puts the threshold significantly higher to get away from the municipality.
However, this would require that a police strip be carried out in a timely manner.
In principle, desert hagen wishes for a development of the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
He had to be more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far, you can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany,” says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation on Ascher<0xC3><0xB6>der Strasse in Treysa.
There is no slope on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hills.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "K<0xC3><0xB6> von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "helpers star colours", three members and three generations of children from the C Trenka Trenka families.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the world.
What were the texts associated with?
In the places, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig chose the alley in his hit song "K<0xC3><0xB6> von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints to their creation.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has posted it on YouTube anyway.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special about the jury’s favorites – so that others can hear their songs too.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina T<0xC3><0xB6>lle.
Like everyone else, the kids appeared again in the final – and even without electronic support sounded “really good,” as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, access to the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfalen School of Music, Andreas Klomfa<0xC3><0x9F> from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, and Jan Kaven, chairman of the City Offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life as a result of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that face each other.
For each side there is a viewing screen, including four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after you have inserted them.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can also not read by accident.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3rd cube.
4th Party".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
It is not the terms that are supposed to be guessed here, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card, which may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" are supposed to be guessed not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he is to describe the terms "jumps", "fest" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not able to; for that wins the game if he succeeds twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prag" because he took care of the school and knows the window collapse there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side, but you can combine them better with any hint given by the encryptor there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the conversions should be, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But those who have just let go will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this unfathomable game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but for that it is much better to play in small groups.
And for those who are just about guessing and not about winning points, they can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man was twice employed by the Kulmbach police inspectorate on Saturday night.
He first showed Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the police’s notice of the place, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspectorate in the detention centre.
In its sober state, it must then also be held criminally liable for the use of signs of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig has been the spinning wheel in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, it was heard in full press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't wake anyone up.
The brakes were also quiet and the wagons were crumpled.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel’s home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which has its junction in Steinbach am Wald after an elevation of about 220 meters.
In order to cope with this, earlier trains and shuttles, which had their home in Pressig, were needed.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, a teaching workshop, a conductor’s and a railway’s masterpiece.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a 1899 conversion," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
From the railway works (BW) Pressig, which was commissioned in 1968 Bamberg, Loks was also operated for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steamers and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and push-blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished, the rest were demolished in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that no better use of the site, also in terms of freight traffic, has been taken into consideration".
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it came out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The ranchers and hemming shoes did the most difficult work in the train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with record-breaking success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking thirds is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russin placed at number 13.
The Swabian now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great ease, registered organizers and visitors were looking at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open ground of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition showed a great amount of visitor satisfaction.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for the opening of the vernissage.
He has been with us since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven young hands with a good perspective on the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and collaborated in the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.

50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albachteners also made air to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find everywhere that after the dissolution of the church choir "C<0xC3><0xA1>cilia" there should be no singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in Tinnenbusch, they raise the MGV 68 Albachten out of baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated big in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," thought Chairman J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Once upon a time they had revived the feast of the foundation.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was made to make festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "house of encounter" in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was suggested: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controls on and asked for the dance floor.
The singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound.
Suitable for the occasion were happy songs.
I said, “It’s a day as beautiful as it is today.”
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "R<0xC3><0xBC>desheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounds, which is the Latin term for "hoping".
Once again sovereign was the choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his guidance," Holstiege said, "He has such an easy way, it's a master performance that he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singingly.
The Ladies Choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was the art of sealing.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to fund the children of the Albatros Youth Centre for a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascent marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC M<0xC3><0xBC>nster under the patronage of Axel B<0xC3><0xBC>ring is really good in League three.
No trace of shyness or frack sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
“That wasn’t clear, but we’ve already left an impression,” says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately pledged to him: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is, in fact, an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish, such a game can kick," B<0xC3><0xBC>ring knows from many years of experience.
Finally, with its routine forces, the USC made everything clear and brought the full profit to the target.
“We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I’ve seen really good volleyball in phase,” Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately switched to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be possible after just three match days.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel B<0xC3><0xBC>ring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
In the fourth league, they don’t want to turn their eyes down any more.
If the vest is not dirty in the next few weeks, you need to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

About their marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she’s talking openly about the fact that the series may have had an accomplice in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, I traveled alone with a suitcase around the world and many colleagues I admired took me to eye level,” Keller says in an interview with the “Image on Sunday”.
At first, she had always been just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"He liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her then-husband might have been quite envious, but "how many men also shook Hans's conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted my fears not to know my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed”, as she explains further.
She has always felt “not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared rude and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas H<0xC3><0xA4>rtner, Keller once again said Yes, "though I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the wedding, I was sitting in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody’s marriage also failed.
Why has it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've come too naive to love."
The nightclub, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ-Resort Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich, has this time ventured to the ZFF-Opening Party.
Our diaper is not a motte, but still a little light-headed.
And the bright luster in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-lane square blinds it over a fee.
But it’s a stop film festival, because more or less celebrities want to shine in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he tumbles over the place to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the needs facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is struggling to create a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, the men's oasis smells like heaven for some reason.
So get out here, across the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have entertained at the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from all over the globe.
What you don’t have to do with an article about this festival is not to fall into the trap of advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moustache binds a ribbon around the feeler, which has put a good fee on it, and two bullish door-steppers actually swing him generous in.
Inside, the guests are urged to dance to live music long after midnight or be introduced by DJ rhythms, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite chops with C<0xC3><0xBC>pli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement, oysters wait for slender mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain sprouts.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Please wear a long dress, be careful on the escalator."
If it were two separate instructions, he would appear in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry picks up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for a brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is familiar to the observer is drawn: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character shouldn’t be far away.
And really: At the same time, Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty acting like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
It is not adapted, it is not known, it is hidden at the most.
Especially for this restraint, like to be misunderstood as slander, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is looking forward to the victory of his team.
Argentina’s football legend Diego Maradona appears to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fueled by the players.
The Mexican second-legist defeated Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: USA Send after last minute plea "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly grasp: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against H<0xC3><0xBC>llhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase “we slept totally,” the ASV-trainer became angry.
The housekeepers quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"But then all of a sudden a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
For the break, the remnant was only two more gates.
Especially Senden's best man, Marius Hintze, met at the stage one more time.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor’s perspective.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left at 15:15, after which the team changed almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then what?
Unpartisan action is taking place.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for blame on others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhoff cashed out, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and threw on the empty gate again and again.
You can only buy a little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," says the ruthlessly serving Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schl<0xC3><0xB6>gl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), police are searching for the woman’s remains.
On Saturday, the forces dug up a road near Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n.

With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials narrowed the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking in the web.

Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla’s electric car maker, has fled his impending recall as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and for three years, Musk will give up the office of Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The Chairman of the Board may remain against it.
In the comparison, which neither has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also ahead of SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he will perhaps take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the funding is secured.
In total, Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Musk later rolled back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the deal, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, appoint two independent board members, and set up a committee that oversees Musk’s communications.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the last few weeks’ hiccups, GroKo cashed several survey hits.
The SPD falls behind in a poll behind the AfD – Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has surpassed the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the large coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday issue at all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach.
The parties in the government consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a further 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve voting shares from 12.5 to 17%.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But the retention rate for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellor’s Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS found.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) actually wants the big coalition to hold the next regular federal election in three years, and 41 percent are for a new election.
Even in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been clear popularity abuses for Merkel.
The Germans are also assessing whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for it, while 44 percent are for it.
In the case of EU supporters, 64 percent do not wish to run, 35 percent do not.
Aushang at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says, in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintances stories - he should have a chat with Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for great love is almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxer shorts at the waffle table or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandkids than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is reputed to be less of a contact, but rather a sneaky exchange.
We have dared to test: How do women react when they don’t talk about the hot Brei for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Rule-of-the-art Hollywood love story potential has it when love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-rediscovered-plot.
If the guy then also reports to his followers under the email address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will certainly want to find her dream man, with whom she has chatted briefly about the “30 percent reduced organic putty meat”.
For her belief in the magic of analog dating, she certainly earned her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, then Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inner) to make sense of the lack of performance readiness on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the last game only a few inches past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen,” Fetsch praised his boys and looked up to everyone after the game to simply say “thank you” for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first half.
And chances.
But before his departure (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It would almost have been worth it when the SCA beat up Kevin Vollrath and Chris Neberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer twice in person in 41 minutes dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box – Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his craft.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entrance.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, fat on the left again missed a fresh cell course.
When Chris Neberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the platzers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The perpetrator himself appeared and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slapen struck in the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck, in the 80th minute, the leather in the penalty area was unlucky at hand.
Referee H<0xC3><0xBC>seyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive for a few minutes in the final phase, before Geske had the winner on the swing in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female on the 1st of September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to set themselves up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass by them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the U.S., UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with a few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the Medium Value Index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board of directors are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Of the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women stagnated.
Last year, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make any commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the share of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If women were recruited annually for the boards of directors, a 40 percent share would have been reached in 2023,” the report says.
Some even make Mise: Luxury Carousels: Which Manufacturer Earns the Most Per Car?
The best is Ferrari.
The Italians take <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280,000 with each sold Ferrari and make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profits per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers cash per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopopst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenh<0xC3><0xB6>ffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only gets around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are even putting a lot of money on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.
On her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she will become a mother for the first time.

In July, she married Harald Leemann.
She did not give the date of birth.
Torch train to open the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torch train, the Foreign Transport Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
At the start of the anniversary, the managers pulled through the place to the main square under the sounds of the toy train from Wiesenbronn.
In the already crowded festival tent, the chairman of the Foreign Transport Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Schulz and the wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of setting up something like this - this is a crazy performance for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later came out symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way back to us after the abtswind." Later, "The Troglauer" took care of the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the prices of beverages on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as it did 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest’s house, before going into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
When the vehicle collided with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerby was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in an emergency car collision with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztauto had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided at a junction with the taxi that was driving at Green.
The doctor's car slipped after the collision against an ax mast and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
The driver of the ambulance and the taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical vehicle were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from service forces.
The 29-year-old doctor who was also seriously injured was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another recuperating emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police determine in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor’s Office who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
Manchester United are now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League after being blamed out of the league cup.
West Ham United are subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is yet to be talked about.
Significantly, the scene was in the 74th minute, in which the regenerating Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball at helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had previously been inadequate over long distances.
The situation at United's City rivals Manchester City is very different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undisputed 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive line of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero managed a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper to secure the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also to jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slingshot.
After the Reds started the week with an unbeatable record, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp’s team in the Cup, thanks to the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also dropped from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 wins.
Fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the Hertfordshire surprise team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart booked an unlucky Alex Iwobi entry into his own gate, just two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third season hitter.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth consecutive win, and is again directly behind the great rival Tottenham at 5th place, leaving a strong impression on the rising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth consecutive time in a 2–0 draw against Southampton and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris car show in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the ring for driving bans and retrofits should not be let go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new features from next week, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn’t really play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are likely to be an important issue at least behind the shiny backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadter is expected to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext will not start until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4th to 14th October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
At least 380 people have been killed in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport connections are damaged, there was enormous damage to the property.
After the quake, the tsunami broke through the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a party.
It is feared that the death toll will continue to rise significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the Sulawesi West Coast.
Around 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcyclist Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der (right) from Herne celebrated the graduation service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Everking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the graduation service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the soul-sorcering concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle.
At the end of the season, the bikers traditionally celebrate in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform a service other than regular worship.
Already from 10 a.m. the bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a gentle curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the biker worship service by parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetically calm tones," said parish priest Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big feast: After the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and demonstrated to his amazing audience step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnels.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Many of the children could not yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple slices, which look a bit like a huckleberry, on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last work step was not so difficult at all.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the F<0xC3><0xBC>chttorfer farmer also had already filled specialties.
So he opened his " treasure chest" and presented the most recent spring whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drip "Made in F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up H<0xC3><0xBC>pfburg for themselves.
Activists from the F<0xC3><0xBC>chttorfer comrade of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited short-lived games at some stations.
Also next year, the home association will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Kr<0xC3><0xBC>tzkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the spargel village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: after all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season record: "Precise situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disillusioned Hannover 96 pros around him and gave them courage.
There were a lot of positives previously, however, not to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a terrible situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said Pirmin Schwegler, a 96-footballer, and he said, "It's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of precautions."
The further undefeated Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, stand at the bottom with two counters and are in their current constitution a candidate for absconding.
Led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46,300 goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general test for the Europa League game against Lazio Roma, scored seven points ahead of Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesse during his start-up debut and was never caught by Hannover's defence.
The stormer, long hit after the World Cup, with his pace and assertiveness, showed why he is so valuable to the consensus.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned from FC Liverpool, also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swinging.
Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3> (17th) had a falsified header on the Tornet for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence against Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term incumbent Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defended corner into the penalty area, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only had to keep her foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defensive player AJ Auxerre, who arrived in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to tank himself and left 96-yard goalt Michael Esser no chance.
In the middle of the season, Hannover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons now played a little braver forward, but brilliant ideas stayed out until shortly before the end, when the final hit still managed.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed it across De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest of the Frankfurters were only against overcrowded guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes the party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich’s mayor Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185 in front of a million people.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14th or Sunday after that.
The solemn service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and on which the legend is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It is not yet finished, only stands the altarpiece, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Reverend Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of religious service, the parish was poorly attended by the clergy.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing ended the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross.
For many years now, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting you to the secular part of the feast in the Catholic parish home.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm house.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming building measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be identified more accurately and the individual tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation comes more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the appearance of the eyesight by means of scaffolding.
The foundation plaster works are completed, the natural stone works are to be started before winter and we hope to be able to finish half of these works this year.
Opening: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for people with disabilities on M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
That in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e is now handed over "a very special house" of its destination - there all the attendees agreed on the opening date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller life support for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test bench for residents with cell phones: “The house had come in the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment,” Bader explained retroactively.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens a new home
Around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in the new construction.
The free state contributed 2.4 million euros to the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Help, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen with the many specifications had built a home that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need funds to be mobile".
The housing and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
“The property in this situation is a real lucky thing because it is no longer available in today’s situation.”
In total, the new residence in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three groups of dwellings.
Heinz is proud to be the life support manager for the eleven full-time staff, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Swiss complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, Deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all locals not to deal with the dismemberment of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain that to anyone for almost 30 years after the German unit,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is This Potent Dog Ending the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the wedges between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office said on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipients as early as Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the "accommodation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had been announced to the North at this year’s third summit between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the release of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, explains it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the facts - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not mantratically called for the "return to the case work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and fact work, but be it.
If the federal government is now so far away from devoting itself to its task again - to the government - it should not be stopped now with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and grievances of recent weeks will probably show on Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the government parties gather for the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly call this round to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the controversy.
But first of all, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make car companies with exchange premiums glancing away, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has seen an approach over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned Professional Immigration Act.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strictly against the "spur change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
It is not the same and the same that GroKo has joined together, but three partners with very different societal views and priorities.
The dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-established for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight – but always keep people’s lives in check.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus confidence can be regained.
This is why the people’s parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour in breach of applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
“Really day and night” had their legislated on social security reform, an over-the-top social minister reported at the presentation of himself two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatearin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>)’s statement comes as a surprise – she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She goes on to say that "the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce violations of the applicable service law in front of the cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "free her tongue from any suspicion".
Police are tearing up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n - Lange did not want to speak to the police about it.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is still closed in the Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters together with its guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Supreme Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said road.
For more than a year now, prosecutors and criminal police have been working on the case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the state road, 30 years ago, the body of Heike could have been clogged.
Color powder and eggs: crawfish in Barcelona before Catalonia’s anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But already before it comes to crows.
The separatists did not forget the police intervention from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with paint powder, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3,000 police officers from the police units Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year in the illegally classified referendum in the polling stations.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would have tried to break the police label by force, and the officials threw, among other things, colored bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, authorities said, according to a statement.
The independence referendum will be held on Monday for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision on the separation of the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid, Catalonia, had been placed under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to sit in U-Haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected inconsistency: FC G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh and RW Ahlen break up
Red-and-white Achilles continues on the spot.
Even at FC G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third light were released in front of 438 spectators at Heidewaldstadion as a collected unhappiness.
The first half was arguably overridden by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worrying.
There was no danger of missing a torch because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh Nick Flock scored in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option were the Achlens, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a 32-minute shot from the penalty area to a parade.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action consisted in an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian M<0xC3><0xBC>tzel, from 18 meters, just above the housing and after an hour, the freighters also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowded" the quickly presented counter over Sinan Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n with a shot, however, into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a Wieckowicz (66th) header after a corner ball by former bowler Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes G<0xC3><0xBC>ney for Sebastian M<0xC3><0xBC>tzel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Achlens did not form.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but neither did he.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood out.
“This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Woodwickede, and although our opponent did not want to play here,” said RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively, he “spoiled everything so little” against a team that “just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn’t feel like we could get an opponent,” said Daut.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too good for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table issue site, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
The sky turned out to be bright blue, but the space was still a bit empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it's so beautiful sociable, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent sense of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who were actually supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in shortly after.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors in the meantime musically.
This was so good that a few folk songs were performed later in the evening.
"It's just great," Marcel Kreimer said.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many assets with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a board at all," he thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were at the stands and also included the other celebrations held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful look - here goes something.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Kl<0xC3><0xBC>ck took the maikranz with the help of the fire department and brought it to the winter quarters.
At many stands was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative at his decoupage saw.
Furnishings, beer lid with drawers motifs and much more he had on offer.
A speciality was offered by three shrimp fields Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschl<0xC3><0xBC>ter.
The latter has a speciality in it.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The sociability is what allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have in no way procured a favorable way for the construction of a skating rink.
In several places there are corresponding lubricating plants, says J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the UN.
In at least one case, a criminal record has been filed with the police for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark f<0xC3><0xBC>r Lengerich!" appear on signs, among others at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign on the stairs to the Gimpt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an edging at the time, it could have been easily removed.
“A few days later, it was back, this time,” says Rottmann.
It is assumed that the corresponding banner must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without naming them.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that stand on the lubricated table.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the fire department parking lot.
However, this opinion was not implemented - too many factors appeared to be against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is from the City Council.
He is assuming a decision this year, so that a positive 2019 vote could be built.
Engpass in flight insurance gets even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the aviation security union, the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staffing note for European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years,” he said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-made batches is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal, state, aviation, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not go without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German Federal Air Safety Agency.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s regulations responsible for the loten-misers.
Traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost estimates and staff savings in the national aviation security systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "don't cut the air yet further".
At present, the EU’s requirements would be in line by 2024 and there are fears of further tightening.
The EU is constantly subjected to lobbying by airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs at the airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offers a "consonant training and future pact", Maas said.
The annual admission of 120 loten students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing structure is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Building
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the Group’s restructuring plans.
Following the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence against demos of police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, on Saturday, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as well as about 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a big bid.
According to the task forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security blockade.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing guns.
According to the rankings, there were also among the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there have been six arrests.
Better Salaries and Appreciation of Colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had carried out almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked Manel Perez, a 55-year-old Catalan protester.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they strangled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security flaw in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the panic was announced a day before the Tory party day in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the Wettbergen exit in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia this evening," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised the record-breaking victory against SSC Napoli after the 3:1 (1:1) victory.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early remnants by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung up the worst pursuer first.
The goaltender picked up by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
Ronaldo also made a head-to-head corner for the match against defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push just before the goal line.
“There are a lot of templates,” the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the striker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalscorer.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ dominance seems to be even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
The table spread, which was coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already-warned Mario Rui (58th), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch after too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
“We played well against a good Napoli,” commented the Turin coach.
Emre can feel the same way.
The German national player has settled at Juve.
The pro, who came from FC Liverpool, was in charge of all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turins and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West is changing his name.
With a particularly succinct performance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for head snorkels and question marks in the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
You can just call him "Ye", the musician said.
“The creature that used to be known as Kanye West,” he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 M<0xC3><0xBC>nster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage did not shy away from his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more hands-on, we put him as well as never before problems." Similarly, the list of Hoetmar shooting opportunities reads thinly.
Grade two chances in 90 minutes, so that you can only rarely make positive games.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG also had only two options in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he was free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz H<0xC3><0xB6>ne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed at first and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all surrendered.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the tor line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stoked the ball over the line was the game decided (81st).
“We had previously criticized ourselves hard, which was different today than in the last few weeks,” concluded Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Towers: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 M<0xC3><0xBC>nster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about it,” he said.
"We don't even have access to those," he allegedly meant the winging vocals with Colby McGill and Janis Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ger, but probably all the other green-whites who appear with collective offensive urge.
Still, he was able to laugh: “A bloody victory,” he said, quivering and pulling from there. His players, however, were relieved to note that they had pulled three points out of the affair.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“That was by far our best season performance,” he says.
"As we come back after 0:2, as we have been holding up against one of the top teams in the league over the entire game, that was already really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it seems that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
On the left side, he scored 2-0 for Fabian Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hning (39th).
We knew that, but a player like that can’t get out completely.
"It was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski admitted the quality of the opponent without hesitation.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to make up for it: McGill’s free kick from the left sailed between H<0xC3><0xB6>velmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long track (45th).
After the page change, it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a fun, action-packed game.
N<0xC3><0xBC>bel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the excess, Albersloh failed to score the last Concordia match (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
“The game against chess is what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohb<0xC3><0xBC>cker, Adolph, Zur M<0xC3><0xBC>hlen - Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - H<0xC3><0xB6>velmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 N<0xC3><0xBC>bel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 J<0xC3><0xBC>lkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg beats Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg and FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually gone for three points, but coach Oliver Pfaff’s team was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: The entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire presidency of football second-legist Dynamo Dresden has declined, according to media reports.
Several media outlets called in the evening for a joint letter from the Saxons.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga member.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Germany: Politics instead of Pump

Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to personally collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, director of the Academy, proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That the Academy in the Tutzing Castle always appeared prominent, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, composer Konstantin Waker attends a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is attending a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in person in Tutzing, which is also received in another category by television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
“Retirement is not safe!” says a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war abhors any human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday is coming soon, the more visitors to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather expect a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What does neutrality look like?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerdel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westf<0xC3><0xA4>lische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret actress, Teubner envisioned gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben was sitting on the wing.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to terms with the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: so congenially accompanied by Suvekr<0xC3><0xA4>p Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, in the way it fit into the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have been the result of Mozart’s composing if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Suvekr<0xC3><0xBC>p glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
However, the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, the police corrected the victim numbers slightly downwards.
There were 10 passengers, instead of 15, who were slightly injured.
All of them have since been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released during the day, a police spokesman said.
Still unclear is the cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was unbraked in front of a dashboard.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG retains almost the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleneins had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored only ten hits.
"Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn’t get them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
Concentration in the end made his team miss this time.
As a result, the ASG ran almost to the end of a downturn, was behind the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45th).
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hosts became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extreme clever the decisive door" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschk<0xC3><0xB6>tter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball girls of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue Whites won the VC Allbau Essen second-leg downhill with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
That’s what we’ve been working on,” said coach Dominik M<0xC3><0xBC>nch after a nearly flawless performance by his team at the crashed table leader.
The first pass dominated the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Food has been accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We did a good job of it.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eating has converted the acceptance to three-barrel.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food has dried up, and we’ve let ourselves in a bit,” M<0xC3><0xBC>nch continued.
At 18:17 the volleyball girls from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
At 19:24, Ostbevern defended four more bats, but the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a better class," the practice leader found to the rising level.
Maike R<0xC3><0xBC>dingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch: "We played there consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-Whites brought pass four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, R<0xC3><0xBC>dingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the grand Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind in the German-Turkish relationship a pile of scarves that can only be painstakingly turned together,” said G<0xC3><0xB6>kay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a joint, conciliatory appearance.
“Instead of side-by-side with German top politicians emphasizing Muslims’ affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for its purposes,” Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already been established
After the long summer break is finally folk meeting time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Home Association of Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folk Meeting in the Kamin room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day then it is a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our people’s meeting would continue so quickly in emergency situations.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
“The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk songs, wandering and seamen songs, folk songs, evergreens and old beaters,” says Karl-Heinz Steverm<0xC3><0xBC>er, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion have pledged to make the first folk-meeting "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk meet remember the last event of the summer when Christoph Schulz of the folk meet Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Fr<0xC3><0xB6>sche in der Nacht" enchanted the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
“We expect many happy guests to once again spend a pleasant and humorous evening,” the home association’s invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get involved actively is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always fast-paced, it is recommended to be there on time.
The meeting starts at 7.30 pm, but the entrance is already at 7.30 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
With this, the approvals in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the United States are still in place for the billion-dollar merger.
Recently, the chances of approval had improved, according to an insider, because Linde has promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruiting to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Association for Gardening and Land Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the association for gardening and landscaping Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At the time, he was known as the "Kulmbach City and Country District Building Association" and was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today’s work – it was actually purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening no one thought at the time.
“At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite of the elites,” said G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Dippold, a district nurse.
Fruit trees should be planted on long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the mediation of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Moulw<0xC3><0xBC>rfe" showed how diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are.
“Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age,” said the district chairman G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co. similarly.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter S<0xC3><0xB6>llner for the anniversary.
“Where they are to stand, the circuit association decides,” added Landrat S<0xC3><0xB6>llner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, there was no doubt about it also the district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the Circle Association and related, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was watered down.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
“Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it,” pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for horticultural associations not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens into our associations, added the president of the Bavarian Landsverband, Wolfram Vaitl.
“We have to stop the elated decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren,” concluded G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Reif, the successful festival that was celebrated by the Thurnau Music Association’s towers.

Priority on oil talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity in terms of oil: they make the two trading partners an ultimatum to an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the Minister will only speak on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, it focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico had agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from oil in the future.
The talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be finalized, the Trump administration wants to present the deal to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to R<0xC3><0xAD>o de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it remains unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on an open road during an election campaign event in southern Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xB6>" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Even in the social networks, the associations made racist and women-warranting statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with an announcement by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As a former mayor of the million-dollar city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro.
While the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently been presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this one successfully - no matter who he faces.
Bolsonaro is known for his anti-gay and anti-black rhetoric and for praising the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal deviations.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.
Europe regains Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup march in front of the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer J<0xC3><0xB6>rn Jeppesen told Larsen’s website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music figures such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars L<0xC3><0xB6>kke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boys" who "were against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchist opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert night with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerzentrum a behfreunde a.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians still take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Achlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loud and clear delight the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feather and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and pressured interplay.
Although "Add" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage for the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same as hardrock demonstrates guitar player Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai H<0xC3><0xB6>lscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent sounds of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the dreamy, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impress with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-weary rock riffs of multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from T<0xC3><0xB6>nnish<0xC3><0xA4>uschen has played a special degree of fame since its inception in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a 2017 film by Max Meis about the tour in China - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann, meanwhile, delivers a resounding solo, running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of this kind of hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the team at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition", is about 98 Dezibel.
This is at the press air hammer level, but this is still clearly under the controls of the "Wacken Festival Valley", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual for the annual metal distillery in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener does not need the audience on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rock band have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we took the bone saws and lit a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in plane crash at Essen/M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim airport
There was a fatal accident at M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen airport.
A sailplane crashed in a parking lot at M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the West German Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a sailing aircraft crashed on the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed there.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a one-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already in a landing.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
However, an Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr regions and directly on the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump calls Kim, “And then we fell in love”
The fact that North Korea’s President-in-Office, Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is perfectly safe is no secret.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “wonderful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made North Korean leader Kim Jong Un an unusual declaration of love on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old outbreak of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although the nuclear disarmament around North Korea proved to be quite tougher.
“I was heartbroken, so was he, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And it’s not just the conversations with Kim that would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip-knowledge behind them so far.
That the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - for his martial-threats - should not be more familiar to everyone, seemed to be quite conscious of the President of the United States.
In any case, he immediately took the criticism to be expected when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they’ve fallen in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidial.
But he cares very little about it, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there would not be 10,000 people outside pushing into this sprawling arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is best visited, moody as well as utterly spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler’s downtown has cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the main tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out with the help of a mobile video to their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had turned the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself at risk for life.
One of his accomplices had been beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a help call by phone video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human dignity.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the folk school site on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lesson for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then via the roof terrace and from there via a ladder into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police that the investigation had taken place.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please refer to the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, phone number 059 133 4244.
Germans were trapped in their own car for days.
A 75-year-old man in a wooded area in central Franconia has had to endure several days and nights in his car after he had stuck the car away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a trip with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search measures, the man’s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
K<0xC3><0xB6>ln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements about the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns above all the wave of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
According to his own statements, Laschet also spoke about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense’s air readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact – and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the U.S.: North Korea asks for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not getting tired of stressing the successes in the denuclearization negotiations in North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a meeting of Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest standstill is because the United States is building on coercive measures that are deadly for building trust,” Ri said in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
That North Korea’s sanctions could force on the “knees” is “a dream room for people who don’t know us”.
To build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri said.
However, there have been no “responsive responses” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to strictly abide by the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump met North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: white ceilings and floral jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
Starting with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators packed with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food had deteriorated and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start again: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone,” Westbuer said.
And so they all packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
“It’s better not to have chefs,” one visitor said, as Hokkaido curry soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Reverend Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lamben with card tricks and other pieces of art provided surprises.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Sator leaves the National Board of Governors of NRW at the table
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Sartor, resigned his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
I liked too many of them in my back.
The head of the National Association of Tables, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding to the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor with him.
"I can trace his step - there have been people who didn't even know exactly why the Essen Table is doing it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, because nothing changes about it," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards.
One should not follow the approach, “without us, the people in the city will starve.”
It is the state’s job to ensure that people are not starving.
The Essener did not take part in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
“I’m told too much sweetness,” he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me that way at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after relegation - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 in the home game against TV Neuler, Lorch was already in the lead - at the end of the 2:3 standings and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
Very different from TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly came in with 0:1, but after 90 minutes, won with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB could at the same time with a 3:0
Gladbach plays double lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach still has to wait for an external victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has been away four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco’s team once again put that strength to the day with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka per head, as a result of which the hosts preserved the mini-padded with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is welcoming from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre’s team had dealt a 0:2 rebound against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half came to a 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalled with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Bremen were decimated before the break, the Stuttgarters had to be afraid in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Targeter manufactured a curious draft owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to make up for it.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful but also a failed debut for Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach.
Joining the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, Gladbacher gave a two-time lead, finally playing 2:2 and still waiting for an outside victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's 1:1 draw, Renato Steffen was in charge of his second Bundesliga.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-meter flat shot of the Aargauer, as well as in the second counter-attack after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite alarming.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record-buying team from OGC Nice met for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in a mandatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished fourth.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first match of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serbian was cashing in after a jersey match against Daniel Rovida.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game by a curious draft owner (68), a quarter-hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the oversized Stuttgarter back on Victory Street.
N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg decided the duel against D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf 3:0 sovereign for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens started the home team with foul penalty.
Macedonian voters vote on new names of state
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens agree on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
In the event of a Yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had persisted in a name change due to its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
A refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum-seeker had randalized in Alsergrund at around 10 p.m. on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who walked on passers-by with balled fists and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
After that, the Syrians tried to beat the officials and step in.
Shortly thereafter, it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground at a tram stop on W<0xC3><0xA4>hringer Strasse.
In addition, he had stepped the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffer from hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown reason", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two made their debut in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a domestic political speaker of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused outrage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "crouched" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Fr<0xC3><0xBC>ndnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schr<0xC3><0xB6>er, chairman of the Citizens’ Association.
And it has accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedges have been cut once.
The breakfast that is always after work also has a long tradition.

World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and it has fit everything today,” said the third Olympia of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away with joy and stretched both arms to the heights of victory – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had the starting number four.
However, the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The fact that it remained on K<0xC3><0xB6>nigswieser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e during the attempt at the single-family house is due to the alarm system.
It was released when the perpetrators laid their hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them in such a way that they escaped without looting.

Battle of Hertha: From reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim phase for Niko Kovac’s term in office.
The first small performance delle under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to increase to a greater autumn depth for the Munichers.
“A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a bit of a reality,” said Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that really annoys us and that’s why we give gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal has been scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the leaderboard in the football league lost first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record holder must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitching on the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the most powerful Bayern have yet to crack.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like it and we will do everything we can to make it successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, he moved with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and moved his first defeat as Munich coach only to the once again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach on Saturday would still have the first intermediate phase of his term in office positive – otherwise the tone would probably have intensified.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures at Benfica Lisbon before the second King class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparations for the second pre-round game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens to start sovereign with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," said national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Just like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The lawyer acted in the role of a warner.
“I don’t think that’s all bad, we have to work it out again because we don’t make the many chances and make the mistakes behind it,” the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with an eye wink, rated it at least positively, that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil cause: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan is pushing for the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan in Germany.
While DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the line.
Now a new post will be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil theme.
After the Turkish President sharply criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the line.
Early Sunday morning, <0xC3><0x96>zil personally attacked the Grindel in the Mainz ZDF- "Sportstudio" announced the consequences of the cause.
“In the future, because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-Teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not happen again,” said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had advocated racism towards <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan.
Our Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to take pictures with me in England," Erdogan said in the capital on Saturday.
To be honest, as her president, I couldn’t digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan’s statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB.”
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
"I'm very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed.
“If there is a clear impact on society and football without any migration background and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration has to work,” Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for office again next year as DFB president.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make it as good as it gets,” Grindel said.
Senior builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/R<0xC3><0xB6>dental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the speaker height area.
She told the pensioner that she was driving against her car.
However, there was no staff exchange, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, police received a phone call from a driver who had come off the road and had been driving against a checkpoint.
Speaking of which, the man did not want the police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the red-tailed man went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has undergone proceedings and a construction vehicle has been damaged when turning over.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car sustained significant damage in the accident.
The 75-year-old made a false impression and could no longer escape much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorfire in Meppen: still almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorfire at a Federal Wehrl<0xC3><0xA4>ger site in Emsland, 980 personnel are still engaged in the demolition work.
This was shared by the Federal Armed Forces on Sunday.
As the situation has continued to develop steadily, according to one speaker, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of deployments is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which had been called off well a week earlier on September 21 because it had been feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent by wind and lightning.
On Thursday, it was said that there was no longer a threat of a fire attack on neighboring communities.
Occasionally, more than 1,500 personnel tried to get the fire under control on site.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Armed Forces site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5th October, according to the Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke sign of the Moorbrand was temporarily drawn up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
Both have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two made their debut in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
When we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a domestic political speaker of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused outrage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "crouched" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any rapprochement from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the kick-off for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the afterlife.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor certificate, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
“They then have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very stressful,” he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita V<0xC3><0xB6>lker-Albert says.
“A register in which people can register their wishes – pro or contra organ donation – does not exist,” she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or her relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcount
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old student from Japan, is a world champion.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg, he faced 39 opponents.
This was shared by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants entered against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how to keep a ball in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greeting was already two years ago when the 14-year-old was in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super-brain, genius or miracle child, organisers can start laue little.
"Coaching can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computer competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root pulling of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at the advantage, because there, in the early childhood, headcounts are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands hide their most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were then detected in Serena’s lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish Blue Coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "Symbol Law" for consideration.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups that are covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern it is expected to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
On higher pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler H<0xC3><0xB6>he, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Gro<0xC3><0x9F>glockner Hochalpenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e) the road conditions become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start annual groceries on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers will be allowed to start annual knickknack care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the wooded federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
As corridors, Knicks connect scattered living spaces, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their workshops.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: through "turning" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a rich, oil-rich, diverse landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1,800 different species could live in one kilometre of knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he succumbs to a light tree line, which, in addition to species diversity, also reduces the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knickknack care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that auxiliary goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on the surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and even the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely downgraded, the national government is helping out.
Also a prison has been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free to run around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island going?
At the moment we have mobile reception, but before that it did not work and we have received information only via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don’t know if they are living and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquake, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not affected by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
VfB must refrain from Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo pulled a muscle fiber crack in the back left thigh in the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player said on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely no option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the next national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast at the time of failure.
A muscle bundler rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - The San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that could draw a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat came into use.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olching fell on a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stopped in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and fire department.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the task force again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to land, where after almost an hour it was put in a transport box by a firefighter with a hardened grip.
The injured duck was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschlei<0xC3><0x9F>heim.
But according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard mirrored the World Cup medal
At Olympia, Biathlete Julian Eberhard was long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener will pick up the missing precious metal at the World Championships in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang’s Olympia sprint to grab the medal.
Seven tenths of a second was finally missing on bronze.
“I consciously took the time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer, to recover the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the Constitution to a grand event, to win something.
At some point, you have to hit.
The WM-Loipe in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is located Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart", he remembers with joy at his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winner in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season, he ran in Oslo (NOR) to rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation into Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is greatly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the slim majority for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial over allegations of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The latest twist in the drama about Kavanaugh’s call for a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer threw angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the conservative U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed confident when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, despite his initial announcement, declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the grave reservations on Thursday as a "debate", initially contained further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared up, he said.
Trump later attacked the Democrats sharply at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They’re trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
The mobile radar unit of the municipality of Ried, which is installed in a "civil vehicle", is stationed on the Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, according to the municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I’ve seen every ball in there.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area,” Schalke 04’s sports manager said, breathing up.
After all, the Royal Blues had still managed to bring that close to 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from the press"., with increasing playing time, obviously more and more of the head played a role.
Don't really create a headball monster
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me,” said Heidelberg, “if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
“We’ve all fallen a huge stone from the heart,” said Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf, who didn’t have an insignificant share of it with his headball hitter: “I’m actually the worst headball player in the team.”
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start at the initial stage and make a firework out of it,” Schalke’s chief coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach matches over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: King's Blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a win," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out the police and fire department: An unknown man had set on a two-square-foot area on Gschwendner Berg M<0xC3><0xBC>ll.
According to the police, it looked as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy with pulling apart and destroying.
The police are now investigating the fire foundation.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He is repeatedly followed by the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years,” explains the founder and chairman of the “Reckenfelder Treff” – the association that cooperates with the “cultural policy” alliance during the evening’s orientation.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-speaking author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at a table, the first generation of migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
It is not decisive, therefore, whether one ranks politically to the right or to the left, but rather: “Am I for or against an open society?” he emphasizes.
At first, more and more behavior, then the discussion round starts.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani presents, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate rooms.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because “only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the next signing hour he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialties, he has been intensively discussed further.

This is how Schalkes Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-long Brazilian had spoken so correctly about the frust of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco at all his pros, the 36-year-old, who all simply called Naldo, turned in and said, "We've got to do it!"
“It was very emotional, it was a great sport,” Tedesco later said of the reaction to his vice-captain, who, despite his new reservist existence, did not hesitate.
Probably Naldo, who was hailed as the best striker last season, knows that he has actually not gotten on the bench with his coach – but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn’t easy to tell him that.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’m telling you quite honestly,” Tedesco said of the moment when he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the starting lineup.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco said.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that at this time everyone can sniff through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also caught Naldo last time.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downturn compared to the Eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) stood at 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Austria, however, has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone’s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, yet the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Ireland’s only industry cracked this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened downturn could mean that the worst is over,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains at least the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the Eurozone fell as strongly as since November 2011.
As a result, the companies were building up jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
Even in China, industrial production declined more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are raised.
