MG Baltic case: Gustaini’s new lawyer says he has not yet been able to get to know the case material
At Monday’s 11th MG Baltic trial, all the defendants met: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the statements of the accused.
At the last court meeting, the state appointed new lawyer S. Gustaini told the College of Judges Alexander Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev that he had not yet been able to get acquainted with the material of the case.
At the time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said that in order to ensure the full protection of the individual, the College of Judges must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the material of the case and asked for a court hearing.
“In order to ensure a person’s defense, he must familiarize himself with the subject matter of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal sitting," Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev noted that he had not been able to get acquainted either with the indictment or with the whole material of the case.
Before that, the suspect, S. Gustaini, at a former court hearing, announced the resignation of his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The lawyers of the defendants were angry that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The lawmaker suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated favorable decisions for the company in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision-making of public procurement winners, reminds ELTA.
More than 150 people, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament, were interviewed during the investigation.
More than 200 surveys were conducted and more than 30 times.
S. Gustaini is suspected to have received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000, G. Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, V. Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than 27,000. E. Masiuli is suspected to have taken more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106,000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trafficking in influence, the Liberal Party is suspected of bribery, trafficking in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trafficking in influence of these parties.
It is suspected that politicians on bribes met with MG Baltic vice-president R. Kurlianski, and later the Seimas or other institutions proposed or supported initiatives favorable to the group.
Ethical Guardians: The Liberal Conjugation Board on the Rights of the Vilnius Chapter
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes", - after the meeting of the BNS, its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas reported.
“This decision was not something new.
We had already made the explanation as a Commission in July, when the issue of Pag<0xC4><0x97>gi<0xC5><0xB3> and Utena was raised.
Then we said that according to the statutes it is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that a section can act as it wishes - go with the committee and the board agrees to it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted and then it would be a decision that all parties are parties to it.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tama<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>n, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Conjugation Board of the Party abolished the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the party, but with the new list of the electoral committee being held.
According to the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, the board's decisions.
Until 31 October, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel its efforts to participate in municipal elections with a list of committees.
But the department didn’t do that.
The former head of the division, MP Au<0xC5><0xA1>nin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already left the Liberals’ constituency.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberals’ Association Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, promising to seek another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee “Beyond Vilnius, which we are proud of!”
He also left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and mayors will be held next year’s fight.
Residents of a village in northern India were driving a tiger on a tractor, which had previously hit a man, officials said on Monday.
Forest guard officer Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahaviras Kaud<0xC5><0xBE>lagis) said that on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, as they tried to escape, seized it with a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and bitten a young man about 10 days ago.
The smallest village is located in Dudhwa Tiger District in Lakhympur Kheri District, about 250 km southeast of the capital of Utar Pradesh.
Stealing tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, director of security, said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasano area of Utar Pradesh hit another tiger, which suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is a national animal of India; tigers are considered to be extinct under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
Last year’s government data showed that at least one person was killed every day during the previous three years in clashes with wild tigers or dragons.
People’s conflicts with tigers have been increasing gradually since the 8th decade, when India launched a tiger protection program that established associations in national parks, and the slaughter of large cats began to be considered a crime.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the findings show that the population of about 1,800 tigers at the time has increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Suggested cats and dogs must be marked with microschemes
The Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose that cats and dogs must be marked with sub-micro-schemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with sub-microchips and that they should be registered and marked by local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so the population will not worry and the costs will be covered by special state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee at Seimas.
Amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
Preliminary estimates are that, according to the likely average price for the micro-scheme and the provision of services, which will reach around EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated over the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million annually.
It is expected that funding for labelling programmes will be allocated through a special programme to support the environmental protection of municipalities, which this year's revenue will increase significantly as a result of increased natural resource taxes and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Majeikos, the practice of mandatory labelling has spread to almost all countries of the European Union, this allows the protection of the animals themselves (because it is easy to return to the owners if they have lost their way), and saves the time of the breeders themselves when they have fled and fell into a trap.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, marking obliges the animal to take responsibility for its entire life.
The previous proposals had to be marked with resistance, as the programmes in question were proposed to be financed by the population.
"The model presented now should avoid these criticisms, because animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the Environmental Protection Support Programme and to give the right to mark not only veterinary doctors, but also to the public, i.e. to the authors of the project with the specialized staff of the animal welfare institution
The bill was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different Seimas groups - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
In eastern Afghanistan, 13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack
The provincial governor's spokesman, Arifas Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers had died.
He added that during a joint army and police checkpoint in the Chogyan district, another four soldiers were wounded.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces, and ten more were wounded by the Taliban.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahideen issued a statement in which the movement took responsibility for Monday's attack in the province of Gaza.
Noori said that this post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area in order to separate the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Rytas" straight-handed assistance to Ukrainian club
The FIBA European Cup’s fourth tournament will take place on Wednesday in the arena of Vilnius Ryto, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
Dvikova will be held in the capital for political reasons.
The Cherkasy Mavpy and Pri<0xC5><0xA1>tina KB Prishtina teams will host the Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Pri<0xC5><0xA1>tina "KB Prishtina" on November 7 after their roof in the Ryto arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," coach of the Ukrainian team Maxima Michelson thanked Rytui.
“We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the Vikings.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine, as these countries have no diplomatic relations.
At the moment, the Ukrainian team takes third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more wins.
This will be a very important finding for Group E, as only two teams will reach the next stage.
In the past, there was also a selection of Ukraine and Kosovo in the 2017 European Basketball Championship in Vilnius.
Then 100:61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to get into the game on Wednesday for free, and the start of the match is 19 hours.
"Women Lie Better" Star Actress B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> Persecuted by Lies
It’s probably just a meeting, but the wonderful brunette actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has already received several roles related to lying.
Initially, the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Beliefs" and finally the comedy "Beliefs".
In this film, Brigitte plays the ambitious wife of the hero Daniaus Kazlauska.
"I really enjoyed filming in Melaga, because I'm more of a theater actress and I've rarely appeared in cinemas.
A wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the very beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never liked those little, decorative "fifigs" quads.
But during the filming, Sunny so attached to me that the sympathies became mutual and I finally even set out to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully,” she said.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai", produced by Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys", has been entering the peripheries of the family members from the very first minutes.
Your loved one just told you she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without expecting to announce the "good news" to everyone, the parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And it all happens before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such an atomization.
Not all heroes are what they looked like at first sight.
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>’s comedy, “Melagai” will give a good mood to the viewers four-time movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Liubomir Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gidiminas.
Comedy "Melagai" - in cinemas since November 9th.
Decide whether to write down 100 million euros in unpaid taxes on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas agreed to consider the amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence by Ramun Karbauskis, the leader of the "citizens".
56 members of the Seimas voted against 9, and 25 abstained.
Further, the Seimas will take the consideration of amendments on or after December 6, after receiving the Government's conclusions.
According to Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared leaving Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "promote non-compliance" with the people - declare departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as they teach.
The amendments provide that those who leave Lithuania will be considered as persons who will pay social insurance contributions to the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will be exempt from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of Sodros Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius has previously said that such a move will facilitate the lives of people emigrating and the activities of Sodros.
A video posted on the Internet about a glimmering bush reveals a serious problem
It was filmed as a mother-in-law stuck in a narrow snowy mud, and the little boy was still limping, slumped down and again a persistent copy.
The video has received a lot of reviews and comments.
People were amazed by the persistence of the little bower - repeatedly slid down, he snorted again to his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but the little boy does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is really worth the attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm sure the drone was very scared.
From their movements they can see that they are panicking.
If a drone did not fly around, they would most likely have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," environmentalist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues were investigating how drones were acting on bows.
The animals were fitted with heart rate gauges.
When the drone approached, one of them left running, the other ran nowhere, but the hearts of all of them began to cry more often from fear.
Scientists recommend that drones be used to film animals responsibly, do not fall too close, do not make noise and do not stray where it is prohibited.
The president has been contacted by the newspaper.
The Kiev court on Tuesday called on the deposed President Viktor Yanukovych to come to the case for his suspected treasonous state in an unusual way, the call was announced in the state's official publication.
In the call of the court, published in the government’s news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend the November 19th session of the criminal trial, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the end of the debate in Yanukovych’s case.
Alexander Goro<0xC5><0xA1>inski, a lawyer who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers by November 19 so that he could participate in a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to be in touch with the image as his last.
The Kremlin’s support for Yanukovych was defeated and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, triggered by the president’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine had been taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and later a war broke out in the east between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the battle has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure long-term ceasefires.
List of Conservatives in Vilnius City Council by Valdas Benkunskas
The former Minister of Economy, MP Dainius Kreivys, was confirmed as a Conservative candidate for the year earlier.
On the weekend during the Conservative primary elections, party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
As reported by the party, the leader of the list of conservatives became V. Benkunskas, president of the TS-LKD Vilnius chapter association.
In the first ten candidates were Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adamas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaustys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former Seimas member Liutauras Kazlavickas, and the Young Conservatives of Vali<0xC5><0xA1>inas.
The direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 of next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Powers Complaints to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as it promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas Opposition Group of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that a group of Seimas members appealed to the KT to investigate compliance with the provisions of the Waste Management Act adopted by the rulers.
"Parliamentarians underscore that the provisions of the law aim to quash the projects of waste incineration plants that are already under way, by instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas.
"Parliamentarians note that, in the absence of a prohibition on the construction of objects of state importance (i.e. a defined distance and a definition of the concept of 'residential territory'), the conclusion that the prohibition does not constitute a prohibition is that the prohibition
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The ICC has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that have arisen before the new act has entered into force.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back in accordance with an undefined criterion.
Having established such a legal regulation to violate the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of the cogeneration plants of Vilnius and Kaunas.
With the ongoing projects halted, the state would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses, and the population of Lithuania - the price of heating would increase, due to the increasing amount of environmental pollution in landfills of waste disposal.
The application was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberals’ Association, the Social Democrats’ factions and senior vice-chairman of the ruling Social Democrats’ working group, Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to dismiss President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>’s veto on the provisions of the Waste Management Act, which provided for the government’s right to stop the already-initiated “cogenerational power plants”.
Amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on January 1, 2019. True, the rulers are already proposing to waive the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed further at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to stop projects that have already begun is not planned.
KT will examine this case in order - not earlier than a year later.
LeBron James's statistics at the Lakers club have been published
LeBron James's early career at the Los Angeles Lakers club is not what he expected, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers began the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped to emerge in the minds of potential coach Luke Walton's dismissal.
Still, the language was calmed down by basketball operations president Magic Johnson, who said that the coach will not give up, but it is better to play.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should turn to himself.
While the striker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 rebounds.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures emerged, showing that the Lakers are playing better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
+/- statistics showing how many points more bet or pass by the team when there are certain players in the field.
That’s when L. James is on the pitch, the Lakers have lost 30 points more than their rivals this season.
When he sat on the floor, the Lakers earned 19 points more than the opponents.
Currently, the Lakers are only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuania’s airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions five times in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the destroyers of Spain's Eurofighter were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai in the months of May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that there is regular consultations between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since the opening of its embassy in Vilnius in 2004, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga has been the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga handed over the allocation letters to President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a: I believe in a man's innocence and legal maturity
“It was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, it is likely that the services are carrying out the work that must be carried out.
We each do our job.
I believe in the rule of law, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no unfair actions of his should be taken," A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> said.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a Special Investigations Service (STT) arrested on Monday - the lawmaker suspects that he, while still the director of the administration of the Municipality of Raseini, took a high-value bribe, and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that had signed with the government.
Representatives of private companies are suspected to have bought Aca directly or to have participated in the masking of bribes through various financial transactions.
In April of this year, R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a, the municipal council of Raseinii district, was relieved of the duties of the head of the administration after the third test.
The former "manager" in March of this year became a member of the newly formed Gedimino Kirkilos-led Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party, he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
A few years ago, he ran unsuccessfully in the election as a representative of the election committee Your Races.
A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> says the man did not intend to run for office in next year’s Raseinii board elections, but had not yet decided whether to participate in municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with a list of Lithuanian citizens and green unions, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says he is dismissing further law enforcement actions - it will depend on whether it will be removed from the work commission.
"I'm really not making the right decisions today, this week, I think I'll decide.
I will see, if there is a need, what the charges are, I will, of course, make one or the other decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - it will all put time in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives, Seime Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97>, called on the President of the Seimas, Viktor Pranckiet<0xC4><0x97>, and Ram<0xC5><0xAB>na Karbausk<0xC4><0x97>, the head of the "states", to distance himself from the statements of the group's colleague Vidas A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>, and to withdraw her from the committee of the Seimis.
She said that A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>’s further work at the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would “cause public based distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight committee.”
Sensual "Coldplay" music is mind-blowing and famous Lithuanian couple
On Monday evening, a lot of music and film lovers will market for the upcoming premiere of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of well-known people: Jonah and Simona Nainia, Ignas Lelys, Martyns Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular ass bands, Coldplay, which intersects with moments from concerts.
The documentary director Matas Whitecross met the men of the group when they were still playing in bars and gathered only a few dozen spectators.
You can watch the film from behind the scenes, from rehearsals or from your spare time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
They were joined shortly after by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first album, Safety, which contained three works.
The majority of the 500 copies were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were sold.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums that have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy Awards.
"Juventus" to victory married V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis - LKL week MVP
Having played solid matches at Betsafe-LKL, Utenas Juventus’ top scorer, Vaidas <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis, won the title of the most useful player of the week.

Israelis shot dead in West Bank after Palestinian man stabbed to death
The war “has paved the way for this attack because it has identified a terrorist trying to strike civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier with a knife,” according to a report released by the Israeli military on the incident at Kiryat Arbo’s headquarters near Hebron.
“The military launched a fire on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF troops have not been harmed," the statement added.
A military spokesman for the AFP news agency said the attack was being carried out by a Palestinian.
After the incident, the footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in the year 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but it is feared that a new wave of them may arise.
On 22 October, a Palestinian was shot dead by a knife-wielding group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries, facilitating the conditions for foreign imports.
During the opening of the trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unify efforts to curb the spread of protectionism in the world" in the face of a rise in commodity prices.
"The European Union is a very important commitment by China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
The opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments should be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict adherence to international agreements - this must be an essential part of the new investment relationship environment," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed.
"Corrupted flows of capital should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import show is trying to mitigate criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several countries, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently ranked 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50%, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investment in Lithuania could have an adverse political impact, and Beijing’s focus on Eastern Europe is undermining EU unity.
Disadvantages to solve: mobile signature service is already working
The mobile signature provider of Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions reports that the failure of the mobile signature system has been removed and the service is functioning as usual.
The mobile signature began to operate again at 2.28 p.m.
The mobile signature system crashed on Monday at 9.52 a.m.
These failures were experienced by customers of telecommunications companies Bit<0xC4><0x97>s, Tele2 and Telia.
The cause of the SK ID Solutions malfunction has been identified, but it is not disclosed for security reasons.
The company apologizes to consumers for the inconvenience.
SK ID Solutions specializes in the field of international e-identification solutions.
These are the partners of the Estonian State which issue certificates of national identity documents and give citizens of different countries the opportunity to access electronic services and to submit electronic signatures.

SK ID Solutions services are used by more than two million end-users in the Baltics.
The reason for the crash of the Lion Air plane revealed: the death toll
The data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air show that during at least the last four flights, a malfunction of the speedometer was detected, the researchers said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) Soerjanto Tjahjono said a similar crash occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one when the singer crashed into the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media outlets have reported concerns over the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed of the air, that is, the speed of the plane," Tjahyon said during a press conference.
"The data from the black box showed that two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight were also the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of goodies on social media.
We now want to clarify that in the black box (the data went out) about four flights, during which there were problems due to the speed of the air meter," the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with family members of the deceased, Tjahyon said that the information of the device recording flight data corresponded to reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed dramatically after the aircraft had gone up.
The search teams have not yet found a second black box recording the conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it had fixed the technical malfunction during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to attend a meeting of contact minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, a moderated family member meeting with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and an investigation into the disaster.
However, he stood up and shook his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnanu, be introduced to Lion Air, founded in 1999.
Lion Air acted improperly, said one man, posing as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadan, a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
“Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any feelings.”
After this meeting, Kiran hurriedly left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts were handed over to nearly 140 body bags loaded with human remains.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives raised the question as to why two months ago the pilot was allowed to fly, although during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, a malfunction appeared, among other things, causing passengers to be terrified by the sudden plane crash immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said the breach had been removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not say that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians must answer according to the law, so that the aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahyon said that a large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread in a fairly small area indicate that the liner was likely to hit the water by flying at a very high speed.
"The plane was the only one when it crashed into the sea.
It didn’t blow up in the air, and the aircraft’s engines, when it touched the water, acted in large circles – it shows all the broken turbine blades,” the official said.
The sinking of Lion Air is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when the company Garuda crashed near Medano, killing 234 people.
After the accident, the rescuers were led by: the victim and the minor
On Monday evening on the road V<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x87>i - Plung<0xC4><0x97>, the cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided in Tilvika.
The car was hit by a cactus and three people were reported to have been injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road and hitchhiked to the Mercedes-Benz car, which was carried out by his father, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The driver of BMW was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
The girls from Mercedes-Benz had their teeth wiped out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
PRESIDENT: There is no need for any artificial simplifications on the referendum
After the Seimas approved a proposal by the rulers to reduce the referendum bloc to the currently protected first section of the Constitution, the president will amend the veto, her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97> says.
“More than half of the population voted for the Constitution – that’s a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It is not difficult to predict that the president would really be vetoed," Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s domestic policy adviser told the news radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the basic elements of the state defined in the first section of the Constitution - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so that, if these articles were to be changed, the necessary number of votes would be changed, according to Ling<0xC4><0x97>s, the precedent would not be "made" and the precedent would not be "made"
"In the president's view, there is no need for any artificial simplifications, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with higher protections shall be adopted if, during the referendum, at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote so agree.
Currently, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may be replaced by a referendum in the first and fourteenth articles of the Constitution.
The right to vote in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved a presidential veto in September on amendments that had previously been adopted in Parliament, softening the demands for the number of votes to change Article 12 of the First Section of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The cartel is proposed to be reduced in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, it should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants who immigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, currently, with some exceptions, may not have dual citizenship.
Dual citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but it is feared that under the current conditions the referendum would not take place - not enough people would vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be renewed
Lithuania’s airports and road infrastructure are starting to crumble, so it needs to be renewed, said Minister of Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already fragile, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to renew Vilnius airport - it doesn't even fit into the long-term planning, it's a minimum of what we have to do", - said Masiuli at a contact conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the "State" magazine on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the Via Baltica, the Rail Baltica, the Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da external airport, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of new airports.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of an external port in Klaipeda, the arrangement of airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Communications said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
“The state of the road is not improving so far, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We expect to build new roads, but even the most necessary maintenance, such as on the main roads, is lacking funds.
We need to determine how much should be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve,” said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport sector services grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, which surrounded Russia.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU country carriers will be required to periodically return wolves to the country of registration.
“We have to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for a permanent return home for tractors is absurd, because empty trucks burning fuel would be driving in Europe, increasing emissions.
Most of this is the happiness of railways, because the cost will increase so much that part of the transport will pass to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
General domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees, operates more than 7,500 companies.
Conflict with heredity
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that negotiations had begun to change the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis, Mr Masiulis’s deliberations, called the political pressure.
According to him, a building built in the sixth decade of the last century is a value, recorded in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that modern arrival terminals would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
"It would be a politically important step to extract that old terminal from the heritage, so that it can be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal can be built to make Vilnius feel like a modern country, rather than such an interesting, truly unrepresentative part of our country as an innovat," he said.
Mr Masiulis also said at the time that he planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and airport in Kaunas to connect with Rail Baltica in cancer, building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Last year, the airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to speak up about the disease
“We always have to be prepared for the worst of times.
What I want to be happy about is that for the first time in the history of Lithuania, for the third year in a row, we accumulate reserves.
But it is also a very important thing - not to speak of disease," Shapok told reporters in Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> are taking part in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how the revenue received for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft Italian budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural filmmaker, ethnographer and landscape artist Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D> (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>nai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai province.
Speaking of the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-giving national revival has called many Lithuanian people, including the brothers Bura<0xC4><0x8D>us - Bali, Jona, Bronis - from the depths of the village to the creative power to transform ourselves into a culture.
For more than 50 years, Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D> has travelled the native land with a camera in his hands, presenting a broad and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing bloodlines of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, the landscape of Lithuania, the hills, the everyday life and the festive environment, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a large part of the legacy of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, dedicated to the description of national working habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and difficult occupations.
The book contains very rich descriptions of the works of the inhabitants of <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija, especially of the middle-class, the north-eastern, the Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kis, as well as the works of the inhabitants of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitia and D<0xC5><0xAB>kija, their festivals and other traditions and customs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>.
Out of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs have been selected for this publication, which have been grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of the buds, the buds, and other areas of the Highlands and the Lowlands.

The tragic fate of the couple: died just a few hours after the marriage
In the southwestern state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds who had married just hours earlier died in a helicopter crash.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died Sunday shortly after midnight on a helicopter landing on a hill 16 km north-west of Juvalds and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steve said.
The strange thing is that the accident took place after about 24 kilometers, just as much as the year the youngsters were.
The 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
Youngsters studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the hands of the Bileri family near Juvalds, and after the wedding, a family-owned helicopter exploded.
The accident occurred after the helicopter crashed about 24 km away.
Youngsters are flying to Sant Antoni International Airport, where they were going to sit on the plane and fly a honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
“It’s a very shallow, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high,” Kennedy said.
Mr. D. Lawrence piloted the family's aircraft for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be revealed what the pilot’s physical condition was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the ascent.
His fractured limb was exposed to a wide beam on the slope of a cliff, and the hull remained "dangerously swollen", flight security researcher Craig Hatchas of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
The researchers plan to extract the debris and then take a deep look at them, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined and the preliminary NTSB report should be published within two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told his party's Likud MPs, his office said.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Trump, the United States imposes particularly strict sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran during all the time when efforts have begun to curb its aggression," the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would be a “decisive” blow to Israel’s actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the strictest sanctions of all time," began to apply after Trump's May decision to withdraw from the world powers deal with Tehran over its nuclear program, which is controversial.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran’s oil exports, which have already dropped about 1 million barrels per day since May, and separating Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long disagreed with the agreement with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also said the lifting of sanctions allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow it to be militarily established there.
Other participants in the deal with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the U.S. decision and say the deal has not yet allowed Iran to buy nuclear weapons.
The court again investigates the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
After the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern city, the court will listen to the witness’s testimony in the case after the accident.
The Vilnius District Court on Tuesday decided that in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be questioned at the next meeting on November 26.
A justifiable judgment has already been issued in this case, but the Prosecutor’s Office does not agree with it.
On 22 August, the Vilnius city district court acquitted the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduarda Osipova, of the fatal motorcycle accident, after announcing that the motorcycle driver was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious injury.
The Vilnius County Prosecutor’s Office requests the District Court to overturn the district court’s decision and claims that the accident is the biggest fault of Mr Osipov, and the district court’s findings are unfounded.
The lawyer of the family of the deceased motorcyclist is also requested to remedy the justifiable decision.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015 at about 3 p.m., when a car driven by E. Osipovo "<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia" from Lak<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0xB3> Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0xB3> Street and collided with a main road motorcycle.
Prosecutors charged the man that the driver of the car violated the rules of the road, intending to give way, and caused a traffic incident - a man who was driving a motorcycle "Piaggo" died on the main road.
The initial police reports indicated that the driver of the scooter had died, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was comparable to the motorcycle according to power.
Roland Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas BNS, a judge at the Vilnius city’s district court, said experts found that the motorcyclist was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at the site is 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would be driven at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of the honorable age car was confirmed to be driving at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, who saw the crash, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before confronting <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
Prosecutors believe that Osipov had to give way to the motorcyclist while driving from the side to the main road.
New Gazeta: Six Vagner employees killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian military soldiers and six people belonging to the military company Vagner.
This is according to a source in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the 5th Syrian military corps units was deployed in the area, which was joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries".
The Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian foreign ministry with a request to provide information on the Russian fate.
The former king of Belgium will have to perform a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphina Boel.
Since 2013, she has sought to be recognized as a child of the former monarch.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old ex-king denies paternity.
According to RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis, the former husband of the Delphine mother, is neither biological nor legal father of the artist.
Delphine applied for the relevant investigation in order to be recognized as the "true" daughter of Albert's father.
VRK will allocate money to parties, but will not give anything to social workers
This week, the Supreme Electoral Commission (SEC) is planning to allocate a budget grant of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million to the largest political parties.
This spring, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Deputy Speaker of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilo, has not yet been allocated funds from the budget.
But they can be granted in the near future by a separate decision of the HRC, if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aite, chairman of the VRK, informed the HR that "this Thursday a meeting of the Commission is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of a half-year budget grant to the parties".
According to her, the HRC has to take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0,0 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,0 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.55 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.5 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0 million for the opposition Liberals, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million for the opposition party, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>
Under the current law, which also governs the VRC in the distribution of budget money, grants are awarded to parties that comply with the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the vote during the last sessions of the Seimas, the Municipal Councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, set up this spring alone, to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet taken part in a single election.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros as they approach the next three elections - the municipal government, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendment of the laws of the political parties and this year’s budget was vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the ruling representatives of Mr. Kirkil and the leader of the state-Greens, Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president’s objections.
However, this will not be done until this Thursday's meeting of the HRC, which is why, according to Mr Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>ait<0xC4><0x97>, "grants will be divided according to the legal procedure that still exists".
Indeed, the Head of the HRC did not deny that if the Seimas rejected the President’s veto and new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to the parties this week or next, a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to the individual political forces and the LDP could be considered in the Commission.
"When we take a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in place, because we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that are adopted," she said.
If the Seimas could reject the veto and the new laws would come into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties under them, with the corresponding amounts being additionally borrowed.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poo<0xC5><0xA1>enka: Activist Handziuk's Murder Orders Must Be Punished
"I want to say that no version - and there are more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
I, as president, have no opportunity and do not have to receive information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish the evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with the youth in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most interested in K. Handziuk’s murder to be clarified, and that the killers, crime organisers and commanders would “take the necessary responsibility.”
"After this case has been re-qualified for murder, they are in full correct and reasonable danger of life imprisonment," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public’s demand for an open and impartial examination of the case.
Poro<0xC5><0xA1>enka stressed that statements by representatives of law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that "the government has decidedly decided to attract criminals and murderers with responsibility, whatever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on this issue will not help to clarify the situation, and will further confuse everything.
"I urge all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to clear up unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations," he said.
"On the contrary, we must now come together and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - such that it raises the public's confidence.
We just don’t have another way.”
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the country,” he said.
In July, Handziuk, who fought corruption, was attacked and surrounded by acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died Sunday at the hospital.
When the perpetrators of the attack were not explained to the police and prosecutors, Ukraine’s attorney general, Yuriy Luchenko, made a statement on Tuesday.
After her death, the authorities received accusations from public activists that she was unable to carry out the investigation properly.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"Today, I am making a statement of my resignation," Lucenka told members of parliament after reading the report of his investigation.
Parliament still has to agree to the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of K. Handziuk.
Bill Gates presents toilet without water
In presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates’ transition from traditional such devices to water-free was leveled with the 1980s computer revolution of the last century.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet in Beijing that doesn’t need water pipes, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
Toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid wastes.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies you see here are the biggest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years," Gates said in a statement.
The technological toilet was created with funds from a charitable foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, work was done on a device that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, with the fund spending $200 million.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
Combating the problems of poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the amount of money spent on health care, which is already at 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates goes to a toilet presentation in a glass with fecals.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small sample, “there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs.”
S. Slyva elected as president of the Association of Massive Football
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Association of Mass Football was held in Kaunas, where Sergey Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
As a result of Anatoly Stecenko’s request to resign from the presidency of the Association, an extraordinary general meeting of members of the Association was convened.
It was attended by 13 members out of 15.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates, Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rasteni, participated in the elections.
11 members of the association voted for S.Slyva, two members voted for V.Rasten.
Slyva will complete the term of office started by A. Stecenko, which will continue until January 2021.
Worrying in France: Worrying causes people's deaths
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide that has caused concern over the number of people who have been poisoned in the west of the country in recent decades.
The health agency ANSES has announced that the decision to ban all pesticide products was made after a new safety check launched earlier this year, at least before the poisoning wave in the Department of Arts and Sciences began on September 3.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used every year for around 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the An<0xC5><0xBE>a region, where many salad soups are grown, complained of eye and throat congestion, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but it has not accelerated it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Methamphetamine - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to be a "probable human carcinogen".
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new security check is to be carried out.
“There was no other choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives,” Weber told the newspaper.
“We understand what difficulties will arise for the producers of salads, for the farmers in general, but public health is more important,” she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methamphetamine in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed annually in Europe is grown near Nanto.
The next season will be "much less salad dressings, risottos and couples", after the government stopped using methamphetamine last month, said Philippe Retiere, head of the Nanto Federation of Growers.
Taline invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million in a shopping centre with a review wheel
Next weekend, a new T1 shopping centre will be opened in the Estonian capital, to which Pro Kapital Grupp, a local real estate development company, has invested 70 million euros.
A total of 130,000 square meters, or 55,000 square meters of rented space, will be located in a shopping mall with 150 shops or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer’s report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolio" (calculated together with the area for offices) reaches about 110,000 sq. m. and rents - 91,000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping center with a view wheel on the roof, says the developer.
It will start at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: trams will be standing next to them, intercity buses will soon be running.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also located nearby, which is expected to serve 1 million passengers a year by 2026.
Paolas Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that there are significant changes in the business of global shopping malls, and in the development of T1 it has managed to come to their fore.
“We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experience that are not accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the city center itself, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthy object to visit and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
A lot of attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltics.
A total of 12,000 sq.m. is allocated to the entertainment facility, or one-fifth of the total rental area.
An exceptional accent - on the roof is equipped with a review wheel.
It will rise to a height of 120 m above sea level - in Taline higher than only the TV tower.
After the review round, on the fourth floor, Super Skypark will operate, here opening the largest shoe centre in Europe and the first basketball and net square in Estonia on the shoe, the company says.
In the interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are promised to take at least 5-6 hours.
A 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema will be located in the entertainment complex.
In addition to the regular cinema, shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to feel in the virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
Along with visual effects and moving at the rhythm of the movie chairs, the feeling of reality here will strengthen the combined effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the choice of scents, smoke or smoke in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia’s tourism revenue by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group in Lithuania received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 million in sales revenue and suffered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>350,000 in losses, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 million of sales revenue was received on the Lithuanian market and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 million of net profit was earned.
The T1 shopping center was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya sworn in after a controversial seven-term election
During the 85-year-old ceremony under the supervision of Parliament President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya promised to safeguard the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
The oldest African president to rule his country for 35 years has been declared the winner in the October 7 election, which garnered 71% of the vote.
However, the election was hampered by low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were kidnapped at a presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are campaigning for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million people are French-speaking and one-fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the northwestern and neighboring Southwest provinces, after the dissatisfaction over alleged discrimination in the areas of education, justice and the economy, autonomy began to be demanded.
In 2017, Biya refused to let go of the radicals and declared an independent state, the “Republic of the Embassy”, and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed this year during the separatist attacks and responsible government operations.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence: some are crossing the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-desert forests.
In October, only 5% of voters voted in the northwestern region and 15% in the province of the Southwest.
In both parts of the country, Biya garnered two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes caused by inexperience
“When something is missing in places, realize that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed us to use their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who have borrowed,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not fundamentally change, and the violations themselves are not of a malicious nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were experienced - it was also news to them.
So from this inexperience not all the actions corresponded to our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK to comply with our described principles.
These complaints, however, do not constitute grounds for doubting the results," Anushauskas said.
According to the President of the CRK, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been printed - after learning about this, ballot papers found in ballot boxes without a stamp have been cancelled.
In some towns, there was a lack of space, but according to A. Anushausko, complaints and violations are linked to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really doesn't make a significant difference to the election results," Anushauskas explained.
It is claimed that the party's voter turnout was 55%, while the non-partisan turnout was 69%.
The two candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - 79% of voters (16,418 votes) voted for Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>acka.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>’s candidacy in the presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says he's unlikely to meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has previously said that Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will take place this week.
But as he walked into the final meetings ahead of the midterm elections in the U.S. Congress, Trump told reporters he was not sure if this would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” said the president of the United States.
However, the head of the White House added, they will meet during the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" after that.
Trump is still trying to "reload" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
K<0xC4><0xB1>stutis Strupas asks to cancel VTEK’s decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, the former Director General of the Clinics of Santaras, Vilnius University, has asked to repeal the decision of the Supreme Administrative Ethics Commission (VTEK) - he has been recognized as having not declared transactions in time and thus violated the law.
The complaint was examined by the administrative court of Vilnius County on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK on 23 May, the BNS informed the representative of the court Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97>.
Mr. Strupas believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, he claims, having understood the exception of the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then retired General Director of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and the head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation at Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97> violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared non-compliance with the stipulated deadlines: in 2010 a loan was taken from the bank with the spouse, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, the daughter was given a gift in 2017 - an apartment and in 1996 together with the married natural person was granted and not granted.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions on expiry of the terms.
Persons who violate the Law on the Harmonization of Public and Private Interests in the Public Service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own, but also your spouse’s data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of Info TV information.
Explaining whether K. Strupas and his wife, the head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Vilnius, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, correctly and on time declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year, Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>125,000.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinic and his wife were not mentioned in the declarations of interest.
Law enforcement K. Strupa, along with at least ten other people, has raised suspicions in a corruption investigation - according to law enforcement officials, for winning public computers, the purchase of software in clinics from companies required for illegal financial compensation, he is disguised as a paramedic.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have lasted at least five times in the Santaras clinics during public procurement in the field of information technology.
K. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
The corruption suspect Professor K. Strupas was fired from the post of head of the Santara clinic in September.
By decision of the Ministry of Health Protection of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University, working relations with K. Strup<0xC5><0xB3> should be terminated at his own request.
He has been in the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis continues to temporarily lead the Santaras clinics until a contest for the new director-general is held, promising to be announced later this year.

In schools already want to learn differently: promises less tests, more practices
These changes are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Change of education content: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>, speaking at the debate, said that over the past ten years, over 30 million euros have been invested in the content of education, but the results have not been seen.
“According to the results of the international student achievement survey PISA, student achievement is below the OECD average,” said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
Phil Lambert, an expert at the OECD, said in a statement from the Ministry of Education and Science that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge and not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, the general education programs focus a lot on students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility for education, but also on children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy.
The Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, presenting the changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the renewal programmes started this academic year will be smaller, more concrete, and the disciplines more closely linked to each other.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of students will be more individualized, the schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 percent of their unique educational content, the current student assessment system will change to a cumulative score, a greater weight gain and informal introduction.
Smaller standardized tests.
The general education programmes are requested to be digital, convenient to use, linked to e-resources, to the task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve student achievement in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between student achievement and modern competences at school by a third, to be written in different areas.
Since May 2018, Lithuania plans to update the content of the education programme with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million for the European Union and the state budget.
It is expected that the draft general education programmes updated in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in some schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for the implementation of a project worth almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million for initial, primary and secondary education programmes.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million was earmarked for the four-year period and the first purchase of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, with the aim of looking for educational programme developers.
After the experts criticized this purchase, he was stopped, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> fired Giedri Vaidel, director of the Education Development Center.
In Lithuania - exercises, how to react to an extreme flood
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise to improve the response of the authorities to an extreme flood begins on Monday.
as reported by the Fire Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will examine how the state authorities have been prepared to work in the country in an emergency situation, such as a flood: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the evacuation of people
More than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as from 12 municipalities of extreme situation operations centres will participate in the exercises.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on 5-13 November, during which the municipalities, receiving information from the Hydrometeorology Service of the PAGD on non-surgical falls and the start of the flood, will take decisions on the management of the extreme situation.
The active exercise phase is scheduled for November 14-15.
During this period, the Department will operate the State Centre for Operations of Extreme Situations, and the State and municipal institutions - the Centres for Operations of Institutions of Extreme Situations.
When the Government is informed of the state-level state-of-the-art emergency situation as a result of the flood, the Prime Minister-designated Operations Manager will lead to the eradication of the emergency, the elimination of its effects, and actions to protect and rescue the population and property.
Deputy Director of the PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that it is important in the exercises to check the readiness of the authorities to carry out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibility of exchange of information, to check the readiness of the authorities to warn and inform the authorities, the state
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters-salvators to pump a large amount of water from the besieged areas.
For this purpose, the module "BaltFloodCombat" was established in 2009.
Yuriy Lucenko, Prosecutor General of Ukraine resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuriy Lucenko said Tuesday in a speech in the country's parliament that he was "retired" for the resonance caused by the death of the acid-filled anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net reported.
According to Ukrainian law, the request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, and this must be submitted by a majority vote approved by the Supreme Council.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko presented a law enforcement investigation into the progress and results of the order for the murder of K. Gandziuk in the Supreme Council.
In his speech to parliamentarians, he described the study as effective, but expressed outrage that the death of K. Gandziuk was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandzyuk was a Ukrainian activist fighting corruption, publicly speaking about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson, southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, slapped acid on her face.
On November 4, she died in a hospital due to injuries.
Protesters at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine are demanding an answer to what killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix said.
According to J. Lucenko, in the law enforcement investigation, 12 people are possibly associated with the murder order of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was destroyed by the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Prosecutor General, the suspects received essential information from them as a result of the leak.
Lucenko added that he personally knew Gandziuk and was angry that some politicians were exploiting her blood for public relations.
“In order for no one to have reason to say that someone who is self-righteous is in authority, I want to say that I make a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you in Parliament will have to consider this issue," Lucenko's speech in the Rada quoted Obozrevatel as saying.
Lucenko added that "it is impossible to allow a dual government in the country when the law enforcement system is broken down without any evidence, even for the crimes that have been exposed."
J. Lucenko is considered a close co-worker of the President of the country Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after lengthy attempts to remove his predecessor from the post, suspected of bribery by top-level officials and politicians, Viktor Shokin.
Minister of Energy Z. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As Energy Minister Aurelija Vernickait<0xC4><0x97> informed Elta, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC) data, transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the EU-wide share of the trajectories provided for in the cumulative national renewable energy action plans - in 2015 it accounted for 6% of renewable energy.
According to the EC, progress towards a mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a lower role at this stage.
Seimas took the issue of a proposal for a corruption investigation to supplement the Conservatives’ appeal to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday, after the submission, approved a proposal that was registered for an investigation into the illegal influence on political processes by the "citizen" Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, 27 before, nine parliamentarians abstained.
The project will then be considered by the Seimas Committees, which will be chaired by A. Shirinskienes’ Committee on Law and Order.
Upon receipt of its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of an amendment to the decision.
The Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, which is currently conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been ordered to explain the possible illegal impact in 2008-2016.
Shirinskien<0xC4><0x97> suggested that the term should be extended by stating that "significant information on possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public space".
In the project, A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> mentions "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of important independent institutions such as the Supreme Commission on Service Ethics".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "states" found that the conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
With the influence of the Supreme Commission on Civil Ethics (VTEK), the leaders of "nationals" accuse the former co-worker Povila Urb<0xC5><0xA1>i.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas State Management and Municipal Committee was able to instruct VTEK members to discharge the former head of the Commission’s Prevention Division, Mindaugas Siaur.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of the authorities or their groups, the impact on the conduct of elections, the formation of coalitions, parliamentary factions, the work of individual politicians, the participation of parties and social movements in the process and the financing of the elections.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities, how they responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of "nationals".
Its members were also appointed by two social workers, after one "schedule", a liberal and a representative of the Union of Action-Christian Families of the Polish-Lithuanian Elections.
Conservatives and Social Democrats have refused to participate in the committee’s work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, president of the ruling Lithuanian states and the Green Union.
According to him, an investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) conducted last session showed essentially the same things that the investigation needs to be continued.
Germany’s intelligence chief has lost his job.
The 55-year-old, H. G. Maassen, has yet to face controversy after claiming that he was blamed for his troubles by the "radical left-wing force" in the Merkel coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to go out into reserve.
Among other things, it turned out last weekend that in a meeting of representatives of the European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, H. G. Maassen criticised Merkel's "na<0xC3><0xAF>ve" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has been defending the intelligence chief for a long time, said at a press conference on Monday that recent comments by H. G. Maassen were unacceptable and "disappointed personally".
Seehofer, who himself was under pressure both for this dispute and for the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Franko-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen in reserve.
Previous articleCurrent shark attacks terrorized the entire island – a third person has already been poisoned
According to a statement from the Queensland Emergency Services, the victim of the attack near the Sekmani Islands, Sid Harbor, on the coast of the state of Queensland, had suffered "swelling of his legs and wrists".
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
The island of Sekmini is the largest of the same name in the archipelago, attracting many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have so far been relatively rare.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.

Innocent girls ruin stereotypes about wedding dresses <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Innocent girl with a white blow in a wedding dress - mission (not) possible?
Can the white carpet floating towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
In addition to the reality show "Daddy's (r) evolution", participants will already today prove that the beauty and elegance of the wedding really does not depend on the woman's kilos.
But that's not all - one of the girls on the project tonight will touch the tears of happiness - her boyfriend will appear in the filming field.
“But there are those who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or the attention of guys.
It's just a myth - my guy himself is an athlete, but he likes me, he doesn't require a figure that meets some standards from me," - before the performance with the wedding dress talk show participant Aurika.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, clothing - it is a complex structure, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in herself.
I can rest assured that the appropriately chosen dress model really solves this "problem"," explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided together with the entire commission - in addition to the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagli Bieranc and TV producer Laura Paukste.
“When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of pitfalls between the members of the commission – because we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of the demonstration of wedding dresses was even more difficult, and it is - I can now reveal - that two innovations appeared, which were certainly not worse than antiques.
It was a special night in every sense,” says R. Kalinkinas.
The news - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famous Ieva and 31 year of the mother of two children of exceptional beauty Dovil<0xC4><0x97> - like the other girls participated in the selection of "Dyd<0xC5><0xBE>i (r)evolution" and got into the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of girls in the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl returned to the show to LNK viewers for her favorite voice on the television portal.
The second week of the show of the reality of the beauty of the bridesmaids in Lithuania, which has received international recognition, is already taking place - here a plus size girl is competing for the name of a plus size star in the first country.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they are all well aware that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Dyd<0xC5><0xBE>ios (r)evolution" begins already this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in the world
The American magazine People has announced the sexiest man in the world this year.
It was made by 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, telling him about the new title, he did not lack the wits.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought – yes, I look sexy today – laughing at the actor sharing.
Speaking openly, Idriss noted that this title is a very pleasant feeling that engendered his ego.
The British star is believed to have often hoarded stolen words and feelings, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he calls it, he was "very tall and restless".
The young actor did not trust his contemporaries and became an object of his own, both for his rare and unusual name and for his African origins.
“I’ve just become the toughest guy in my city,” Idris smiles.
When a man fails to be the greatestOse on screen, I. Elba works as a DJ at parties held in Spain, and especially in a busy Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a sparkle of fashion he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor believes that the most important thing in the world is his family, so he plans to marry his fiancé, Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world, chosen by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
A man stabbed to death in a snorkeling area
On Monday evening in the <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC5><0xB3> village in the <0xC5><0xA0>irvint<0xC5><0xB3> district, a man who was fatally beaten during a drinking session.
According to Vilnius County Police, a report received at 9:16 p.m. that the man hit a neighbor during the drinks.
When doctors arrived, the death of the man who was born in 1943 was confirmed.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was arrested and was found to be drunk at a rate of 2.53.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident.
Managers do not require a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built, near the Gari<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0xB3> market.
Managers no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from the residents when building waste incineration plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika on Monday registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the group of "citizens", which had previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, promised to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos’ amendment foresees that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built to meet the environmental and public health requirements laid down by law.
He admits that the amendment raised the president’s doubts about such insurance.
"Given the definition of residential area, it is clear that such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to find," the chairman of the committee said.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president’s veto strikes, intensifying the construction of waste-burning power plants.
In addition to the ban on the use of incineration plants closer than 20 km from the population, the amendments provided for an authorisation for the government to take decisions on the future of the two already built power plants, taking into account public health interests.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika's recent provisions do not propose to be amended.
The energy group “Lietuvos energija” (Lietuvos energija) and the Finnish energy group “Fortum” (Fortum Heat Lietuva) are producing waste and biofuels in Vilnius and Kaunas.
The last one is burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talk about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
LONDON (Reuters) - UK and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on a complex issue in Northern Ireland that is calling for Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the so-called “deterrent mechanism” to allow for an open border between the province of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal, but has rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, May "has raised the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of circumvention measures," it says.
"Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not related to a unilateral decision to discontinue the application of circumvention measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators are not finding an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland border when Britain leaves the Common Market and Customs Union in March next year.
The two sides agree on "concern measures" to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominica Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from a deal of circumstantial measures unilaterally after three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"Three months or a limited period of circumvention measures are not worth the paper on which it will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations after a week-long announcement in Britain that the deal was hand-in-hand.
"I would say that we are still making progress in the negotiations, but the work is still there," May said in a statement.
Margarita Schin, the European Commission’s representative, also told reporters: “We’re not there yet.”
Nobel Prize laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, on Monday issued a statement calling for the right to reliable information in an age of the Internet.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas (Amartja Senas) and Joseph Stiglitzas (Josef Stiglitz), Nobel Peace Prize winner Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (<0xC5><0x9E>ir<0xC4><0xAB>r<0xC4><0xAB>n Ebad<0xC4><0xAB>s), as well
"We call on good will leaders in all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that "the global space of information and communication" is a common good, which "must be safeguarded in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views."
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and distributed based on the truth of the commitment, principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," the statement added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), who often criticizes the "false news" but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should take a stand on this issue when they convene the “Forum for Peace” in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories said.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deloire), head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalist rights organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf (Abdu Diouf), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Fukuyama).
Previous articleSeim Confirms Increased Fines for Harmful Products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provide that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Health Committee, said in a statement on the new project, it is welcome that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed bill, is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further infringements because the entities, after paying the fine, continue to commit repeated infringements,” Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
Amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen consumer protection, to give more power to market surveillance authorities and to establish a clear system of requirements for product safety and their compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, manufacturers are currently not under an obligation to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities are not given the right to enter the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which makes the work of the authorities more difficult.
According to the Ministry’s assessment, the six-month deadline for the award of penalties and warnings is too short to identify the violation, carry out the investigation and assign the penalty.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did so.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product and to ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to provide market surveillance authorities with the right to access, in the course of national product safety control, the market, territory, buildings, premises and inspections of the operators producing the products.
It is intended to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between 144 and 1,448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, the importer or the authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor, on the market where they are supplied, the provider of dangerous services or service providers.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>868 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,344) would be imposed on the State Consumer Protection Service (SPC) or another market surveillance authority to prohibit the placing on the market and the supply of dangerous products or services.
Without the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of between 2500 and 6,500 (now between 1,448 and 5,792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products did harm to consumer health, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,1584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, a fine of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 is imposed in Poland and Austria for violation of product safety legislation (minimum fine not established), in Belgium - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>26 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600,000 fine, in Romania - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>155 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>665 fine - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>666 fine
10-year-old receives baby: was raped by a family member
The incident in Colombia has affected millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby sees the world thanks to Caesar’s cut, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For some time, the doctors took care of them.
It's still a while before the young mother and child will be home.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the little girl became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - a brother," the director of the hospital in which the birth was accepted told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and violence against the child.
The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and remote areas of the country.
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country’s capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO exercises "Tri<0xC5><0xA1>ak<0xC4><0x97> Connect 2018" - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from Norway’s second military battalion after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan – that is, in the warm lands.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting under Arctic conditions, and their skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and remote areas, have been involved in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in a harsh climate, they have to exert much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers at the headquarters say that they share their skills in how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, is very reminiscent of real combat, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Workers in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
The Kaunas residents, after observing the workers blowing up in Kaunas Castle, will find that work is finally underway on the reconstruction of the remaining tower.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis, director of the Kaunas City Museum, believed that the works of changing the roof of the roof of the defensive wall are taking place here.
According to the postman, the roofs will be slippery.
"The wearing of an emergency situation caused a threat to the environment - people could get stuck and hurt - so it was necessary to change it.
The floors were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also damaging to the heritage,” explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All the work is combined with heritage and other institutions", - Mr Su<0xC5><0xBE>aid<0xC4><0x97>lis added that the result should be as authentic as possible, but at the same time an important and practical side - roofing values must protect against moisture.
A universal solution is chosen when working with heritage.
Prior to this, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical values," the director of the Kaunas City Museum said.
The contract was signed on October 2nd.
It is planned that the works will not be longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
“It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November,” the museum director said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to Postnekov, was provided for in this year's budget.
Work in Kaunas Castle is carried out by the company "Statija".

Eastern European Studies Center collaborates with two prominent U.S. "brain centers"
According to Lino Kojalos, head of RESC, based in Vilnius and counting the already thirty years of activity, the hiring of the US will allow the projects to be implemented and will make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge, with the security, disinformation and development themes of the Eastern Partnership countries being analyzed by us, they are also of priority," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the RESC and the US authorities will work together to prepare international project applications, exchange expert experience and knowledge, prepare expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, so both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
The latest University of Pennsylvania ranked FPRI seventh in its category in the global ranking of analytical centers.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work in the top U.S. political institutions, ranks 10th in its category in the same ranking.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to move into the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel higher," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist the partners in distributing the forthcoming RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among U.S. decision-makers and in the public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the RESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

A Mexican Restaurant Helps Deported Migrants in the U.S.
The further away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and these are difficult to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, everything was taken away: the house, the car, the clothes.
They took everything except one thing - my knowledge," says Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
The restaurant board hopes that a better understanding of each other will be fostered by a combination of Mexican and American cultures.
A member of Afghanistan’s special forces shot an American instructor during training
The 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, has been on a year-long vacation to carry out a mission to Afghanistan.
He was a U.S. Army intelligence officer, but in January he had to return to work as a Marshal.
Another member of the U.S. military, whose name has not yet been released, was injured in a Saturday attack that killed Taylor.
According to officials, Mr. Taylor died from a pedestrian gun fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, the head of the National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army's capabilities.
Reuters quoted NATO media as saying that Taylor had been shot dead by one of the paid special forces and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains should be diverted to Dover Air Force Base in the state of Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was his second.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of battalion advisors and trainers from one of the country's special forces.
Hundreds of people gathered in the streets of a town of about 17,000 people in North Ogden to swoop down on their mayor, along with a family-run police escort card.
B. Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
