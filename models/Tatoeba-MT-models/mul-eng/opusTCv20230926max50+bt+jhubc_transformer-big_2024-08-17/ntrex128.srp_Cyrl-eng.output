The members of the Assembly of Great Britain are concerned about “similarities with Mapetovci”
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) have been renegotiated with a proposal to change their title to the Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This has come about because it is planned that the name of the Assembly be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all political appointees are concerned that they may thus become the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour party’s assembly said his party was concerned that the shortcoming “remains with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means chess, and pwp means cheating.
A member of the assembly from the political party "Plaid" said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and offered alternative names.
A prominent member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to name change, but noted that MWP was pronounced similar to Muppet (Mapetovci).
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh word "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a name change, issued the following statement: “The final decision on the descriptions of the title of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission has defined itself as the option of Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the option of MWP has received the widest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elina Jones, who is expected to be within a few weeks of drafting the bill on the amendments.
Reform laws will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Board system plan.
The members of the Assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate on the occasion of the above-mentioned law.
Macedonia to hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the new name of the state “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province under the name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern state represents the possession of its territory and has been persistently opposed to its membership requirements in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, represent the view that changing the name is simply a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin have calmed down, and the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I’ve talked to say there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one else today.”
The disappearance of the cafe is understandable.
“People today are friends in a different way,” he says.
“Caffeines no longer play the role of day-to-day wrestlers from the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the church, it is feared that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be again in the beginning.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of that kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries from the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will accelerate the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who settle in these residential buildings will become their members.”
Both churches built communities made up of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved away in the 1930s.
The black community that carried out the worship nearby took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin took over a black community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, but since the parishioners of Johnson's father decided to rebuild it, they ordered the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the orgula "the orgula of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them differently: "culturally good" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that they were the first organ in the world played by some black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger organ at Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriveder stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have been led by the world leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish administration – the governing body of the parish, composed of world leaders – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to transfer costs “to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in the parish and was not involved in the parish.
Some parishioners complained of non-transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old During Hunting in California Yards
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he dived in search of the lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday, about half an hour, he crashed with friends when he heard the boy's call for help, and then hung up with the group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that it was just a thrill to catch a javelin, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘I was bitten!
She hugged me.”
Members of the Assembly of all political appointees are concerned that they may thus become the subject of ridicule.
“I urged everyone to come out of the water: ‘A shark is in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Superintendent Larry Jayles said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it was determined not to belong to a dangerous species.
Jayles added that the victim had suffered a traumatic injury to the upper part of the body.
Officials have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Jays pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with department stores of cosmetic products in the style of department stores where expert assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough to the cosmetic products market in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds, with this figure growing while sales on the fashion markets and household waste equipment, the larger department of cosmetic products will be tested as a seed in 11 stores
The investment in cosmetic products comes from the fact that supermarkets find ways to take advantage of the shelf space after complaints about TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double the range of cosmetic products to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the Boutique makeup palette so that most products are vegan-friendly – so demand is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late in the year.
Buying online and switching to a daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Cup, executive director of Sainsbury's, said the outlet department will increasingly resemble self-services because the supermarket chain is trying to kick back sales facilities with large discounts of Aldi and Lidl non-services and more.
Sainsbury’s retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which it says has increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the acquisition.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to modernize the departments for cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended in an infamous manner.
The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with the Boots store in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after reporting a win in the revenue division of pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes into effect after Sainsbury's sold a pharmaceutical company three years ago with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by presenting an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and experience of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a better environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at the service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical location make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for the way of buying.”
Peter Jones has become “crazy” after retiring Holly Willoby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job
Peter Jones, the star of the series "Dragons Den", "crazed" after TV host Holly Willoby pulled out of a $11 million deal with his personal brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilobi does not have time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
The couple's company has partnered with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old announced her departure via her social network Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoby has angered Peter Jones, the star of the series "Dragons" Den, by withdrawing at the last minute from profitable business with their brand to focus on her own new import deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones "crazed" when a TV fan was on the TV screen during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the seat of his business empire in Marlowe, in Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new offers worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million of time was not spent.
The company has partnered with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoby’s estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoby, 37, announced via Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on one of his weekends.
According to the source: “Holi put the brand Truly at the very top of the priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term plan from which she would earn in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse at the Marlowe headquarters is packed with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of the “This Morning” program, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, as well as clothes and clothes.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoby, who is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin, has been close to Jones and his wife, Taro Cap, for ten years.
Wiloby founded Truly with Capo in 2016, and in March joined them as the company's CEO, Jones, 52.
These couples are celebrating the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production house.
Willoby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity TV channel ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After heavy words, “sympathies appeared”
He found himself on the occasion of criticism in the media over comments that some say are “not worthy of the president” and because of a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump withdraw so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“We don’t withdraw from anything.”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly held on Saturday that there was no "appropriate response" from the United States to the initial North Koreans.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is not abolishing sanctions that are under constant pressure from the United States.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are making tremendous progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
We now have a great relationship.”
He pointed out that his efforts to improve relations with Kim gave positive results – missile tests were over, hostages were released, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
This unusual approach was defended by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would stand there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, leaving behind hundreds of dead
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, the example works, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the island's population has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization consists of a team that will travel to Pal, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pal in order to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes that rock Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in A<0xC4><0x8D>eh, they can rarely be found on other beaches.
The loss of life probably contributed to the apparent failure of the siren to warn of a tsunami in Palou, although the warning was in force.
Travel between a number of Indonesian islands and otherwise is a challenge.
Natural disasters also make logistics more difficult to deal with.
A hospital ship that was stationed on the island of Lombok to provide assistance to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pal, but it will take him at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Vidodo has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia’s enduring infrastructure and has not saved money for roads and railways.
However, the lack of financial resources hit the Jokoa administration, and next year he is due to run for re-election.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure that creates long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets, serving as machetes, arches and arrows and other weapons of mass destruction.
Watch: Daniel Starridge, Liverpool player, manages to reach a leveling point against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat from Chelsea on Saturday with an 89th-minute touchdown at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
The old man received an addition from Jerdan Shaciri at 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He first moved the ball to the left, and then shot to the farthest part of the net.
The ball went high above the goal in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she flew the goalkeeper Cape Arisabalag, who jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
I was just trying to set myself up and set myself up for the punch, and players like Shaciri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible,” Starij told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched the ball once, and he was just joking, without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after Belgian star Eden Azhar in the 25th minute.
The striker returned the ball to Mateu Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in fifth, and then turned to the middle of the field and ran to the half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a few short strokes in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed a brilliant centershot, leading Azara to the goal.
Azar overtook the defense and directed the final shot with his left foot into the farthest part of the net alongside Alison Baker, a Liverpool player.
Liverpool played against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
There have been numerous reports of people trapped in rubble of buildings hit by a 7.5-degree earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters in height, the Sutopo Purvo Medferno news agency said.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, has been plagued by the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder was launched after a female body was found this morning in Berkenheid, Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Museum in John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people in the area who have seen or heard anything to call.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would invite anyone who was near John Street in Berkeley and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Berkenhed and that she was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know this woman came across the spot to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said it is currently informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Museum has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that everyone is prohibited from entering and leaving the building.
He was left without text when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that their return will only be allowed for a few hours.
It was reported that a police officer once told a man that the whole area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans were at the border with another van in front.
Several police officers were standing in the border watching residential blocks.
All who have some information are invited to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers Association at 0800 555 111 and cite the record 247 as of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate on monuments due to the controversy over the "fake history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for its destruction in the Taliban style of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace was an unmissable target in the current debate on the removal of the statue.
Cromwell did not issue an order or carry out an iconoclast during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the part of his uncle Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turnikroft testifies to the 19th century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure that, in many respects, still deserves to be magnified.
Goldsmith gave the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
The credibility of this description has, throughout history, been the subject of constant debate.
What is certain is that this conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as the bearer of the title Lord Protector also deserve to be magnified and kept from oblivion."
A pig-killer has inflicted a fatal injury on a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer attacked and killed a pig at a bar in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pig on a drink in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
The owner of the pig farm is preparing to inject injections into pigs in Xining in the province of Qingdao, China.
He reportedly came on Wednesday with a relative from the neighboring Yunan province to sell 15 pigs on a drink.
The next morning, he was struck by a dead man and noticed that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig that had blood on her mouth.
Forensic investigations have confirmed that a 250-kilogram-old pig was fatally injured by a farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and bruised,” said a relative who is referred to as “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows that Yuan entered the bar on Thursday at 4.40 am to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his relative.
The drink manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it would not attack anyone again, while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the drinking authorities are reportedly negotiating a banishment over his death.
Although this rarely happens, there have already been recorded cases of a pig attack on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked his wife and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to be critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram pig held a Welsh farmer in a tractor van until his wife poisoned the animal.
After farmers from Oregon ate pigs in 2012, a farmer from the province of Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be their “cattle.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread landslides to the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring plugs to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States that will lead to flooding.
Rosa, with winds of 137 km/h, on Saturday morning at 5 a.m. Eastern time, was Category 1 hurricane and was located 620 kilometers southwest of the settlement of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and moves east, towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push the high tropical rain to the north.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with the low-pressure field that is approaching will lead to widespread landslides in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous storm surges, water spills and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will locally cause falls of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a sharp worsening of conditions due to the unrelenting nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless to walk in the desert as it threatens the danger of tropical rain.
As a result of the abundant rainfall, the canyons can turn into smoky rivers, and storms with thunderstorms will lead to stormy winds and dust in the air.
A low-pressure field approaching will bring local heavy rain in some parts of southern California’s coast.
Amounts of precipitation of more than 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause less water damage and landslides.
It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
Monthly tropical rains will begin on Sunday evening and Monday morning to bring Arizona closer, and on Monday evening and Tuesday the fall will take over the entire area.
The plugs will expand to the southwestern part of Colorado, the southwestern part of Utah, the northeastern part of Arizona, and the northwestern part of New Mexico on Tuesday, and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large oscillations in temperatures across the U.S. are possible to cool the Arctic, while in tropical regions it will retain fairly warm weather.
This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature at small distances.
A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyne in Iowa there is a difference in temperature of almost 20 degrees.
The long-term summer heat will grow again in the next few days and expand.
In the greater central and eastern part of the United States is expected to warm early October with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
Temperatures in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavan's audition
More than 20 million people on Thursday on six television channels watched the thrilling testimony of a Supreme Court judge candidate, Brett Cavan, and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television houses breaking the regular schedule for Friday due to a turnaround at the last minute: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drinking and trying to get her clothes on at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a touching testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
That was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
She has calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of viewers in the offices.
By comparison, this number of spectators can match an audience that follows the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, with hosts of the "Opinion" show who strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, noted the greatest viewing of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process has aroused great interest even after the hearing.
Blake was a central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
After a statement from a moderate Republican's office said he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded on Friday morning how protesters shouted at him as he tried to link the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for a few minutes looking down as they hurt him, which CNN broadcast live.
“Here I stand in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think you’re telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, and so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said there was more to be said at the committee hearing.
All cable and television houses broadcast the events live hours later when the Justice Committee was supposed to vote to pursue Kavanaugh's candidacy for a full-fledged Senate.
However, Flake said he agreed to this only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which was persistently demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleika was partly convinced by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Fleik's choice had a heavyweight that it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” in the case of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for a single customs zone of Britain and the EU "completely meaningless".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested a suspect, Dayton Simpson, for the death of a University of Louisiana player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
Daytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the police department in Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses from the scene and reported that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB channel connected to the CBS network.
After she interrogated Simpson, police said she had confessed to Wade's death by stabbing him with a gun.
He was given a $350,000 bail, a lawyer said.
The office of the parish pathologist in East Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary report in which a gunshot wound from the bullet through the head to the door is cited as the cause of death.
Merit for help in the investigation that led to the arrest of the department is attributed to the Louisiana State Police Operations Unit for the capture of fugitives, the state criminological laboratory, the police department of the Southern University and local residents.
The director of the athletics department of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alva, thanked the local authorities for implementing the law on “betting and striving for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre high winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last year, the zone averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano tosses ash on Mexico City
The ash that casts the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
This centre has noted several mild seismological activities.
In pictures on social media, thin layers of ash could be seen on windscreens of cars in the municipalities of Mexico City, such as Hocimilka.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in a volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after supporters of independence clashed with the intervention police, while thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on demobilization, which the post shared with the apartment.
A group of masked separatists, forced by the intervention police, chased them with eggs and threw paint in the dust, so dark clouds of dust were created on the streets that usually top tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a fighting that the police forced on the pendrics.
The independence groups chanted for a few hours “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness” in the face of the Unionist protesters who chanted, “Live Spain.”
Fourteen people have received help due to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
The tension does not subside in a region designated for independence even a year after the October 1 referendum that the separatist Catalans celebrate, although Madrid has declared it illegal.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although the response was small in the future that the mass of people who opposed the separation boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Groups advocating for independence camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police forces. . . .
Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narciss Thermaes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year, we had one of the brightest moments.
My parents were crying out of happiness that they could have voted, but now we are in a non-exhaustive situation,” he said.
Despite the achievement of a key but close victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan parties advocating for independence have had difficulties to continue this year in the same spirit as many of their most notorious leaders were incarcerated in a coup d'état.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest on the phone in support of the police, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, has announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Extinction of the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the deterioration of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after being hit by a car in a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car several times in a London home.
The incident took place on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent Street at about 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the entrance to the building itself was damaged.
It is also possible that at some point in the house a suicide shot was fired.
Menge's match brings Livingston victory over Rangers from 1-0
Dolly Menga secures first goal for Livingston
Livingston, after moving to the senior league, surprised Rangers by forcing Stephen Gerard to admit only a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Doli Manga made changes with his goal in the future, with Garry Holt's team equalising with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard’s team this season remains unbeaten in the Premier League guests, and next week he meets with the leaders on the Hartsim table, for which he has eight points left.
Before that, Rangers on Thursday came to the Rapid Vienna in the European League.
In the meantime, Livingston has extended the unbeaten streak in the six-game division, with head coach Holt not yet losing since he replaced Ken Miller last month.
Livingston has missed chances against uninspired guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the shootout he achieved, as he made Rangers trouble at all levels with the offensive game.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he wore the ball in front of the goal, so that Alan Litgow would joke alongside the net after he slipped in to receive a blow by Craig Halket's head in front of the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could set the difficulty of the guest team by the actions played.
In this way they achieved a key goal.
The Rangers made a foul, and Livingston opened the game after a free-kick by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to hire Meng who tracked the ball into the goal from the middle of the sixteenth.
In the previous part of the match, Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break the defending host, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
In the same style it continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one blow from Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, a Rangers goalkeeper, rejected Scott Pittman's attack and Lithgow shot alongside goal in Livingston's second-ever action.
Livingston defended several centrists, and two wanted penalties were also rejected – after Halket’s objection to replacing Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingston – analysis
Aladdin Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All the players, without exception, were exceptional and again exceed expectations on this uphill journey.
Since returning to the front lines they have hardly changed the style of the game and the people, but it is necessary to give great credit to Holt for the way in which he has brought vitality to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halket was undefeated in leading the top-tier organized defenses, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral on the ground all the time.
However, the Rangers were not impressed.
No matter how good he once was under Gerard, he fell far below that level.
They couldn’t point out – they only once broke the host’s defense – and that’s a kind of alarm bell for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an enters a mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during a breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues that include human rights, media freedom, and Turkey’s EU accession.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
Most of the Turkish population lives outside of Turkey in this city.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters were found nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of whom were Kurds – were also heard condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to give him a welcome in the country.
The clashing protests reflect the split of views on a visitor who some Turks in the German kitchen as heroes, and others accuse her of being an autocrat.
Accident on the way to Depford: Bicyclist killed in collision with car
In a car crash in London, a cyclist was killed.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and the hospital staff showed him help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months before this collision, another cyclist on Childers Street died, about 1.5 km from the collision that occurred on Saturday, which the driver struck and fled.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform him of his closest relatives.
The roads are closed and the bus routes have changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers were injured in riots
Six inmates were injured in a riot in a male prison with a high degree of security, the prison said.
The unrest that still persisted came at the prison of Her Majesty Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists has been brought in to deal with riots that have been reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners are involved.
On the spot, police officers were given assistance due to minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison officers have been brought in because of the current incident in Her Majesty’s Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the staff received help due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear from our position that the responsible person will be reported to the police, which would allow them to stay behind bars longer.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long Lartin there are 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was on hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the police intervention was called to prison for serious riots in which personnel were attacked by billiards bullets.
To the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, hurricanes threaten Rosa with torrential flooding (which can well come to areas affected by drought)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Ross moves across the desert to the southwest, bringing with it the risks of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for storm surges for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce the rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit a region 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict falls of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts up to 15 cm in isolated locations, such as Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5–5 cm, with possible total amounts in isolated places up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of the torrential rain that Rosa will bring may be a blessing since the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain in some parts will be welcome because in the southwest there is currently a drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit in the least by extreme drought, a category of the second order,” weather.com reports.
The journey of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the skirmishes on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning still had hurricane strength with a maximum windfall of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm found itself in colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it lost its strength.
That’s why it’s expected to reach a landslide in Mexico when the storm reaches the magnitude of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, abundant rainfall is possible, which brings a significant risk of flooding.
“The total amount of precipitation from 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora State, with a possible as much as 10 cm,” weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move higher through Arizona and on Tuesday late at night to the south.
“The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is the very abundant rain in Lower California, the northwestern Sonora, and the American desert in the southwest,” the National Hurricane Tracking Center said in a statement.
It is expected that this rain will lead to torrential floods dangerous to life and the spread of water-borne debris in the deserts and deserts on the hilly terrain.
Midsomer Northon attack: Four arrested for attempted murder <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
After a 16-year-old boy with stabbing wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in the town of Midsomer Northon, on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
He was transported to the hospital and is in stable condition.
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police have asked anyone who may have footage of this event on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffering the fall and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and shameful tactics,” Trump said in a speech in Wilinga, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffering the fall and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh, in a vigorous and emotional testimony on Thursday before Congress, denied Christine Blaise Ford's claims that she was sexually abused a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
During this hearing, Ford also testified to his claims.
The president said on Saturday that that day "the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in the public service,” he said in a statement.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during talks on the significance of Republicans' response to the midterm elections.
“Five weeks divide us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running for office, I am running for office,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates on all sides.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats are on a mission of “providing resistance and interference.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a statement by the GOP's senior aide to CNN.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have left hundreds dead, and that number is still growing.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them carrying giant waves that crashed on the beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, the competent authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA> on Friday at a beach festival when at dawn the six-meter-high waves struck the coast, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found on the road.
Tsunami swept an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 degrees.
"When he threatened a tsunami yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of fleeing immediately and therefore becoming victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian intelligence agency Jaffa.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it pulled cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and have survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA>.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the bridges have been distorted and collapsed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The storms hit the coastal city again on Saturday.
In the area where 2.4 million people live, there was an earthquake.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) has issued a statement saying that the energy of a devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical features of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of greater tsunami strength,” he said.
Nugroho said the damage had been done to “extremely large” houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho stated that larger losses and damage are possible along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely interrupted and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers were heading into the threatened areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various sides on Saturday that it had not issued a notification that the tsunami had hit Pal, although officials said the waves came at a time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared over social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is heard screaming from a five-lane fence, warning people on the street on a approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the coast, bearing buildings and cars.
Ritters was not immediately able to confirm the reliability of the footage.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, there was a power outage that caused a disruption of communications around the Palua, making it difficult for the competent authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The competent authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuated people were still overly dependent on food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is reopened only for assistance that arrives and remains closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centers in Palou on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the humanitarian organization World Vision safely arrived from Dongale to the city of Palua, where employees are hiding in water-resistant shelters set up in the courtyard of the office and on their way to the city were greeted by scenes of destruction and devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even when aid groups began to take the first steps in alleviating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign humanitarian workers with deep expertise would not be allowed to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas funds, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be characterized as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Pal after the earthquake and tsunami that struck him on Friday, the friends and families of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would, with some wonder, escape the sad fate of the victims of natural disasters.
The little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
Rescuers released a woman on Sunday under the rubble who had been trapped next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mandagi added.
“As a senior in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's destruction reached the paraglider community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palou who attended the beach festival.
However, his messages wore only one gray tag, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages are not delivered,” he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee facility
The thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who filled a ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money that he was supposed to put in the ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
All those who have information about their identities are invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
Posting this change on Saturday on his Twitter account, he wrote: “It will someday be known as the Kanye West.”
Vest, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes before its appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live", in which it is expected to announce a new album "Yandhi".
The show was called in instead of singer Ariana Grande, who declined for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
In addition to representing the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most spoken word in the Bible and it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“I’m you, I’m all of us, that’s all of us.
In the name of Cana, which means ‘the only one’, I went to only ‘Ye’ (ti) – which is the personification of all good, bad and unclear in us.
This album is basically a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, who is known by the nicknames Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, this year highlighted that he would like to be credited with "Love" and "Brother Love".
A former News co-worker, Jay-Z, used a nickname with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO says he will not use the army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students in Mexico has vowed never to apply military force to civilians.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco market that he would “never use an army to carry out repression against the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops shot peaceful protesters gathered in the market and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were based in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monetary aid each month to those who study and by opening even more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the impossibility of getting an education push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments followed after various U.S. governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for it.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
“To begin with, it would be good to double the budget for the exploration of artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so cascading for the United States, and we are striving for new progress in this area,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Super-power of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is working as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in the industry.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that won the highest-ranked U.S. Player's Hotel, and later was the director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee has given recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Robot Challenge” agency responsible for the development of new technologies (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be held, to help identify the next one.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
"Academic leaders don't go to China, they go to big corporations," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have employed prominent minds from the university to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
Lee points out that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a plan for the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations awarding money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from this sector and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation.”
On the other hand, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked their candidacy for membership in the European Union and the UN.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents the ownership of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe that such a change would threaten the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, majority Slovene population.
President Djordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the exit would reach a minimum of 50 percent, as to how much it would take for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot reads: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that this is the price that is worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the cover of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters went to the polls.
“I came out to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Djoshe Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zoric and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that should open the way for this country to membership in NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small bean and places the chairs in front of the tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the rightful heads, not through the service entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership would bring over the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate amounts to more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for membership in the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result "for" would be "confirming our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, concluded that 57% of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of that, 70 percent said they would vote ‘for’.
In order for the referendum to succeed, it is necessary to vote half of the registered voters plus one.
Failure to hold a referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since the takeover in May last year.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes the entire defense of Brighton and achieves the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling won 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, defeating Brighton in a 2–0 victory over Manchester City.
It seemed too easy when Aguero scored a touchdown in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an addition to the middle of the field from where he started the attack.
He ran between the three defensive players of Brighton, so he played all rounds in the open field.
At that time, Aguera was surrounded by four green shirts.
He picked up one defensive player, so he scored a few more on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he shot the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguera, who was right-handedly mastered by Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by shooting to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
"We've agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's the way it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that point.”
However, the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He pointed to the beautiful addition of Leroy Seine on the left side.
Sean had several contacts with the ball before he hired Sterling on the second leg.
The assailant of the Skydivers put the ball into the net, to immediately then slip out of the field.
Manchester City meet with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in a Champions League match at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play against Rocky in a game of no competitive importance for Neshnals
Since Neshnals was eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there was not much reason to insist on another match.
However, competitive-minded Sherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rocky, but only if the Rockys, who have one game of advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the play-offs.
The rookies secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over Neshnals, but still try to win the division's first title.
“While we can’t get anything, at least we can go out on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in such a competition?”
Neshnals has not yet announced the starter for a week, but is reportedly considering letting Sherzer throw in such a situation.
Chercer, who would be the 34th time to open the game, held the training on Thursday and will throw it on Sunday when he otherwise rests.
Washington's right-handed player this season leads 18-7 with an average of deserved runs of 2.53 and 300 car strikes in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holding a rally in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president briefly referred to the situation in which his candidate for a Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavano, was in talks about the significance of Republicans' response to the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve achieved in November will be put at risk.
Five weeks divides us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest ones – although I don’t run in person, I actually run, and that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates on all sides,” he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s going on now.
They are determined to regain power without choosing the means, see the fall, dirty games.
They don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we’re not going to give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission “to provide resistance and interference.”
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “innocent, disgusting, disgusting and dishonest.”
He mentioned the Democratic Senator and a member of the Committee on Justice Diane Fainstein by name, which caused a loud annoyance to the public.
“Do you remember her response?
Have you released a document to the public?
Uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for him – it was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts the different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I am only the last of a number of members of parliament from the Labour Party who were told they were not welcome – just because we expressed our views.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan River, went through a similar process because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the Censorship Initiative followed after criticism over the disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement for the meeting at the Labour Party in eastern Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive".
Since I was a member of parliament from the Labour Party for eight years, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, meetings in that spirit are rarely held today, and the promise of a “noble, moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever there were any such aspirations.
It becomes increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I had previously thought I would share similar political views began to expect from me to change them from the roots and take positions I would otherwise never agree with or disagree with – it would have been pointless to work with.
Every public address I make – regardless of what I say – is accompanied by a series of abuses on social networks calling for the annulment of my election, condemning the policy of the centre, telling me that there is no place for me in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments are directed to me usually political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a bulwark of sexist or racist insults, without ever bothering them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we no longer accept different views and with every vote of no confidence or change of the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more muted.
Over the past two years I have been often advised, urging me to lower my head, to keep my opinion to myself, and then I would “be fit.”
But it's up to my political goals.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school club, provoked by the reckless government of Margaret Thatcher, who allowed my school hall to literally collapse, I have been struggling to provide better public services to those who are most in need – or who are most in need.
I've never hidden my political affiliation, nor at the last election.
No one in the Eastern Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and topics about which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that, in the moments when our country is drifting towards Brexit that will threaten households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalties to the leader.
However, my only message is not intended for the organization Momentum of Nottingham, but for my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise to make no threats by canceling my election with no political party in the past.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air climbs to the top
Two delayed essays may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air took a deserved win in this exciting match of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they are at the top of the table, as the only unbeatable side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team took the lead thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of chances used and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested on matches so far and we haven't yet experienced a defeat, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said: “All thanks to Air, they took better advantage of their chances than we did.”
The 14th-minute essay by Grant Anderson, which was converted by Fraser Klimo, brought Air an advantage, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland, Rory Hugh, which the Warriors took out of the field, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage of the unplayed and unplayed bass.
The climate penalty increased the leadership of Ira, before, in the half-time, he achieved and converted a solo essay so that Ira on a break would reach a score of 17-5.
However, Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's essay, which Bagot converted, reduced the backlash to five points.
Then there was a prolonged pause due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on the stretchers, and Air subsequently increased the lead with the essay by Stafford McDowell, which was transformed by Klimo.
Then Captain Ira's deputy, Blair McFarson, received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player more so that Bruce Colvin failed to turn the essay, after a short hard pressure.
However, the host side came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to a scratch with the Clima without the ball, from the penalty line, McFirson recorded a tach down behind the Ira Mall in the attack.
Klimo turned the essay, which he did again almost immediately into a sequel, after Kyle Row picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth domestic essay.
‘Still Game’ star is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the series, Ford Kiernan, is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of the company holding licensed restaurants.
Jack Jarvis, a 56-year-old playwright in the popular BBC television series, is a screenwriter and actor along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series' broadcast and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for life after the Cruising season.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will allow it to re-enter the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the sea seat in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flags of the ocean are purple.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are sealed with the slogan: “We have a lot of right to the sea.
We have to get him back.”
In Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it a longing for yet another voyage into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in the last few decades, with Bolivia awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consideration.
“The Bolivian current development of the situation goes hand in hand, it is governed by the spirit of unity and tranquility and, of course, it expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that after decades of talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the accession of the sovereign.
For Eva Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of indigenous origin – who next year is expected to face a controversial fight for re-election – the verdict that will be made on Monday also carries a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that a little of that would change even if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was pronounced only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only did the Bolivian case not advance, but it may have been backed up by the previous four years.
“The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarata said.
Morales’ war rhetoric has killed every inclination toward Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political stronghold.
“Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it doesn’t have confidence in the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never cancel the nuclear weapons program if they do not have confidence in Washington.
On Saturday, Ri held a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises of the date during the Singapore summit in the talks of the conflicted leaders.
His comments came at a time when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hasn’t restarted the deadlocked diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after a meeting with North Korean Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it’s only a dream to let go of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government's general skepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness with regard to the renunciation of a nuclear arsenal that its country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion magazines are presented the latest line of bulky head covering accessories that you will soon see in the nearby main street.
If you want to enrich the collection of hats with more bulky models or to completely block the sun, the search is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have presented on the runway a series of huge head-scratching accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection, all of which have been filmed at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have ignited Instagram this summer, and these designers have showcased their impressive creations on the fashion runway.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was an overlaid beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like ring that swallowed the heads of the model by its size.
Among the other bulky additions, there were cabinets decorated with jewelry, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple – but they weren’t designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lektor than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment in a kit with a diaphragm and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in the cornet.
And if you get used to the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details – you’re in luck.
Those who follow trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on the nearby main streets.
Glossous hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a two-meter-wide circumference that has walked many celebrities - from Ryan to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, stood behind another great creation that was shown on the runway – straw beach bags of almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit he was wearing.
Jacquemous’s collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week highlighted the most a bag of raffia in the color of burnt orange, bordered by raffia and with a white leather handle on top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags next summer to arrive in the main street – since the designer has made so many booms, it would be hard to ignore so much demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for global citizens. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding results on tests, which is further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for the devil in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will get into his head.
If you speak in his mother tongue, it will touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's tests, we see that the languages at the top of the league table are the highest passing scores in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who taught foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A rating from the Mandarin language, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and other educational institutions as a subject of choice.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of employers cited language unfamiliarity as a major problem when filling vacancies, according to a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
In view of the more potential business opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess skills like this for a lifetime.
The possibility of direct communication with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they didn’t speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language that spoke a double-digit 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding significant employment.
In every school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are thought to be most important for the UK to be viewed ahead of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, in independent schools there will always be available more languages to choose from, with teaching staff who are expert in that field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever may await them in the future.
It cannot be denied that today, in a global business environment, languages are still of key importance for the future of the country, so they must have their place in education as well.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity, and exceptional achievement.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
It’s nearing the end of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James first starting for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a week-long pre-season game against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But his exact timing has yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James was likely to have a limited-minute run.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers pre-season schedule with six games.
"I don't need a pre-season game at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies this evening as part of a campaign in Willinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with reservations in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since a vote has been postponed to confirm his candidate to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are threatened with losing control of the House of Representatives when it comes to the House of Representatives.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willingen, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be watched live on YouTube as he continues to stream online.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearings for Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with an expected vote for confirmation of admission to the Senate being postponed for a week until Friday.
However, this series of rallies is being held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the run-up to the November elections.
Therefore, as part of President Trump’s campaign, it is pointed out that these five rallies to be held next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“The significance of congressional control is so great for his program of work that the president will travel to as many countries as possible at the start of the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be named.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco arena in Willing, could rally supporters from "Ohaya and Pennsylvania, with media transmission from Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, a country in which he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent points, will be second on Saturday in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morisei, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to raise him in the polls,” Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Shows Decisiveness in Fighting to Stay in Game to Meet Single Matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a couple’s tournament on Saturday afternoon is perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentum variability is an invented sports concept, players really believe in it, and especially in competitions of this type.
So, on whose side would you say that now is a moment?
"They had a six-point lead, and now four, so it can be said that the momentum is on our side," Jordan Spitt said on his departure.
Europe is, of course, ahead of us with four points of advantage and twelve more in the game.
Although Americans, according to Aska, get a little wind in the back and have a lot of that on their side, especially the form of Aska and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spit was murdered from the first to the last blow and assigned to all the domestic task.
The charms became more and more loud during his round, so that he would eventually play a key final blow and get a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas were left behind by two after two.
His final blow, which they received a 15-hole match, was greeted with a similar scream, reflecting the belief that the American team did not fall out.
“Basically, you just have to give your best and take care of your own sword,” Spitt said.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a seal.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who are without a doubt the story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual and equally charming European couple has won all four matches and played without a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't play the Gods of Strike on Saturday afternoon, but they were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the second half on Friday morning.
The game that they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with the noisy audience have cemented them to the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory at the entrance of the National Sunbathing.
If possible, both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly mastered Serge Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in a hole from which they never even managed to emerge.
Although, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
A four-ball game and a pair tournament are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they give and which they do not give and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great lead before the final day, but this couple’s tournament session has also shown that the U.S. team has a desire for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of final day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in a four-ball game and in a pair tournament, it achieved an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired pair, Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two wins over the undefeated Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the grounds of the Le Golf National to four points.
European side Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, who struggled to return the trophy they lost to the golf club "Hazeltine" two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American side in the morning game with four balls and won the series with 3-1.
The U.S. provided greater resistance to the pair's tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the setback.
The country's Jim Furik must win eight points in 12 matches in a single on Sunday to hold the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then teamed up brilliantly and mastered the pumped Woods and American debutant Brayson Deshambo with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who made his way through two matches on Saturday, was instantly brilliant, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a pair and seven-row tournament.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henry Stanson in a pairing tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cape – the first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not all go according to plan on this pleasant, sweltering day southwest of Paris.
Three-time Majors winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They picked a 2-1 win over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, to later return and beat Puller and Rory McElroy 4-3 in a pairing tournament, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup some teams returned after a four-point deficit ahead of the match's single, although Furik's side, which defends the title, was enough to hold the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days already, the counter-attack on Sunday seems to be above their capabilities.
North Korea says it has “no talk” about unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures to show good will” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear non-nuclear warheads, and decommissioning of nuclear warheads.
“However, there is no adequate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no talk of us being the first to unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints against Washington's "phasic" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement was of importance because he did not oust him as a one-sided scapegoat.
Rye called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950–53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been scrambling for calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States does not give up on ‘denuclearization first of all’ and increases the level of pressure from sanctions to enforce its goal, even opposing the ‘proclamation of the end of the war’,” he said.
“What they think sanctions can put us on our knees is just letting go of the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader had spoken about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "Yes, we are negotiating this problem of denuclearization with South Korea, not with the United States of America.
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech differed dramatically from last year’s, when at the UN General Assembly he said that targeting U.S. land-based missiles by North Korea was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump alone named “Mr. Evil.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for the courage to take steps to disarm, but said that more needs to be done and that sanctions must not be allowed to remain.
Trump said on Wednesday he did not set a time frame for this, saying: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue strictly and without delay to be implemented until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio past the UN General Assembly and after that said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the words that progress had been made, so that North Korea would condemn him after only a few hours for making “gangster demands.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile range, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that they were "appropriate measures" that sought security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard attend a course on how to get enough sleep.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students more sleepy in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night with the help of caffeine”.
One academic noted that university students are the number one in the world who are often unaware of basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of this course was gained after a speech that held about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl finally came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing it now, in the last year of study?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is held for the first time this year, students are provided with a foundation on how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of health services at this university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it has been observed that students suffer from serious malaise during the week.
The one-hour course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the student house and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, slippers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants listen to how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as everyone has the right to know what the consequences of smoking cigarettes are for health,” Professor Chaisler added.
The culture of pride for “sleepless all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the fact that lack of sleep is becoming an ever-increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that of quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, as a result of lack of sleep, the brain transitions into a starvation mode.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chaizler come up with a course, after last year attending one of his lectures during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
The next step, as we hope, would be to ask all post-graduates to undergo a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students think about setting up alarms at bedtime and waking up and take into account the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can interfere with circadian rhythms and thus dowry problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga beat Gerard's team in goal
The Rangers suffered another guest drop when Dolly Menga sent a shot to disarming team Steven Gerard in a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox Stadium tried to take the first win in the guests after a February 4-1 triumph at St. John's, but the team of Gary Holt hired Gerard as manager only a second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team unbeaten in eighth place.
Menga was shot seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' unscathed stance never came close to equalization.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian just because of the difference in the heads.
The Rangers may face additional problems after the line judge Kalum Spence had to seek help due to a head injury after being stabbed on the side by an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Air and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, defined himself for the same eleven Livingston players who took the point to Hartsy last week and would be delighted by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston took better advantage of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to reach the goal just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal with the first pass in the empty space, but the midfielder missed a big chance and shot alongside the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket in a deep free-kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow shot alongside the other team's goalscorer.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their last-line game gave them more hope than faith in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have received a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lowles clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but the former goaltender from Ibrox Stadium, Liam Kelly, without major problems defended the kick against head Lassana Coulibaly and blunted the shot that Ovie Eyaria had directed.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real power ratio during the game, no one can dispute that he was deserved if for nothing else, then due to hard work.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with the deep-played action of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pulled the ball to Castle Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard responded to the break by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block him.
However, Livingston went on to instruct guests to play just as it suits them, with the long balls of Litgow and Halket.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor kept up well and defended the Jacobs attack, to then send Litgo out of the corner of the head with the ball next to the goal.
Glen Middleton, Rangers' replacement, at the end of the game sought another penalty when he stuck with Jacobs, but Thompson did not react again.
Almanac: The Invention of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main pillars of science, the Geiger counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Crown Bell, which featured seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: “What is that to you?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, you can really hear it!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and kill infected cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then inject them again.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer retreated for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so they can "see" the protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzoffsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their "teaching" of how to target cancer cells has been well shown in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined in fierce attacks on Trump's defense, wearing a MAGA-labeled cap, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was drafted into the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an unrelated speech in which he applauded U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for some political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, "Ghost Town", with the "Make America Great" catchphrase, he delivered a harsh speech against the Democrats and again supported Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times with white people who would say to me, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s a racist?’
“If I were to worry about racism, I would have long since moved out of America,” he said.
The SNL show aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blaise Ford's claim to sexual abuse.
Although not aired, comedian Chris Rock has posted a video of West’s brutal speech on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make Vesta laugh with this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scene he had a problem because of the cap he was wearing.
“They got me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that duck."
They threatened me!
And then they say I drowned," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The news continued: “Do you want to see what it looks like?” adding that “will wear Superman’s coat because it means you can’t order me. Do you want a better world?
Then spread the love.”
The audience looked at his fears at least twice, and it seemed as if the members of the SNL show were uncomfortable, Variety reports, while one of the attendees stated for this magazine: “The whole study was dominated by pain.”
At the last minute, the news replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many by his performance of the song "I Love It", masked in a Perrier water bottle.
The news received the support of the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Kendis Turner, who posted the following tweet: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOTHING CONSTITUTED BEFORE THE EVIL.”
However, TV host Karen Hunter wrote in her tweet that West is simply “yours and it’s absolutely beautiful.”
“But my choice is not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts a great ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
The rapper posted on Twitter before the show that he changed his name, stating that he would now "be known sometime as Kanye West".
He is not the first performer to change his name – before him did Didi, also known as Paf Didi, Pafi and Pi Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution for attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place on Ballyhackamore Street, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before a criminal court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will consider the charges.
Star of the series "Game of Thrones", Keith Harington, condemned the disastrous macho culture
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow mutters with a sword in the HBO television series Game of Thrones, which is a medieval fantasy full of violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the hero's macho stereotype, saying that because of such roles on screen, young people often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Keith expressed his view that “something went wrong” and dealt with the question of how to deal with the problem of the destructive macho culture in the #JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married a partner in the "Game of Thrones" series, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she had a "strong need" to talk about the problem.
“I’m currently quite tormented by the question – what did we go wrong with representing masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men who are growing up, related to the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the deadly macho culture because of portraying characters who portray themselves as men.
He added: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets that makes young people think they have to fit in a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main questions of our time – how do we change that?
It’s obvious that something went wrong with the young people.”
In the interview, he admitted that he would not agree to the performances or sequels of the "Game of Thrones" series after the end of her next summer, saying that she "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard’s play True West – a story about the film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently found out that dating his current wife, Rose, is the best thing that has brought him a series of "Game of Thrones".
“In this series I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose starred in Igrit, Kit's love partner John Snow, in this fantastic series that features Emmy recognition.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported an increase of 14%
China has reported a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or a 14 percent thirst.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, which was not previously the case.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through sex is a hot problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China is no longer considered illegal since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative conceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The transmission of the virus often also occurs due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to medicines for HIV as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff had published data on GOP senators, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat has pointed out that these claims are being placed by experts and the “ultra-right wing” website.
“They lie, they lie and they lie even more disgustingly,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mother Lee and Orina Hec, from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Commission hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff — whose identity, personal information, and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims — is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This baseless claim is a totally false and absolute lie.”
A statement by Waters quickly sparked online condemnation, which was also issued by former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
“This demant is going mad,” wrote Flasher.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When he accuses someone of something he didn’t do, he shouldn’t be mad.
We're not gonna be a jerk.
We're not going to question the prosecutor's motive.
He must be calm and calm.”
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to critics of the Democrat to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters' replacement in the midterm election, also announced on Twitter.
“It’s a great thing if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said her office had informed “the appropriate competent institutions and judicial bodies about these false claims,” according to the report.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that before the law they are responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of the film “Johnny English – Again in Action” – a soft satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this sequel to the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny Inglish – which began in 2003 with a sequel to "Johnny's Life" and "Johnny's Life".
Will the ironic autosatria about what we are obviously rubbish be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, bubbly, incompetent Johnny English with a face like that of a tire got a new chance to grab something – with his name more than anything to say that this is a general comic creation designed for the territory of which the mascot is a mascot.
It is, of course, about an archaic secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamor, wears a bit of Cluzoa, the moustache of Mr. Bean and the moustache of that guy who played only one note in the 2012 theme tune of the song "Church of Tears"
It was also originally based on a passenger and mysterious man in an international setting whom Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
In this latest sequel about Johnny Inglish, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny Inglish approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly ring a bell about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather thin and unusually shallow, especially considering that “serious” film brands such as “007” and “Impossible Mission” now regularly include comics.
Humor leaves the impression that it was intended for children, and not for adults, and, in my opinion, John Inglish's twisted misadventures were not as inventive and elaborated to the dance as Atkinson's gays in the style of silent films when he interpreted Bin.
Now it is a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to a decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson has masterfully played this character designed by the model on Theresa May, but the script is rather poor.
Counselors from the intelligence service inform her that all active spies have been compromised and that she will have to hire one of the retired.
It's head and chin twisted Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a canceled institution, but unofficially holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the film.
After an urgent procedure, English returns to Whitehall for instructions and reunites with former patient assistant Baum, who is reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine, in the interpretation of Wiki Pepperdin which is somewhat superfluous.
And so are Batman and Robin incapacitated and incapacitated again in action in the secret service of Her Majesty and luckily beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the villainous Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Bau begin their costume of comical anniversaries: interrupted in the connoisseurs, they set on fire a glittering French restaurant, make chaos swirling on the Voltaire luxury yacht, and Inglish launches a real anarchy trying to get to know the locals by using a squid.
It is obvious that a great deal of effort was put into that last sequence, but no matter how sympathetic and cheerful, the whole movie was as if it were made for children.
It's pretty average quality.
As with other films about Johnny Inglish, I can’t help but wonder: Can the British film industry think of a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to make a plan for the British, according to which they will work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week – and be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company’s executives to pass on the time they save to workers thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an additional day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers’ rights.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “He expects everything to be done by the end of the year to be a more elaborate review of the legislation.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>The old will not be able to go directly to the new one, but the fourth day of the new one is the goal of the new one to be put into the party’s approach to the rebalancing of the new one.
The Labour Party is not the first party to accept such a move, the Green Party is committed to a four-day no-deal with such a campaign for the general election of 2017. <0xD0><0x90><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0> <0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB0>
However, such a longing is not immediately shared by the reading of the Labour Party. . . .
Laburistikke skanke kaje: "The four-day rarity is not given to the right-wing skanke and the skanke is not a rasmatra."
The minister in the Senate, John McDonnell, has used the recent conference of the Labour Party to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution in the future. . . .
Mr. McDonnell stressed the need to turn the tide away from the "innocent directors" and "prophyteers" in the public domain.
The plans of the minister in the shadow of such a situation make sense to the third-party shareholders in the vodsnabdeva<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>i kompanijama may not be able to get their total <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>dub<0xC4><0x9B>o v<0xC4><0x8D>e<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC4><0x9B>
It is also confirmed by the plan of the 500 workers in the previous election of the company and the creation of the Inclusiv Wla<0xC5><0xA1>nice funds, by which it would be 10 per cent of the total number of employees.
Lindsay Greeham and John Kennedy said they would be "60 Minutes" if they could get their heads up about the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
It's the FBI's latest indictment against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and it's been a long time since I've seen it, and it's a long time since I've seen it, and it's a long time since I've seen it.
In an interview broadcast in Nedel, the reporter for the show "60 Minutes" Scott Pley asked the Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsay Gr<0xC3><0xA6>m<0xC3><0xA6>a, whether they would be able to do it.
Kenedy was an opener from his colleague from South Carolina, who was also a member of the group.
"I mean, it's like that," Kennedy said.
“I said to myself, coming to hear us, I said to myself, ‘I’m going to talk to Judge Kavanaugh.’
He called me to ask me what was going on when the charges were filed, and he said, 'Did you hear that?'"
He was very, very, very, very unresponsive."
However, it seems that Greem's glas is embedded in the camen.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and I would not have made it a more egregious accusation," he said.
“I don’t know what Dr. Ford knew, but here’s what I know: Brett’s got all the guts out of it,” Graham said, thinking of Christine Blaze Ford.
“And no one who is that particular person can’t confirm that.
That's 36 yards straight.
I wouldn't say I'm not going to give it all up."

Organisers of the Global Citizen claimed that since 2011, the goodies have paid more than 19 million shares of their supporters of the moderates in order to eliminate a number of sizable targets.
It's hard to believe that these actions will be enough for all the world's leaders to wait until they reach their goals, and we're worth about $37 billion, so that's why we're going to have 20 lives.

It seems, however, that the American people are very much interested in the question of who they believe as a witness to Fordowe and Kavanaugh, with nothing more than those who are with him.
The new investigation is conducted by the JuGov Agency, which is expected to provide 41 per cent of the respondents with a definitive or verifiable verification of the testimony of Fordowe, up to 35 per cent of the respondents.
Along with that, 38 percent of them have the right to see if Kavano Verovatno or definitively lied in his testimony, even though 30 percent of them think the same about Ford.
Fleejk's insistence is that the FBI is immediately investigating the charges that have been brought against Ford, as well as another person, Deborra Ramirez, was reported by Gardijan.

The inventor of the world wide web (World Wide Web) is planning to create a new intrenet as he would have objected to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is a start-up startup whose goal is to defeat Facebook, Amazon, and Google in the next round.
The most recent project in this field, "Inrupt", was the company's first venture to be built on the Berners-Lee platform, which was opened by Soli<0xC3><0xA8>res-Code.
It is possible for a solid user to choose a place where all their feet will be torn apart, and who will be able to access the information that is being provided.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Companies magazine, Berners-Lee was asked to name a number of things that were hidden behind the proposed Inrupt "World Dominance" project.
"We've got to get out of here," said the old man.
"This is a historic trench."
The application of the fundamentals of Solid technology to prevent people from creating their own “personal right to the on-the-shelf shards of p<0xC5><0x8D>dataka”, or POD.
It may contain a list of accounts, a list of zadataka, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional alatkas.
This is because Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are equally accessible in a single browser.
What's unique about the personal privacy of the on-the-spot locksmith is that what's excluded from the server depends on who's able to access the information that's available to them.
The company says it will “resurrect you personally across the foothills.”
The idea for Inrupt, as General Manager John Bruce has it, is that the company will be able to provide resources, processes, and deliver everything as soon as possible, so that we can do what we want to do.
The company is located in B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-Ley, Brusa, B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-B<0xC3><0xA4>rners, B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners, B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners, B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners, B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-B<0xC3><0xB6>rners-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-Bers-B
I have come from all over the world to make it possible for me to create a common decentralized application with the help of the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about it, so they don't always have a full understanding of what's going to happen to them.
“Don’t let the devil get away from you.”
In an announcement from the media's platform, Berners-Lee wrote to Inrupt "the name of the mission to provide commercial energy, and the only source of energy will be the one that will be able to do so.
Berners-Lee's 1994 Good Transformed Internship was established by the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts, where he worked as a director.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was eaten by the influential glaucoma in the debate about the neutrality of the internees.
As a launcher of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Institute of Open Source Data.
“I’m a bit optimistic about this new era of hate,” Berners-Lee said.
BERNARD VAN: I would like to pay tribute to a priest of the First World Order, the nosioc of the Victorious Cross
The only witness to the Church of England is the widowed Victoria's cross as a boat for the time of the First World War, she's going to be buried in her grave at 100 o'clock in the morning.
The posthumously wealthy Bernard Vaughan served in this post on September 29, 1918, on the occasion of the Nappada Code of Belangliza and Leeokura.
However, four days later, he killed a sniper, and he never realized that he was going to attack the most high-ranking British soldier in the war.
His two children in the basement were exposed to a spomen-placho so far in Rashdeen, Northumptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that he was "brilliantly symbolic" because he had discovered that there were only 100 goodies he had ever made in his life, and that he was the only one he had ever seen.
On September 29, 1918, the Good Lord of Londron's Gazettes, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Van, took his battalion directly to the canal of Saint-Quentin's "beyond the thick, thick fog."
He then rushed to the next line and, with the "new youth", he advanced up to the top of the hill, which was almost entirely up to the artillery's device, and escaped from the ranks of the three sections.
Vana was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, at the end of the day, so that he could not go beyond the moon's edge.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said that his parents' excuses were "because I know what I know and I would never be able to answer it, but there's nothing to call it like that."
He and his brother-in-law, Dr. James Van, were thus pursued by a venerable man named P<0xC3><0xA1>rade Koy, who was led by the Imperial Omladin Orchestre of Brentwood.
Michael Vaughn said that he was "a witness to what he had done in the parade" and that he was "a witness of the true hero of the demon-streaked mob." and that he was "a witness of the true hero of the demon-streaked mob."
The MMA's fans stayed up all night to watch Belathor 206, and instead they beat Peppa Prasse.
You'd think you'd stay awake all night long, and you'd think you'd miss Belathor 206, and you'd be powerless to miss a silly joke.
Doga<0xC4><0x91>aj in San Jose included 13 borbs, including six in a silly plot and in the UK he was lured to live on the n<0xC3><0xB3>ch na kanal 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musassi and Rory Macdonald were preparing to face each other, the guards in the U.K. were left to be locked up when they were preparing to leave for Peppu.
They didn't know what to expect when they woke up the next morning because they were so excited about it, but they didn't know what to expect.
The only person who has ever been married is a person who has not been able to write a children’s cartoon on Twitter described it as “some kind of a better shawl.”
"According to the regulations, at six o'clock in the morning it was not appropriate, but they had to be careful not to go to the children's room," said Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president.
"'Pepa Prase', da."
The chairman of the company, Belathor Scott Cooker, said that he would advise us on his pro-German scheme as to how to incorporate the UK's gladeoces in the future.
“I think it’s all about reprize, I think we’re going to probably be able to do it and we’re going to be happy,” Cooker said.
“But it’s almost six o’clock in the morning in the afternoon, and we can’t afford to sit down at the end of the day, at the end of the day, at the end of the night, at the end of the night.
But let's do that.
Trust me, when he's gone all the way, he's got a lot of wigs and they're not all billies friendly.
We've been trying to get it together, thinking we've got it in the question of technical concussion.
But it wasn't a bill, it was a challenge.
I can promise you that you won't have to do it the next time.
We're going to keep all five of us in place six—as usual, and on a regular basis—we've been trying to convince each other that we're going to be able to provide more than usual, and we're going to be able to do that.
There's an unfortunate situation in the question."
Décert <0xC3><0xA0> l'alend discs: Tom Deyley has been "inferior" about sex
Olympic rower Tom Daley has been able to increase his sense of inferiority in the back of us due to his sexual prowess – but that’s because of his motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old boy, who was no longer in high school, did not understand that he was “not all like him.”
In the first issue of Radio 4's Razgowor, D<0xC3><0xB6>zert ajlend discs with conductor Loreen Lavern, he said that he was going to give a govw<0xC3><0xB3>rio about gay rights as he would otherwise.
He also said he was less concerned about the Olympic bid, and so on, the scheduler was released.
The rare director of the long-running show, Kirsty Jang, took her in for a few months of absence for the sake of ill health.
Despite the impression of being cut off in the first issue of Lavernove, Deyly said that he had cut himself "less valuable" than the rest of the time, because "it was no longer necessary to do so."
He said: "To-day, so cut off for me to think of myself and for others, these are the bells of the wind, who have kept my strength and the snow for me to succeed."
He wanted to make sure it was "nothing and nothing", he said, as if he hadn't given up on everything he wanted to make us realize that he was having sex with him.

If he did, he would have done so, because he felt happy that he was able to live in the open, without a trace, and therefore what he wanted to give to others in order to “do it.”

“When he came across so much of it, he was in such a bad mood” – the first Olympiad he left for 14 years, and his father died of it three years later – when he was born.
Their two daughters were released to the randitele in June, they beat the son of Robert Reig Blake-Daily, and Daley gave him all the "reading perspektive" pronouns.
“If they had asked me about the past, I would have said, ‘I’m going to have to buy a gold medal,’” he said.
“But they will know more, less and more important creatures from the golden olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden olympic medalist."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert Koyy, died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was discovered to have a brain tumor.
He said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether he already had a card for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He was going to be in London for the first time.
“I couldn’t have said, ‘Dad, you’re not going to live to be in the first place,’” he said.
“I held out my hand when he was ready to breathe, and as soon as he was ready to breathe and died, I felt as if I hadn’t been able to breathe,” he said.
The next day, Mrs. Deyley won the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I’ve known for a while that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life – that I’m going to fuck in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, but don’t let the pain go away,” he said.
This section was also inspired by his selection of the first song "Praud" by Heder Smol, which was resonated with him in the prelims for the Olympics and from which he went on to play.

Michaelson's farewell from the formal stand-up at the club for the submarine Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will release a record in no time when he would have raised his 47th match to the Ryder Cup, but he will have to wait until he gets in the form of a knockout knockout.
Michaelson, who for the 12th time is participating in this two-year-old team, Captain Jim Furick has been invited to the club for a sub-game with four different options and games.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as if it were so often in Sedinjen<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B> Dr<0xC5><0xBE>avam, the five-time champ will be led by the likes of a navigator and the like.
Since the peak of our career has not been more precise in the long term, this 48-year-old has not been able to go to the candidacy for a short term "Le golf nasion", the long term "Le golf nasion".
And since it's not enough for me to be obeschrabrowu<0xC4><0x87>, Michaelson is in the second match in the final of the match with the British champ Fiancé's Fiancé's Moulins.
As Americans, who are four points ahead of the 12-point mark, they're going to have a tough start, and Michaelson's game would be absolutely impossible if he didn't make it.
Furik insisted that the name should be placed in his own pocket, and that he could not say the same thing to anyone else.
“He understood the role of who he was playing in the underworld today, he tapped me in the cold, he hugged me, and he said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furick said.
“I’ve got a lot of self-doubt.
His name is in the Dvoran of the Slavs, and he has done so much to these teams in the past, and in this place too.
I don't think he's going to play two games, though.
He was planning on going higher, but that's how it worked out, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wanted to be as much, as much, as he wanted to be like the others."
Michaelson will defend Nick Faldo's record for the highest-grossing matches ever played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of a career in a Ryder buy that has never been able to reach the height of his personal rékord<0xC3><0xB3>n.
Michaelson had 18 assists, 20 assists, and six assists, but Furyk didn't want him to be present in the team.
“He’s obnoxious, sarcastic, spiritual, even if he laughs at people, and it’s hard to have him in the team roster,” he explained.
“I think that the younger players have enjoyed the opportunity to take a chance, and this is not the place to go, which was a hell of a dream.
He's giving me a lot more than the game itself."

So, the story's going to pick up both me and everyone on that team, and that's not the end of it.
Tomorrow we're going full steam ahead.
Let's get out of here and sort out all the fuss.
There's nothing that's been done that hasn't been done to us.
We have a goal, and it's an attempt to win this trophy, and we're going to stay focused.
“I’m still here, and I’m focusing on 12 players from all over the world, but as we all know, we’re all on the same page – the best players in the world,” he said.
Delighted by the game of his players playing golf on the ground, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore that was all about it.
Tomorrow's not going to be any different.
In the morning, the individual player will be rewarded by the player, and he will want to play another game.
It's nice to be there when you're a quarterback, when you're a quarterback, but when you're there, there's a lot of golfer's capacitance.
It's a wig-of-the-mill mooring game, pulling the bats out of its way tomorrow.
He's going to keep his partner behind him, and he's going to come out and get everything out of him."
For the character of Bjorn, the captain of the rival team Jim Furyk will chase from his players the pain of one-on-one action from one of the coyotes were carried out by the four-tenths of the team, the exception of the four-tenths.
And Furik himself was on the sidelines of those great preokretts in the aftermath, the first to give the winning team to Brooklyn, and then to the loser when "the European team is here".
“I remember everything literally speaking to you,” he asked us, as Ben Cranescho, the captain of the 1999 Godine, had been raising the morale of his players since the start of the game.
“The next morning we had 12 important matches, but it would be nice if we had a quick start like the one we saw in Brooklyn and the one we saw in the Medina.
As soon as he knew what was going on in a row, a great deal of pressure was exerted on the center of the match.
We're going straight to our post, and we're going to do what we think we're going to do, you know, we're trying to do a little bit of the magic of tomorrow."
Thomas went on to say that he was trying to move forward and to face Rory McIlroy in the final match, along with Paul Keissie, Justin Russie, John Ealy, and Ram.
“I started with this group of moms in that corner because I think we’re so guilty about it,” Bjorn said, referring to his selection for the week-end.
We're going to have to wait for the German ship to come to us.

Plovdiv was to join the Mornarics in 2014, but the problems of the nakon izporuke paved the way for the future of this ambitious project.
The four layers of the Baden-Wirtemberg clade that the Morn<0xC3><0xA1>rics had commissioned in 2007 will be replaced by the fregatte clade Bremén.

Other important caracteristics include longer periods of time without being able to hold on – it would be necessary to be able to make it seem as if it had been going on for more than two years.
However, there will always be more and more people who know how to do it, and who cares about it, and who cares about it, and who cares about it, and who cares about it, and who cares about it, and who cares about it.

This was the first time that Mornarica's boatyard had been wrecked by a ship that had been unloaded.
Little is known about the rhazlozim for a long time, but the German media have brought us more crucial "defekata n'a software and hardveru" which would have been a very good thing for us.
The software shortages were clearly important, because the plovilimma klasse Baden-Wirtemberg would have been able to get rid of about 120 mornara – so much so that it would have gone mad.
Thus, it has become clear that the vessel's weight is a drastic pre-ordained vessel, so that it may be replaced by a performanence, and that it may have warmed the power of the Morn<0xC3><0xA1>rice to the extent that it is possible.
The view is that the Rhineland-Palatinate is only 7,000 tons twice as much from a ship's similar class as the Germans had described in the Second World War. . . .

Earlier in the day, Hans-Peter Barttels, the chief of staff to be selected in the German port of Parlament, confirmed to the Mornarics that the "services of the ship" had been carried out.
This bell tower has insisted that in the course of time the bells are more serious and serious, because the boats are raschodovanized without the introduction of the zammen's rafts.

National Fund Listens to the Secret Lives of Blind Mice <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In this experience, those who have given us a single name in Scotland have a higher name for the purpose of discovering how the dormant mice of the Koriste geografske distant land in the back of the mountain.
The expatriates will continue to look forward to seeing the light of these unique summer sisars and, in a way, the direction of their future activities in order to be able to do so. . . .
The experience of scientists from the National Fund for Scotland will be the most common and the most painful of the sleepy muscles, as well as the long-haired long-haired owl and the watery owl owl.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Post-recording edits will be made available to key locations across the property in order to capture the activity of blind mice in such a way that they will be able to see it.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of <0xC5><0xA0>kotskie (NHS) will also carry out a mobile examination of the hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequences of the glassos of the blind mice and what the species is doing.
Then there will be a detailed map of the stations with a description as if they were a full picture of their poona<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ana in the back of the ground.
Rob Dhuar, a conservation consultant who came to the Fund, will not be able to find out which areas of the station are the most common for sleeping mice, and we will be able to find out what they are like.
These informations will contribute to the strengthening of the predominance of the construction of the station as well as to the creation of the livada, as well as to the way in which all the others have been able to do so.
The brevity of the blind mice in Scotland and across the UK has been slanted in the past few years.
They're being handed over to the town halls and the raison d'<0xC3><0xAA>tres, and they're affecting our anger and the loss of the station.

“There’s a lot of people out there in the middle of the night,” he said.
"We've got old townhouses, plenty of old trees, and a lot of stalls all over the place.
But I'm still not aware of the blind thoughts, and I'm going to do it here, and I'm going to do it with other things, so I'm going to give them a better sense of what they're doing."
It is important to note the importance of the presence of blind mice in order to lead to the survival of the brain, as it is a result of the accidental destruction of one of the slums of the brain and of the brain.
The blind mice are shielded, and the object is to kill them, torture them, or upset them, and destroy their incestuousness. . . .
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Fund for the Protection of Blind Mice, encourages the public to engage and to give their doprinoos to the public.
She says: “And we still need to learn more about our blind minds, and we still don’t know how we’re going to be able to learn about our blind minds, and we’re going to be able to learn more about our species, and we still don’t know how we’re going to be able to do that.”
Ronaldo dismissed the accusations of rape, adding to the appeal against the German newspaper's "Chasopist" (German newspaper).
Christiano Ronaldo described the charges against him for raping him as "bad news", saying that he wanted people to "give themselves a reason" by chanting his own name.

The father of Juventus and Portugal is accused of forcing the American woman by the name of Catherine Majorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in the summer of 2009.
The next day, she was paid 375,000 dollars, as if she hadn't told her about the incident, Spiegel reported it to the police.
By recalling all 142 million of his followers in "Instagram Lajv", he saw a number of public accusations, and Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the statements as "false", saying that he was "false".
“No, no, no, no, no.
That's what they said today, you're wrong," said the five-time Golden Globe Award winner in the camera.
“They want me to tell them my name, and they want me to tell them my name.
That's normal.
He wants to give me a piece of junk so he can spell out my names, but that's what he's doing.
I am a happy man and everything is in order,” said the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's suggestion was to admit that Spiegel was wrong to anyone who had described him as "unacceptable to say that he was suspicious of the obliviousness of the attraction", he said.
Advokat Christian Shertz said that the footballer will be afraid of the "moral shield in the outskirt of the odgovara t<0xC4><0x9B>g<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>i <0xC4><0x8D>rek<0xC5><0xA1>a, koj verov<0xC4><0x8D>na <0xC4><0x8D>e<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC4><0x9B> <0xC4><0x8D>e<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a<0xC4><0x8D>a
The incident occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in a motel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas, California, United States.
Nakon satanka in a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga were all returned to the player's room the next day, where he was forced to go to the next day, directly to the court of the District Court of the District.
Majorga claims that Ronaldinho has been the victim of a recent incident and that he claims that he is "99 percent good-for-nothing" but that he has let go of those "one hundred percent".
In the documentime it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had a couple of sexes, but that he knew it in a good way.
Majorga claims that she went to the police with the photografiam of her cousins in the hospital, but that she later accepted the vansudsk nagodbu because she was a swedish swedish swedish swedish swedish
This 34-year-old woman is not going to want to quit her job because she still has a lot of traumas because of the next incident.
At the time, Ronaldo was in a position to make a comeback in Real Madrid from Manchester, and this summer he has spent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million on the Italian side of the road.
Bregzit: UK "would never risk" the loss of a car's driver
The U.K. would “never hesitate” if Bregzitta lost the status of a world leader in a self-driving car, as the minister added to Greg Klark.
He said that he would be "concerned" about what Toyota UK said to B-B-Sy that in the case of Britain, he would leave the EU without any spores, and that he would be obsessingly obsessing about the situation in B-Sy.
"I'm sorry, I've got a spore mind," Klark said.
The Japanese automaker's director of automobiles has said that in the case of Bregzitta, the loss of a few seats would have been caused by the loss of a few seats.
The factory in Bernaston – which is the result of this auris and avensis – has produced more than 150,000 cars of goodies, of which 90% has been exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My concern is that we will have a resounding surge in the factory as Britain, by the end of the march, comes out of the EU,” said Marvin Cook, director of the Toyotene factory in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about the EU’s failure to stagnate without any comprehension about the functioning of the vehicle.
Be-Em-We, for example, would like to know how Bregzit will be able to set up his own factory of the Minnie brand in Oxford for a month.
The main reasons for the concern are that we do not have the risks to be aware of in the case of Bregzitha without the need to slow down, i.e., the drivers of automobilization.
The Tojotin water line works on the principle of "exactly in time", where the parts for the given cars arrive at a 37-minute distance from the operators from the UK and the EU.
As the UK let the EU slow down on the 29th of March, they can go to the border because the leaders of the industry are doing what they can to make it easier to get to the bottom of the river and not enough.

Trump's sitting with Rozenstaijn will be able to be ousted, cajoling at the White House.
It is important to note that Donald Trump is not a member of the House of Representatives, but a member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Rodom Rozenstaajn, may be "a member of the House of Representatives for another term."

He asked whether Trump would remove the deputy chief of staff or not, and that would aggravate Maler's incompetence, but he's been on the run for months now, and he's been in trouble.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstajn razgov<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD>a about the hearing aid's ability to record razgov<0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xA1>a s<0xC3><0xA1> Tr<0xC3><0xA1>mp<0xC3><0xB3>m and m<0xC3><0xB3>g<0xC3><0xB3>v<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD>a
Rosenstein's been out of the way.
But as soon as he had gone to the White House, he went to the White House, despite the fact that he was preparing to leave.
Instead of that, like Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York City, it's a great Thursday, and it's a great day.
Trump has said that he would not be "new" to say that he would be "supposed" to be "supposed" to be, but that he would be "supposed" to be "supposed" to be "supposed" to be "supposedly" to be heard.
On Friday, Trump blamed a one-week FBI shooting for a string of charges against Kavanaugh, long-awaited to prolong the ghastly silence of the entire Senate.
Trump's president of the U.S., Sarah Sanders, has been announcing the Fox News channel in the near future.
Asked about Rosenstein, she said: “It’s not yet a date, it might have been somewhere, it might have been somewhere else, it might have been somewhere else, it might have been a long time, it might have been a long time.
But I'll see, and I'll always try to push the wrong button to the wrong side of things."
Some reporters might argue that Sanders' claim: Since September 10th, Sanders's has not held a general meeting for the stamp at the White House.
Chris Wallace, the leader, was asking for something in return.
Sandersov's rule of law is that the state of affairs is not a candidate for the defense of the right wing of the neo-winner's wish for a "catcher's tail", but it is a rule of law: "I would not choose to do so."
Then it's a good idea to boost the direct contact between Trump and the neo-Vin<0xC3><0xA1>ra.
“The president has a higher confrereence in the committee, and he asks us if there’s another president in front of him,” she said, not giving us the words: “Privately, you’re right.”
And I will continue to be a member of the General Assembly, she said to Sanders, but “as soon as we have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is not possible to do so.
We've been working hard to make it work, and we've seen it happen, and we've been doing it for so long, and we've been doing it for so long, and we've been doing it for so long."
Trump rarely asks us a question on the occasion of a break from the White House or when he is participating in an open meeting of the House of Commons or in a New York-based conference with a guest speaker.
The self-conferences of the pump are rigged.
The president here in New York City may have been pok<0xC3><0xA1>zao and sk<0xC3><0xA1>go, being in front of the assembled neo-Vin<0xC4><0x81>rima, he had been p<0xC3><0xB3>na<0xC5><0xA1>antno, and we were both present and in good shape.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to EU workers in the National Health Service of Skotske with a view to the escalating defeat of Bregzit by the Bregzit
The Minister of Health has written to the people of the EU who are working in the National Health Service of Skotskie as it would have been possible to raise awareness of all the land and to call them to do so.
Scotland's Ambassador to the UK, Jean Freeman, has sent a letter in the form of a letter to the EU's Foreign Office (UK) for a period of less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the costs of the applications that have been submitted for the benefit of the EU citizen, who has been working in its long-term public service, in the past.
Freemanova wrote in her letter: “Progressors about the departure of the UK from the EU have been planning such a summer, going to the expected end of the autumn.
But the U.K.'s government is doing this to get us to make a viable scenario without the advent of the spore mind.
I know it's definitely gonna be a bothersome time for all of you.
So I'd like to give you a little bit of a price to pay for every single person I've ever met, without regard to the nation's national identity.
As a result of the important parts of the EU, as well as the wider ones, we have a lot of experience and skills that we are able to develop and promote in the way of healthy service, in the service of our customers, and in the service of our customers.

The head coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, said he was a repoorterym, and that he was too stupid to come up with anything that wasn't exactly half-assed.
“He came down the line, and he just walked in there,” Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff put Abercrombie's oxygen in the car before they put him in a noose, and they put him back in a further test.
A caller from Tennessee said Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was transported to the Vanderbilt Medical Center to see if he was being operated on.
Harris went on to say, “I still don’t have any details about the species/seriousness of the trout,” and that Tenesy’s attempt to find out when it came to the trout.

Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.” <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Sanderlend's boss, Jack Ross, has said it's his "end of ambition" and in no way has been the late manager of the Scottish re-election campaign.
Forty-two-year-old Skot lives up to the challenge of reviving the club's all-rounder, he's kicked us in the third place of the first league, three points from the top.
This summer he moved to Stadion Svetlosti nak<0xC3><0xB3>n, where St. Miren spent his time in the Scottish Premiership of the League of the Seasons.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I was alone in the B-team re-presentation and that's it," Ross said on the SPORTSAUND show in Scotland's B-B-Sijou.
“But I was so angry that I looked at Scotland and Hempden with my father that I was so small, and he knew nothing about why I was always coming back to him.
However, such an opportunity would have provided itself only if I had succeeded in leading the club.”
R<0xC3><0xB3>sov's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dicka Advokata, David Mojiza, Sem<0xC3><0xA1> Alérdajs<0xC3><0xA1>, Martina O'Nila, Roja Kin<0xC3><0xA1>, Ga<0xC3><0xA7>a Pojeta and Paola.
The former boss of Aloa atl<0xC3><0xA6>tik<0xC3><0xA1> k<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>e d<0xC3><0xA1>a did not run because of the fact that there are so many great names in such a big club, there are so many things that have been taken away from Barneslija and Ypres.
“Merillo’s success at this point will be in the dark: ‘Will I be able to return this club to the Premier League?’
“As a result of the structure and capabilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not easy for me to prove it to you, but I think I'll be able to see how successful I can be if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ross is only in the third year of his career as a manager, so he has been promoted to the rank of Chief Constable in Dambarton and 15 months of being promoted to the rank of coach in the <0xC3><0x96>rebro.
Then he was able to defeat Aloa from the bottom of the third division, and St. Miren took him from the sides of the bottom of the league to the bottom of the league by the winner of the championate.
Ross didn't seem to notice that he had never been able to play so much as a career in Cluj-Napoca, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's, and Hamilton academics.
“It was probably a real crossover,” he said, noting the resumption of Aloa’s club.
"I'm pretty sure that's the real deal for me, but I don't think it's a game anymore.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I was just making fun of myself from there, and I was enjoying myself in no real success at all.
But the game knows it's going to be tough.
I've got a lot of things going on around here that I'm going to have to try and get rid of.
And I'm still going through that in terms of stress and pressure, but I'm going through this one-on-one with the management of it.
I've always wanted to be a leader, and I've always wanted to do that, and I've never felt that way in my whole life, in my whole life, I've never felt so much worse."

It's like a child's name is a secret because of our society's hatred of the people who hide from their parents.
How many children – from whom there is no property until 11 years old – have a secret identity beyond our society’s borders, which lies hidden from their relatives and interrogators, discovers the survival of the human race.
The study, which was carried out by about 20,000 students of higher education, revealed a hole in the "false Insta" slums in the village of <0xC5><0xBD>a<0xC5><0xBE>reda.

As a child, I don’t have any property until 11 o’clock in the morning, and I’m afraid that we’ll be able to hide from those who have lost their lives.
The study, which was carried out by 20,000 students of higher education, revealed a plethora of “fake Instas” – all of which have been revealed to us since the beginning of the year.
These news stories have been furthering the fear of the publication of the sexual content of sex.

Aly Doyle will be the "glas of athletics" in Scotland's athletics selection
Aly Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as the non-executive director of this year's General Meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
The doll is the most rewarding of Scotland's athletics, and the chairman, Ian Bety, described this as a great opportunity for them to be able to get a kick out of the scoundrel and out of the way.
“Eyly is enjoying a lot of fun in Scotland, UK and all over the world, and we’re sure that the Athletics in Scotland will have a huge amount of fun in it,” he said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the glas of the Atleticos, and I'm not going to be able to do anything to give you the doprinos and the reintroduction of the skirmish in Scotland."

The demand for a pump for the extraction of milk in which all the mothers are able to get rid of the cows has led to the idea of an internal one.

The four swans dance in a rock with a shadow and a crow with a song whose lyrics say, “Yes, I’m a muse but I don’t have a rope” and “You may not have noticed, but you don’t.
Refren says to us: “Pump, pump, feed your baby, pump, pump, museum of your own.”
However, the order of the pages of the company on Facebook, which was published, called for the counter-expression of the Internet.
With 77,000 followers and hundreds of commentators, he has seen the emergence of the complex reactions of gledalacs, even though many have said so to change the "worse" of the milk industry.
"The use of the cow for the purpose of reclamation of this transubstantiation was, in fact, a lot of rubbish.
Like us, he would have given the poor and the poor, and he would have given them milk to drink, but he would have given them no more than the days after his birth," he wrote.

Another commented: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
"But why don't you use a pump for the same amount of water that you can use to keep your baby from getting wet?"
He said, "It's a very inconceivable rule."
Others were standing on the side of the pond, and one woman confessed that she had a song called "Urnebesna".
“I think it’s going to be brilliant.
And I'd love to see it if I could still do it.
Because of the pump, I felt like you were like a cow to me.
Reklama's a bit of a joke, but it's kind of creepy to me.
“It’s a brilliant story,” he wrote, without hesitation.

In the end, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps hidden in their chest sniffles.
The konzept reklame is designed to give us a sense of what it is like to be a mother who sucks milk from milk to be able to feel it like a cow.
However, Elvie's pump is completely imperceptible, we don't live in the tub and stand in the chest for the girls, what women do when they move around, keep their babies out of the way, and so on.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at the Mother Company, is quoted as saying: “Pumpa Elvie is so much a revolutionary, she’s so much more than she deserves to be, and she’s so good at it.
By drawing a parallel between squeezing in women and cow breast we wanted to highlight in the foreground the squeezing and challenges she carries with her, as well as to present an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and with which women can share.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has reached the headlines of the press.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the runway for designer Martha Jakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a temporary camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the sharp rhetoric and policies that the Trump administration has introduced to make it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
As a rule, sponsors were mostly and themselves illegal immigrants without documents and fear that they would threaten their own ability to remain in the country if they stepped in and sought a child.
The risk was raised in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to deliver fingerprints, as well as that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs police official, confirmed last week before Congress that the agency had arrested more than a dozen people who had applied for sponsorship of minors without age.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who were sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminally persecuted foreigners.
That's why we're still chasing those people," Mr Albens said.
According to the workers in the shelter, in order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Most will use a conference video instead of a personal presence to submit a claim for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent falls or attempts to escape, according to workers in the shelter and reports from the system over the previous months.
Representatives say concern about this has been raised in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where signs that a child is suffering can be easily overlooked due to size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement by not giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or apologize from friends can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "be like that."
“They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said in front of the assembly.
Mualem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while more than a million have left their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “lead its world battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “a total illegal foreign presence.”
The United States in Syria has about 2,000 troops, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said there were satisfactory conditions for them to return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" as a result of which refugees remain out of the country.
“We have sent an invitation to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with their return,” he said.
“A true policy of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not get aid for reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition that will end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to put a vacuum zone in the last major insurgency in Idlib has led to the creation of the possibility of further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement drew attention to a large-scale attack by Syrian forces enjoying Russia’s support in the region where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the aim of military actions will be jihadists along with fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to al-Qaeda, who will “be uprooted.”
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition will soon be held with the aim of convening a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of that panel should be limited to the review of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of the interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump could win the 2020 re-election unless, like a large number of liberals, the accusations and scandals likely do not end his reign before then.
In something that would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic last episode of a presidential career in history!”
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
The viewership in the hit term has more than doubled since 2014 reaching 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled with 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million viewers in the hit term, which is more than 1.7 million as they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "Show Rachel Meadow" network holds the top spot on cable TVs with up to 3.5 million views.
“It’s a verse in which people are drawn because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Ber, executive producer of the ABC series “Executive Officer,” which talks about the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after the destruction of the Capitol in the attack.
Neal Skwell, an experienced comedy screenwriter and author of "Just Fun Parts: And a Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Ms. Skwell says he answered her, “Because she makes me laugh.”
Chaos in itself also contains the value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the plots coming from Washington could determine the future of women’s rights to the abortion decision, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and the state of the global economy.
Excluding the program is a luxury that only the most empowered viewers can afford.

“I thought they were joking, but they seemed to be right.”

The influx of external money in the midst of the tension of the race for early elections in the Presidential House
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving inflows of money, thanks to the redevelopment of congressional districts, where two deputies fight for the same seat.
So recently came out Conor Lamb, a Democrat from Pittsburgh's suburban district, who won a seat in the second district in last spring's special election.
Lamb is in a race with another MP, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who cleverly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally installed the election results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th launched competition for campaign funding among the party's biggest financiers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Board (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Board (NRCC).
Lamba was read out in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely contested March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the election by 20 points.
Political connoisseurs have given Trump a slight advantage.
The U.S. Considered Penalizing Salvador for Supporting China, So Withdrawn
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with objections from Washington.
Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners moved the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to call off U.S. representatives of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Noert, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.
However, the penalties only applied to Salvador, who in 2017 received U.S. aid in the estimated amount of $140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
Sentenced punitive measures, which include cutting off financial aid and targeted visa regime restrictions, would be hard to fire at a Central American state that already has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to mark a similar rally last year that they considered a step forward in efforts to step up their migration efforts.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and put an end to all issues surrounding the criminalization of Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would address the conference, the new term of which is mid-October, indicating the importance that the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new sharp messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal issues on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable thing is likely to be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is already significant evidence in public sources.
Mueller is reportedly launching an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was in touch with Russia in connection with the election attacks.
If the administration of Congress were to go to other hands, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he prepares to come out again in front of voters, and possibly in front of the court of colleagues.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable – as well as the defeat of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, that the West was able to resist and deter the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have not succeeded in this, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the massacre that followed in the following years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the tireless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are now faced with a few such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unprotected stupor since the paper announced that he had proposed last year to covertly record the president and comment on his inadequacy of the function.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is incorrect.
“How can we react when Brett Cavan’s newly launched investigation into the EFB is neither complete nor fair, or if he receives approval from the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for a Congress that Trump considers reliable?
If we fall on these exams, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall due to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewry, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.

Graham Dorans from Rangers optimistic ahead of a meeting with Rapid Wine
The Rangers are expecting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive equal result with Villareal in Spain earlier this month, would have brought a strong position for qualifying from the Group of the League of Europe.
Graham Doran, a midfield player, could not appear in the season to equalise 2-2 with Villareal due to a knee injury, but believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Villareal is in a better position,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the confidence that we could get something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could get them in the end, but taking everything into account, the equal result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we went back in the second and took the lead.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a great result from the last match. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure we can catch up and get a positive result.
“Last year was very difficult, with everything that happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy, the workouts are good.
We hope that now we can catch up, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Women who are briganded for saving for retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few of them talked about it with their families.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to children about it.
“People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if you don’t get to know them in advance enough.
Together with your counselor and family, decide where and how you want to get care because these are the choices that smartly affect costs.
Include a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include the usual life insurance policies for permanent care, a hybrid life insurance policy that involves money and value to cover expenses, or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have one.
Disclose your legal documentation: Warn the court of disputes.
Take a health care assistant to have a trusted person you can trust to run a medical care account with and that health care workers are familiar with your wishes in the event that you are unable to self-explain.
Also, consider giving the authority to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and take into account that the bills will be paid on time if you are not able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent gets into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to give answers to questions about medications and allergies?
Write out these details in writing so you’re ready.
“Not only are finances at stake, but also questions like who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
“What medications do you use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan for all of this.”
A man was shot several times by an air rifle in Ilfracom
The man was shot several times by an air rifle while returning home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the part of Ilfracom in Devon called Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in British summer time, as a “sudden act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have directed a request for witnesses to call.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have lost their lives in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, and the number of victims is expected to rise, according to official sources.
Due to broken ties, emergency officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongale regent, an area north of Palua that was closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palua after the crash.
Here are the most important facts about Palou and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 from 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the Sulawesi Island coastline.
The regency, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated half-live of 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies largely on fishing and livestock, especially in the coastal area of Dongale.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in the Morovali area, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have experienced multiple tsunami impacts over the past 100 years, according to a report by Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In a 1938 tsunami in Dongali, more than 200 people lost their lives, and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Tsunami hit West Dongal again in 1996 when he took nine victims.
Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of earthquakes.
These are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the western coast of the Indonesian province of A<0xC4><0x87>e in the northern part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half an ocean floor.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have lost their lives on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that crashed on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Zaparna Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the island of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of as much as 10 meters in which more than a dozen villages were destroyed and about 300 lives were lost.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the Pidija regent in A<0xC4><0x87>ehu, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily without shelter.
The eldest son of Sarah Paylin has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Paylin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, has been arrested on charges of mistreatment.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, twenty-nine-year-old Peilin from Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Paylin was detained in Mats prison and was given a $500 bail, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reports.
Peylin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could receive a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offence punishable by a day in jail and a fine of US$2000.
This is not the first time that a criminal complaint has been filed against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for the veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of criminal activity and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have punched her in the face with a song.
Sarah Peilin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP) that arose as a result of the war in Iraq.
Tsunami Caused by Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications have been disrupted, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
According to social networks, videos that show the moment of impact are circulated.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifula Saipov, a New York-based suspect of a terrorist attack that has killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the Home Depot rented truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October and tow pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip had "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
According to the court document, both points carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal high-profile crackdown lifted charges against Saip's 22 defendants, which included eight counts of murder with racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and incitement.
The attack called for “substantial planning and preconceivedness,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as “disgusted, vicious and corrupt.”
"Sajfulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lor Dicat, Derena Drake, Ariel Erliy, Herna Ferouja, Herna Uleg<0xC3><0xA1>
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since New York’s Southern District last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the married couple were executed after they were convicted of plotting to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War of two years.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saypov, who originated in Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they were doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was prompted by video footage of ISIS on the phone to carry out the attack.
Police said they had also asked for the Isis flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He said it was not the fault of the 22-point defendant.
David Peton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipps, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting the confession of guilt with a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all who are involved,” Peton said.
Saip’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party’s parliament has said that the biggest party should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today during a protest at a Conservative Party conference that he would “mobilize the people’s army.”
A former UCIP leader said politicians should face Euroscepticism – as one member of parliament, Teresa May, proposed, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-up MP Peter Bowen told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would “already come out” that Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Mrs. May faces in reconciling her divided ranks is emphasized by the views of the Conservatives who are left to remain and join a separate city protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to follow the Chequers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, remnants supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist on continuing efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction – and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offers and “chaos”.
Mr. Bowen told a gathering of Leave Means Leave in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should become equal and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If I were responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Walesboro added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers."
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British changed their mind and that they wanted to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers are not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, they are not popular with our party and with our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
Let go of the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the assembled people that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political classes,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let them get away with it.’
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to betray Brexit, to feel the tide coming.
“We mobilize the people’s army of this country that has won the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-governing, proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
The crowd of activists were waving the banners “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour leader, complained to the Conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application after the conference opened.
“It’s people who tell us they can put in place IT systems and all the technology for the ‘Canada plus plus’ solution, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.”
Good Brexit, it doesn’t exist,” he added.
Vorenova plans to consider more entry into the race for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider well entering the race for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts talked about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, the Republican Party's representative, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was speculated that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holj<0xC3><0xB6>k was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
Some participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to “go to Washington to restore a shaken government, which means a woman at the top.”
Arrested Suspect Who Shot Sims, LSU Player
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Police have announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. ET at the conference.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday and sought help in identifying the man seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Vaid Sims was shot in the head and the same training passed,” Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the media via the 247sports channel.
Wade stood in the defense of his friend and Simpson shot him.
The Simpsons were interrogated and admitted that he was present, that he possessed weapons and that he had killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A junior 198.12 cm tall who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the final season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the World Champion title after the team left him a victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the Mercedes team would play a major role in this race.
From the pole position, Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Fetella to attack his colleague.
Fetel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to fly into the crowd at the end of the track, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went later and out ahead of Fetella, but Hamilton ran after the race with a wheel that left Ferrari's driver unwittingly in danger of retreating after a double defense move on the third lap.
Max Ferstappen rose from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led in the greater part of the race to reach a quick finish and took Kimi Raikonen's fourth place.
He went to boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds so Raikonen remained in fourth place.
This is a tough day because Valteri was driving great all weekend and as a real gentleman he missed me.
The team did a great job of winning the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday referred to Senator Diane Fainstein at a rally over her claim that she had not released a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad, rude, and dishonest."
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, rude and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the ads and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you let that go in public?
Remember her answer... did you leave a document in public – “Oh, please, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t,” he added, talking about the senator.
Fainstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter leaked to the public in September. Fainstein dismissed the claim that the information leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish her story,” she told The Hill.
“She told me to keep the story confidential, and I kept it as confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not appeal to the president who commented during the meeting on Saturday night: “You know what, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it was the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court candidate, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president said Democrats were using those charges for their own purposes.
“They decided to restore power by any means.
You see evil, filth, you don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwayne scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid off for a loss to the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday, in a 5-3 draw in Dundee.
The Giants have taken advantage of the two goals scored by Patrick Dwayne and Francis Boillie.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauny took advantage of the home ground before Dwyer returned the lead of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Landwood Nilsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League defeat in the season for Adam Kiff's team, who came to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between these two teams, and the Giants have won in the previous three games.
The two-time opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFol's assist, alongside David Rutherford who provided the assist after Bowley doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Sullivan returned the game's home-field advantage at 13:10 before Matt Markua assisted in the equalization by Kaunia at 15:16.
The pair secured the lead in the first third when he scored a second touchdown at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar equalled an excellent goal at 27:37.
Kauny and Charles Corcoran helped Nilsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and took care of his team's win in the fifth half of the final half.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died to Save Hundreds of People on Plane from Earthquakes <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after allowing a plane with hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong blows continue to shake this area and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA>.
Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to leave the workplace at the control tower that collapsed at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, flew safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sire, said the decision made by Antonis may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Pal.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, given that the National Disaster Management Agency has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigis and Butong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims continues to increase as many bodies are still under rubble, while many cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nagroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have destroyed the Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency help comes from the body at every moment.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what it will all find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the state army: “I ask you to work today to complete all the tasks related to the rescue.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lambock earlier this year, in which more than 550 people were killed.
The crash of a microwave plane: Air Niugini reports that one person disappeared after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which operated a plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said one person had disappeared, as it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to find a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at the airport on Chuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and the exact order of events.
The airline and the Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to break through the water to the bar to the exit for emergencies on a sinking plane.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and cried and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked nearby on port repairs also helped save by using the inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the downings of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
The analyst shows the chronology of the night in which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday concluded a retrial of a man charged with burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Raulett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Raullet said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which is contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a mobile phone belonging to Cheibers during the time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Saintford came to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lied because the truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records show that they only knew each other for seven days.
Raullet said that sometime after Chambers' death, Telesis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to deliver the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to continue during that day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip Hop That Raises Consciousness?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots – political messages and solutions to social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and restore the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
Performers such as Fujiz and Komon again became relevant in the UK thanks to performers such as Akala and Louki.
Is there another black person?
New York’s Grandmother Accused Couple of Retirement After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York nanny has sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that the nanny was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racists and identified the complaint with “exhaustion.”
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was a black woman when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ONE BLACK BLACK OSPBA," Ms Placo-EeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, "disturbed" Plasko-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their current nanny, who is African-American, did not do the job well and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reports.
Mrs. Morris was paid a day's work, and then called Uber to take her home.
Morris now sues a couple for compensation for layoffs and seeks compensation of $350 a day for the six-month job he was originally supposed to do while living in their home, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple rejected claims that they were racist and said the termination of Morissova's employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to have confidence in her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t plan to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But why would you give the kids custody of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
“Give it to me, please.”
Recognising the complaint with “exhaustion,” Plasco said that his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to attack someone in that situation?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denied the couple on social media and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In a recently revealed letter, we learn that the publishers of the book about Paddington were afraid that readers would not tie themselves to the bear that tells the story.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun now to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired by a little stuffed bear to write this children's book, would be optimistic even if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "was a milestone".
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was discreetly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was that man and he didn’t brag,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it felt like when people had a child who had achieved something: they were proud of him even though they didn’t actually do anything.
I think Paddington's success was about that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“Ned has regularly called to say that the situation is very bad, that he does not expect to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperus said.
“Then I received a call from Ned who told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs her doctors gave her to keep the heart beating slowly stopped and the drugs left her system.
She died some time before that, and this was actually the end of the whole system.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t bark or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not know what kind of hell she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but over the summer I felt an immeasurable compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning pose cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on one Welsh bridge that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a chef with great potential and an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always said that his smile brightens the room.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “darkened.”
After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by a brother who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there will be some consequences."
Ms. Davis made the cards “to put people in the knowledge that there are people you can contact and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphries, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom on Christmas Day – when the kids opened presents, he didn’t even look them in the eyes or anything.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to come to an end with it: “It leads to a breakdown in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we really get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation with limited time and limited scope – we might be able to come up with some sort of a plot,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the commission would come together.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition was due to the timing of the attack.
We are only five weeks apart from the midterm elections, they take place on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to go bad, they will be significantly weakened in attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush constantly calls on the Senators and lobbyists to provide support to Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently seats 51 representatives of the Republican Party and 49 representatives of the Democratic Party.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the decision and send it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen under Kim’s rule.
The number of North Korean deserters who have fled to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Korean ministry of unification, Park Byong-seg said last year there were 1,127 crossings – up from 2706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors, he said.
Pyeongyang did not give any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross into because of the extremely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have visibly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at delaying negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense that they would work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Rie said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve in Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the nominee for Bret Kavanaugh's Supreme Court "hysterical" and stated that his temperament makes him unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribunal in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t get the impression that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call it hysterical,” Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were teenagers.
During the introductory exposition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and squeezing his throat while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the person” who organized the liberals’ anger over Hillary Clinton losing in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was found to have prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself from those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to provide an answer when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to court if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this – if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential judgments against the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, addicted person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
And women should be proud of it.
It’s justified criticism, months and years of flooding with anger and she can’t get it out of herself without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It’s not a rare occurrence, is it?”
She continued, “To a large extent, I was helped by a woman who was the CEO of a company and who said she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, the person with whom she was talking was crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And it sounded great to me.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger in part because people basically don’t understand them.
One of my strongest memories is when I was at a previous job in an office where mostly men were once crying out of indescribable rage and when an older woman caught me by my neck – a cold manager who I’ve always struggled with.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad and they'll be glad to have you hit so hard."
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat called "The Mayman Business" and when he got out of the race, deeply frustrated Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der realized that there was no reason for her not trying to enter the race for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it 'Snow and the Seven Dwarfs'.
Since the campaign has already softened, funds have been depleted, so she vowed not to enter the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
This battle was doomed to failure.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she delivered a speech in which she said she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overcome by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money with the target voters instead of the white ones – as if they were going to get away with it.
“Someone would have thought I had experienced a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalled, referring to the way the press reacted to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they're gonna put on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial hiccups in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and although the battle was not even near the end, the gap between the countries could be suitable for Beijing in the longer term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, set off his first warning hit earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week by introducing new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) effectively taxing half of the total goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure each time, and the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the same measure to the U.S., and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economy will soon change its stance.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it needs to appeal to its demands, and public acceptance of U.S. terms would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of a trade war with the United States could, in the long run, have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for starting an economic solar eclipse in either of those two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a co-researcher with a focus on
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in restoring the country destroyed by a war lasting more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to re-establish normal conditions.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the regime in Syria would gladly accept aid in the restoration of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that financially supported the rebellion.
Europe faces another victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National Stadium in Paris, France.
The United States has experienced six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won by the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rna winning 14.5 points that it needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled during most of the tournament, threw the ball with his aunt in the water at a par-3 hit at the 16th hole, giving the match to Francis Molinaria.
The Italian golfer Molinari has shone in all rounds and thus became 1 of 4 players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit is powered by 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The best ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2 and 1 by Ian Polter of England, for which this may be the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European with the most wins in tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stand it.
This has been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup again.
The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after Europe's victory.
He followed a bacquet with his countryman John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 points in his career at the Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, which was surpassed only by Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend with making good moves, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaw, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick commented on his team's disappointing game "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we almost reached Europe.
We worked hard.
Every part of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, cooperate with the PGA of America association and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and continue to do so.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've got to bow down.
We're overwhelmed."
