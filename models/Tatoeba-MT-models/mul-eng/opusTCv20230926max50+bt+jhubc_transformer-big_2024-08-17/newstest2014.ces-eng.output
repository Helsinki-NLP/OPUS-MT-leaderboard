The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money for repairs to the crumbling road network, many are beginning to see solutions in a small black box that will easily fit into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre the driver goes and transmits this information to the authorities are at the core of Washington’s controversial efforts to renovate the outdated system of financing U.S. highways.
Usually, the poor design of the motorways at once sparked intense debate and the emergence of a wide variety of associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbied for the government to use these small cabinets, which would record the miles taken and maybe even where you’re going – and then that information would be used to build a tax scale.
The tea party is horrified.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken to testing the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking.
This is a real necessity for our people.
“It’s not a matter of when we can choose too much,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Administrations, who plans to start tracking the mileage of every California motorist in 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
This is what these technologies are for.
The bottom line is that the Road Trust Fund, funded from the tax that Americans pay at pumping stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will run more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by only one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices up to 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles taken.
It’s no surprise that this idea is liked by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change drivers’ behavior patterns, which, for example, can help limit traffic jams and the creation of greenhouse gases.
California designers look forward to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Representatives of the free market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for the miles taken.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 invited Congress to issue a payment per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which included about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means offending many kilometers for working outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for miles, instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has completed the pilot project.
New York is looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have a standstill.
In Nevada, where the facility was recently equipped with about 50 cars of volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“The concerns about Big Brother tracking and similar issues have been a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy management and operations at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the day-to-day departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many miles the car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon brought on such technology some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (a real perceived distance).
This company was not originally involved in an action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they would pay.
But this device, which it tests, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to do it if you don’t keep track of their speed and location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major errors have occurred.
They are much cheaper and less troublesome ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the fact that they give drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that a cautious public will approach this concept if the device will be able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so that in addition it would be possible to pay parking time fees, to provide insurance according to the miles taken and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that the motorists can drive to the site.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s draft document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge assembly problem.
Officials on the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Board say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupted Road Trust Fund by increasing the gasoline tax rate.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when it is enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracy is collapsing, the people and the grandmothers are talking together and they are going to have a common procedure.
If the social democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly played partners, who will put on the table a ready list of demands including ministerial posts.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD's envoys will then either join the acidic coalition hordes, or bow to the voracious minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days when he carried himself on the wave of sympathy, fell for the first time.
Yesterday, he was unable to control the political body and, above all, to force a committed liar to resign.
The confirmed negotiator is the only one on the side so far, the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (<0xC3><0x9A>VV).
I apologised to the members of the guild and now to the citizens.
You don’t have to lie in your personal life or in public.
'It was a mistake, 'said Michal Hasek, after negotiating with the lowest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he did not take the position of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10th at the <0xC3><0x9A>VV," said Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Similarly, the vice-president of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeron<0xC3><0xBD>m Tejc spoke.
However, he said he was elected just two days ago.
The two MPs then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-member club of the Czech SSR sound like one voice.
To the absurd theatre, Crown Prince Michal Hasek put it this way: "I am a member of the Czech SSR for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decisions of the party bodies."
Another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget, when calling for Sobotk’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that the August <0xC3><0x9A>V had 57 percent of the vote that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD made a powerful army of enemies by calling the <0xC3><0x9A>VV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with the snow of a variety of swirls and faves, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotk’s political career.
There will be a lot of dirty laundry, there will be signs of a dark alliance between the volcano Zdenek Bakala and the Sobotkov Wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radk Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes arise in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The words of Ostrava’s prime minister and Sobotk’s ally, Peter Kajnar, are alarming: “I signed Chart 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the <0xC3><0x9A>VV had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to sacrifice their functions ritualally.
The traitors will get their heads in the ash and stay.
And at the moment, the winning head of the Czech SSR will end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russia is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a careless smile, and then he only breathes out deeply: "It's difficult."
The cooperation with the organizing team of the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014 is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the Olympics last year.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information about essential things not so much anymore.
Maybe we've been baking them for three months now to give us how each village will be officially designated so that we can do a whole lot of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They still communicate in a number of ways.
Is there at least an Olympic village?
But it's not a catastrophic situation anymore.
A month ago, we went to the empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are worth it.
What does it mean to be empty?
Do I need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a danger that we will arrive there on January 26 as an advance, there will still be a feeling of glue there.
And if they don't fight, then what?
Do you think President Putin would have fed the army there?
That's exactly how it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village <0x3D> the dark-skinned village.
Rather, they risk not being able, for example, to adjust the road, not doing the details.
Maybe they'll have trips in such a state that we'll have to take the London games with us.
But I think it's kind of a mess.
How many Czech athletes could go to So<0xC4><0x8D>i?
Now there are about 78 of them, although, depending on the nomination criteria, that number is changing.
Maybe the Krasobruslars will go in the three of them they left.
Martinja S<0xC3><0xA1>bl<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> doesn’t have to doubt it, but otherwise it’s in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic Village look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by the subway so that we don’t just believe in plans.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in So<0xC4><0x8D>a.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, a plan to attack a huge secret warehouse
Fans of winter sports are already cutting the meter to the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are increasingly worried about their preparation.
The Russian Olympic Games, even if it starts in February, will face another scandal.
According to the Russians, they fail to fulfill the promise that the preparation and conduct of the games will not even in the slightest disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russian flag was very high, and the Canadian Games were listed as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for its own.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a huge pile of building material in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near So<0xC4><0x8D>i.
That is, a warehouse full of building material, tires, canisters and insulation foam already found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were silent and the warehouse disappeared.
Just for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a view of a warehouse the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, in the area of such places several have arisen, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is working on the site, which is building a roughly sixty-kilometer road between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already accumulated 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prevented from setting up a warehouse by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyru, all of them drive trucks full of waste material during the day and at night for three months.
According to experts, the waste is at risk of contaminating the local river Mzymtu, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"Water from here is contaminating the saltwater springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Kimayev told a British newspaper from the EWNC.
Illegal warehouses are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing will cost 43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, reports have also emerged that human rights are not respected when working at the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers opened his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are complying with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple matured to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself being somewhat slanted.
The request further stated that there will be two generations in the house who would like to live together, but at the same time everyone should have their own clearly separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the proposal, we respected the family ties, the history and the memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of the parents is on the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different final layout of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was created using plank panels, the part where the office is, is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete construction without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected to the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins on the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and from there they climb up the stairs to their rooms.
The stairs are the main dominating of the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to pass through them cascadingly.
It was this way that the architects tried to distinguish the house from the others and to impress him with something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is divided only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the house of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the highest floor is perceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house at the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs from there.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to the Earth and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators, and the leadership of high and middle schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at schools.
I've had more or less success with it.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, was even given the opportunity to take revenge in the form of an invitation not to celebrate the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and allowed the visit of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman: Technical Higher Education in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purky University in <0xC3><0x9A>r.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of politics in high schools.
The newly elected Member of the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and in addition, it seems normal to him.
Professor, this is really not the same as if you were to remain, for example, as mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to join the heitman <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who simultaneously perform the function of a member and heitman and as well as they degrade both professions?
This is how you tell people that they can handle both of these challenging functions on the left back.
I know, we have here an example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, who manages even a few dozen functions at a time.
This is not an example of the person you should be driving.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Fran<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, who has rather left the post of ambassador so that she can fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the Dean's office is that during the function you violate the apolity of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current performance on both posts as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your "school" even without being a dean.
I think that your students will have the same opinion as me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your withdrawal and keep your face in mind.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters are counting on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long lasting.
In Kunovi<0xC4><0x87>, bubble cabbage, chemicals do not add to it
In the coming months, more than a thousand tons of sourdough will be produced in the Slovak Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season here started in October and lasts about half a year.
Since 1925, he has been producing healthy snacks here in a traditional way, i.e. by walking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times it is a rarity.
Our workshops will find a nearly ten-kilometer route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks will contain fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, the filling of one will take three shifts,” said David Kladroba, director of the Slovak Fruit Competition.
The heads of the cabbage drive farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>ska and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavska into the area of the company directly from their fields.
The employees of Fruty then clean the vegetables, remove the bones and throw them into the circle.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into pools with a depth of six meters, in which they work tirelessly with droplets dressed in white clothes and raisins.
This causes the unwanted air to evaporate.
The last layer of dried cabbage is covered with a cloth and loaded with water.
"The green bean then matures for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of the substances supporting the fermentation," Kladroba said.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
The deer after hatching travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet-acid solution into bags or glasses and subjected to a sterilizer.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest in it is also recorded in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide active answers to questions.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP delivered to the media in Berlin on Friday, states: “Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to act as an opposition to the runaways and seeks to criminalize political manifestations through heavy lawsuits.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw accusations of criminal offences against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions in U.S.-German relations began to rise when a claim emerged that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel overseeing the news, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States,” he should.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo on his Twitter post with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he once left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens across the board and senior officials — including those in the United States — have assessed the discovery of an unwarranted system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “that the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Killing us sorry, but we are innocent, the representatives of the Khmer Rouge defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
The Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979, lost its life due to exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and the killing of more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population at the time.
Tomuto's commanders, the notorious S-21 prison, were sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and therefore intervene and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I didn’t have any authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge’s cadres “to treat or kill people badly, to deny them food or to commit genocide.”
But he admitted "moral responsibility" to the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
“Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives to the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea’s apology.”
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"She won't miss the second one," she said.
"If he had not issued orders, his subordinates would not have killed him," she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge are "worse than the monster."
The court was also to appoint the "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime Ieng Sary, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 found the court incapacitated the trial for dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 for the storage of the hand luggage on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it said passengers will be able to leave the entire box.
The new handbag charge applies to bags in the upper storage space, so small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with payment wait until arrival at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of their payments in advance.
"We wouldn't like to pick this fee," she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second bags delivered in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuck in hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one of the ways passengers learn to take fewer things on board.
O’Malley said that the meaning of this new fee is really not to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one front passenger at Frontier’s gate can bring a suitcase that doesn’t pay for anything, while the other front passenger will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O’Malley said that the website and check-out procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before arriving at the gate.
The new Frontier handbag fee will not be in effect until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
He claims that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street perceive the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of the fees for handbags did not apply.
Spirit Airlines was the first to pay for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Transport Advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for Spirit’s handbags would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former employee of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met Spirit’s unusual fee for hand luggage.
"I think getting on a plane was the most successful thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was waiting for the door to open and I could see the cracks in my teeth and the fights.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing took place in a fog."
Frontier also applies fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following the model of Spirit.
Frontier stated that passengers who get lemonade or juice can leave the whole can and the coffee will be added for free.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to impose fees for drinks, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, it withdrew and no other major airline resembled it.
Frontier’s last move to pay for the hand luggage, if the passenger does not purchase the flight directly from that airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to buy directly from them, rather than to do so through online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who purchased through an online travel agency, only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, he cut the reward for miles travelled to 25 percent of the way.
So the journey with Frontier is 1,000 miles long purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is starting to crumble and lose money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, the sales fell by 9% and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic seeks to solve Frontier’s financial problems as well.
The NSA doesn’t blame hackers for the fall of its website, it blames “internal error.”
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for a few hours last week due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
"NSA.gov's pages weren't available for several hours tonight because of an internal bug that occurred during a regular update," the NSA said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved during this evening.
The claim that the accident was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners noted that the NSA’s website didn’t work for at least six hours, and the pages are still unavailable for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” threatened.
The spokesman said that no classified information was ever compromised.
At least one group of online hacker activists claimed to be responsible for removing NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information as long as the servers do not overwhelm and the page does not fall.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No such agency, has become, in recent months, after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, the focus of public attention and the object of mass criticism of the intelligence agencies and the alienation of their secret files.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15 percent drop in net profit, which is due to a smaller number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not released any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is performing well.
The results did not meet the expectations and the stock market in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doersken on Thursday lowered the rating from “higher returns” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While smaller deliveries of aircraft were mostly expected, the range of profits in the field of transport greatly disappointed us,” Doerskens said in a message to customers.
As the pilot program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect that the market skepticism against this programme will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the lower market area, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company’s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, CEO, expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The senior staff also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program is proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's takeoff.
Every manufacturer has a different plan.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to launch the aircraft and will provide up-to-date information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – despite being in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – seems to reinforce our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerssen said.
Of the $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million in the third quarter of September, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, it delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our expectations, but low order intake and overall market conditions disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is a marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The top officials said that new prospects will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
A lawyer addicted to cocaine who warned the mafia against a police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass on information to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid that his drug addiction would turn out to be apparent.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who briefed the drug mafia on a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would turn out to be apparent was sentenced to three years in prison.
After becoming a suspect in cocaine use, Basharat Ditta, 42, had to hand over sensitive information to the boss of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough about investigating his drug trafficking activities.
A lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (the party) and who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance of Scarborough, which he had represented in previous drug proceedings.
Police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at his Blackburn Law House in Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular A-class drug user.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried diligently to obtain information on the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being investigated at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police detained heroin and cocaine worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in jail along with them.
The 42-year-old Ditta was giving information to criminals out of fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for a law firm called Forbes Solicitors based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after a three-week layoff of defending justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted to holding the cocaine.
The lawyer’s downfall came after Scarborough’s police investigation found he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place the drugs 60 percent pure under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Afterwards, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned to the house where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
The court heard that there were traces of Class A drug found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, saying that he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls into “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and hair samples were taken from him.
During a police hearing, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him at home because of work issues.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not violate the law than a law enforcement officer in the criminal field.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a legal representative and of having come into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about the drug dealer, but the drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the boundaries of a regular client-law relationship.
The police investigation was aimed at as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he insulted her.
He got too close to certain of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused the offence and declared, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta, from a law enforcement officer in the criminal field, became a criminal himself at the time he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His reliance on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups who tasked him with collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have in the public sphere a sense of trust and confidence that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit in Lancashire led an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the criminal to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand in front of our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was convicted of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the block of all deaths in America, as a guest at dinner, and as a motivation for the work, he wished for the inequality.
He was negotiating the government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasala have sent against Babis.
In the elections, the people won fourteen deputies, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of the UN.
But they are entering into the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to agree on the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasala - a man who, as a mobster, landed the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates, as this year's talks will unfold.
Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
"It's a horrifying report and it's on the spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply squeezing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the paper said, referring to the bill as unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be preoccupied because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually gives the government “full control over the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “has sustained a hard blow” and criticises the bill as “tough.”
Approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media has turned their backs on the government’s anger when it sent a security camera recording that soldiers were allegedly using a luxury goods store instead of the attack.
The police chief responded by letting two journalists and a leading media worker be called to the hearing, but the call was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
According to the new bill, media companies can be penalized by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of “listing out” or they can be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to dispose of the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is one punishment enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what the Kenyan "living blogosphere" calls.
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do what they want.
“You never know what can happen,” Nation newspaper journalist Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to politics, they'll bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have in the past been the target of public criticism.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fat wages to around 532,000 undelivered shillings per month, which is the highest in the world.
The young Czechs know how to save themselves.
Most of them don’t even know what interest they have.
More and more Czechs are giving away their money.
However, they do not reach the saving champions in the region.
The most money is deposited by the Rakusan, who save an average of 181 euros per month.
A little more than the Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This is the result of a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the whistleblowers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to give away more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of a ladder of slurries, in Romania and Serbia people still use saving products very little.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, saves himself at home "under the pillow".
This year, there has been an increase in the number of people who save higher amounts every month.
Last month, a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns were deposited each month by 26 percent of respondents, which is five percent more this year.
The average monthly deposit in the interannual comparison, however, fell slightly to 2078 kroner.
The biggest hit among saving products is the pension insurance.
This favours 54 percent of the Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the interest in building savings is declining, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16 per cent of respondents already use them, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also found that although people consider it important to save money, most of them do not know what returns on individual products they achieve.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is spent.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the yield of their deposited money has the oldest group of respondents, among people over the age of 50, 73 percent of respondents know this.
In the international comparison, the Erste Czech Group leads to the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Rakusans with a 12 percent deviation.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is immediately beginning to work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in implementing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said at the summit last night that now is the time “to rise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDG.
Concerns about Mozambique’s security are escalating due to a conflict of strong personalities
Under the umbrella of Samora Machely, the founder’s president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to call for peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she exchanged business clothes for a shirt decorated with the inscription “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
After two weeks, reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo side came almost daily, about some of the worst tensions since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous insurgent movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that there will be an open conflict in the country again, but recent events have been dominated by foreign investors and locals.
The bet is a fast-growing economy, as the discoveries of vast coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can be brought by companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the US’s Anadarko, investing in more than 50 billion dollars over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the resulting tension.
The Renamo party claims that the government triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala on September 17.
The violent attacks of the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the base of the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group’s leader, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for the Financial Times, told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of starting conflicts because he said he attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has been trying to alleviate concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told France’s AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakam saw himself as a “fearer” who wanted to use “anything left of his power to try to prove that he can dictate his own decisions to the government.”
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr. Mazangy’s words were quoted as saying that the Renamo side was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
The letter from FT said he thought the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
“Our goal is to get back to the negotiations, but seriously,” Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tension between these parties, which has been blown away by a series of tensions this year.
It is a charlatan between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Not one of them is a good negotiator and not one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been trying to change the election, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the pacifying movement to gain an advantage from the government and financial gain.
The renamo party's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the more recent party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Guebuza, who will end the second term next year, wants to destroy democracy in this country.
“The democratic system does not want more parties, it does not want transparent elections, it does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but has carried out explosive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the tributaries occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on in their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the railway for about a week, when the Renamo side threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace of development, and a recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that responsibility for the future of the country is solely for the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find a solution to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Stories about Thor may show that “the brute force cannot be equated with clever cunningness,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “be too wild for school education, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates for careful selection of works at an appropriate age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I've been pushing this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly teaching" authors and teachers are at the engaging storyline with a "slippery" message for children as a "turn-off".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf epic from English and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Anthem, says: “You can have good intentions, but you’ll do better if you leave them for yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly set forth.
The old truth is that it is better to show than describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed over the last half-year.
There is a new stage, visitors can curl up into new comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the image perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the room.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate an image," said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"The age of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classical personal computers," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k, a technician at the starry house.
Digit<0xC3><0xA1>rium is able to master the extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
In this way, the spectators will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to promote the purchased events and its own creation in the hall.
There are two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, turn on the centrifuge, and then on the visual examples they will see how the challenging conditions of astronauts in space are facing.
The second series is for children and has the title Magical cliffs - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of an outburst whose multi-colored inhabitants lived a quiet life until the moment a nearby volcano erupted.
The whole digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
Smaller amounts also contributed to the city of Brno and the stellar from its budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of the audio-visual technique and the computer," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The digital installation was followed by the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed two years ago.
According to the director Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 THOUSAND INSERT!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job ads, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
Thus, the Internet is becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first carried out, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two studies (2007, 2010), it stood at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities in itself significantly reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example might be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period of time, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
In contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0>tastnov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the frontlines of the ads were attracted by looking for managers and leading employees, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leaders of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer. . . .
Other areas studied included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English, as well.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of ads, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for ‘computer literacy’ appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily print in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54% of ads.
The requirements for practice are all associated with qualified professions.
It is mainly about the production manager and other leading employees.
In workers’ professions, it is mainly about mechanics and repairers or the manufacturer and processor of food products or about the repairer of electrical appliances, added the author of the study Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner.
Employers also state the requirements on the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have been emerging in advertising in the first place for a long time.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational skills, and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where a solo comedic performance was born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, a variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd how to whistle.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas solo comedy institute, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become successful to the extent that they are too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Billen Water Springs, and Bruce Waters.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year’s festival have emerged from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has grown up with his sitcom (joyful spicy "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but was most famous for her fast-spreading video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surrenderingly pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, slick, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drawers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in Larry's comedic DNA all the work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down a street between two buildings and says to himself, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil also fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil on Friday continued to fall as concerns about high inventories balanced the report, which showed the strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil supply index for December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange in the late morning.
On Thursday, it fell 39 cents and remained 5.8 percent for the month of October.
In the past few weeks, oil reserves have made the price difficult.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks had risen by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
Within five weeks, the stock increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports of Chinese production prompted a higher demand, which showed a growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery, which after the previous two weak decades rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, could continue to strengthen.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Not so, Mr. Hashka.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so mischievous.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends himself with the promise he made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The most beautiful program promoted by a liar is unbelievable.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he doesn't give up in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ku, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements set me in this, if you have just lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics on your own as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a fatherless weak man whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud, be it a missing person or a lifelong skeet.
It may seem unfair to you that I only speak to you, but you are the leader and they are only the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit down the embarrassment and then attack again, but that's how the partisans or the underdogs behave.
You are, I repeat, a leader in your eyes, an alpha male, so act like that.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court has blocked a regulation on the procedure for arresting and prosecuting persons by the NY Police Department
The federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the arrest and search program at the New York police department and called the judge out of the case.
A second U.S. appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision would be postponed until the appeal decision was made by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city’s findings and its corrective regulation came to mind, including the decision to grant supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The court of appeal said that the judge must be recalled from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as a judge she did not act on the request to avoid the appearance of entrepreneurship, partly because of the series of interviews with the media and the media.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search for people.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most likely to be stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after a police search.
The oral justification for the appeal of the city is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of arresting and searching people were criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there has been a halt and search of people for about a decade, but the number of recorded visits under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg has risen dramatically to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases involving blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to the minority, filed a lawsuit, which became the case of a group lawsuit.
Proponents of the NY Police Department’s stop and search program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve a broader problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand people over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for people who are constitutional, but she reformed the way the NYPD conducted inspections.
Five shopping malls face a low level of attendance
It is based on data from real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnice, the Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w Shopping Centre opens to the public, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 major business centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center versus location and poor layouts, i.e. too much floor or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, possibly dead center locations," said Michal Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, the head of retail real estate, about five of the malls face low visitors.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low-income categories of locals or overcrowding of the market in a given location.
Some projects have opened up almost fully occupied, but their results have been largely unsatisfactory at the beginning.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and disliked to change their shopping habits.
“New business centers need to try more to ‘lock’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing activities,” Samadi added.
The presence of shopping malls is generally stable, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, even at some centers it is rising, because the tenants were willing to cut off from the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened up that are not fully occupied and so reduce the average occupancy (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc)," Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
According to Sylvie Samadi, the shopping malls opened in the past two years are moving very slowly on the market.
There is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of small local projects, so-called 'convinience centers', focused on shopping and day-to-day services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k there is a place for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
And this is for small 'service' centers, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
“Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Plze<0xC5><0x88> have room for further growth,” added Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
In Prague, they see space for a prepared shopping center on the Victory Square, and according to him, they have a clear potential of Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop<0xC4><0x9B> and Weclavské square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allow merchants to cover and expand into smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, and the refurbishment of their premises such as
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping malls with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of rough rental space.
A quarter of all these shopping malls are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping malls, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson bumped into the phone to check his tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of “talking to the phone, watching and confronting” to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love affair that then-internal minister Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
State Representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said that the News of the World newspaper caught fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to storm into Pawlby's voice box and penetrate into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
“The state representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a person who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people outside, but a person who likes to tell people stories to see what they’re going to say,” Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of exploring stories: getting on the phone, watching, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the other, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But surely he knows."
Fans of the love affair that Clarke is involved in were first caught up in the NotW newspaper reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told: “You’re just wasting your time, that’s with Charles.”
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcairo's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records in a private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time that Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents were receiving anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were monitoring Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her with a voice message, in which he told her: “I got a story we’re going to tell tomorrow and I’d love to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was similar to that of other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was revealed that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunkett for his love affair with a married woman, while he himself was meeting with co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to cooperate with other people for the purpose of dialing telephones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to picking up the phone.
NSA Reveals Increases Social Paranoia of State-Based Surveillance
One day, at the end of August, a German police helicopter crashed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s domestic news agency, the mission was to take a photograph of the roof of the American pre-moved guard, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of the listening antennas, and the action launched in Berlin an exchange of views between the US and Germany's foreign minister.
James Clapper, U.S. National Intelligence Director, reiterated in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from an associate, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, the European government and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should trust the words of the director.
According to reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazilian oil companies and has gained access to data provided by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, it has achieved general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been listened to for ten years.
If it can be the target of the most powerful person in Europe, then it is certainly the potential target of the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY consultancy, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now poses the same high risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in Mr. Snowden’s entire documentation that the United States has handed over trade secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacked certain capabilities in the area of IT and the Internet, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
From the German parliament, there are rumours that we should produce a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he should not have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is coming to an end, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
The scope and technical prowess of U.S. intelligence agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies who have so far thought that the biggest threat from surveillance is China.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing technology, where European officials have been widely aware that data stored in the US falls under the jurisdiction of the US, and is therefore potentially under attack.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance business community, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the U.S.-based U.S. Prism program was unveiled.
Jim Snape, one of the CEOs of SAP, says: “We have this new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high-ranking officials argue that the latest news is only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to take away their most valuable secrets, and these data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“It’s been a fundamental topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the business and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not want to brag about countermeasures that they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least illogical.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to gather before a meeting of the board of mobile phones so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV Office advises senior employees to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be tampered with.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate reported in February, alongside Russia and Israel, in a second series of perpetrators who engage in hacking activity for economic reporters, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “they are the worst in France.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France’s internal news agency DCRI, said this month in an interview: “Services know quite well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, who died in a strange accident, believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a muddy fighting spirit in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a spirit-studded gymnasium in his high school gymnasium.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died by accident, but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
“They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this contradicts logic, physical laws, and also common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's about getting rid of what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in his dead bag," he said.
U.S. Representative Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis for a regular investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "half-duration".
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy revealed another cause of death.
"There are several questionnaires that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if in the event of Johnson's death he reveals enough evidence to order an investigation into the crime or civil rights violations, he will ask the FBI and its enforcement.
A representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators had seen.
The young man’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergy in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how the school board and staff are aware of children’s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline at their disposal – the most commonly used automatic injector of the EpiPen brand – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, “It’s like someone was spitting in my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I know my tongue.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate gender”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third sex of children born with a unique sexual system.
Newborn children will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to indicate gender as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The goal of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make their child’s decision to undergo surgery for the purpose of determining gender, and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersex.
An intersex person told the BBC after many years said, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm gonna be a sweet-scented doctor, bruised and dehydrated.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children are born each year, one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or warts) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if you can’t determine sex, it’s better to use the best available information and determine them, rather than wait and watch for the psychological and physical development of the child until the time before surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children it’s not,” he said.
Sex determination can be performed without surgery, and then you can wait for your identity to develop.
The knowledge of how a child develops sexual affiliation is not too precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typically composed of both sexes.
These traits can manifest in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people at work, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to label male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first “sexless” person in June when she won a judicial appeal to remain a “uncertain” sex status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have the third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female).
In neighbouring France, according to the news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of “theory of gender” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also defined itself against German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, where sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning the corner of two other pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children having sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told parenting websites.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the scenic River, which had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and repainted.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexual affiliation is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision, because they do not know how, given their gender, children will feel until they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The ongoing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous genders was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is subservient.
He created a new concept of “gender belonging” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how their child’s parents raised their child – had an effect on child’s genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case from 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
To the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged by a miscarrying, he recommended that they let their child be completely castrated, removed his warts, and raised him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had to re-operate on the boy and marry his wife.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these surgeries appeared "unhappy with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but with ambiguous genitalia.
Doctors were not sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and warts and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent to plastic vagina.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was horrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sex drive.
After learning the truth, he turned back to the man, took testosterone doses and let himself remove his breasts,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the advocacy group Advocates for informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law “calls for censorship and stigmatization.”
“Many activists fear that German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘indeterminate’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid it will lead to intervention.
We think it’s better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually prevail, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third gender."
“Adults should be able to make legally valid gender their own decision,” she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not take at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiographer who has a daughter with a sex disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would “give powers” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's female traits developed.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and, as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents a certain amount of space to not rush their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing child and you are happy about it.
You do not have to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to engage in decision-making and the child and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he or she identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk poured gas on the whole house: he was threatened with burning it with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear escalated.
The man began to threaten to burn down the whole house.
That is why all available police patrols in the area, as well as the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav Fire Brigade and the Volunteer Fire Brigade, have been removed.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene, who the men tried to pronounce his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So the intervention unit had to break into the house, which damaged and connected the man.
The attacker then ended up in a juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol detention center.
The firemen finally filled the gas-filled house with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to the people, all the pets were also rescued from the house.
He didn't give a man to the police negotiator, so he took command.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top officials had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the release of Biden would help revive Obama’s ailing remarks.
According to the National Political Writer for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers an in-depth record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House post office of Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the election by the minister.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew that the change was under consideration.
The book “Double Down” claims that Daley was the representative of an effort to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidacy would “not stand a chance.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been intensively researching a lot of things, and this was one of them," Daley said.
You must not forget that at that time the president had a terrible prospect, so we were like, "Christ, what are we to do?"
While Daley described the research as “appropriate care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to determine whether this move would pay off in the election.
“In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research if something is not really taken seriously,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential mix of cards.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “conscious” about the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double Down” definitely doesn’t answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama’s table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the research on Biden’s ouster from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous mushroom.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more you lie, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious” says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we’re at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to glow.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for celebrating Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because lighting a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every penny costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s experimental Bristol-based company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold notes.
However, its other product should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
Basically, it's impossible because of the break of light caused by the ice crystal that forms the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I have become a caregiver.
After two years, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year it probably won’t be any different.
However, statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will be celebrated by most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
Every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, 1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year they are the last to shoot fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy can no longer be just women; sexy can also be foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for the man, I expect that thanks to the procession of the dead we will see a lot of zombies, and I bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will reach out to our channels on Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for animal lovers.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kg of Hershey boards, lilacs, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and the Clark bar.
This is an amazing report for the 41 million college students who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are going to cross our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we will buy, and believe you will not believe and consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugar Pies around Halloween, almost 16,000 tons are sold.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never told you.
There is nothing more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (the horror behind the walls, which is by the way a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (the scream, the roar) and "The house of shock" (the house of shock).
In fact, in the United States, there are 1,200 officially dedicated horror homes that, according to the American Horror House, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you’re afraid of and that your friend is going to Facebook, and you’re not afraid of them, and you’re going to get away with them.
And finally, a little bit about the pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and cutting the pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’re doing it from a small one.
Fortunately for us, the “baby in the tub” trend started with Pinterest just last year, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The smoke-filled lantern with a moving flame on your front porch is likely to come from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of smoke has grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon of Napa, California, and try cutting off their barrels weighing almost a ton.
Announced series of Land Rovers
The interior has race seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercom equipment.
The selection includes improved brakes, a service package that provides access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an accessible path to world-class racing.
We are pleased to be able to offer them this path in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rallies races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, he said that there is no other way out and every government came out of voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, with an estimated life expectancy of two years from the start of the election period.
Opposing the fact that the next election is unlikely to be a completely different choice, he disagrees: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (against 2010, it received around 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that the early elections will be held, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement by Andreje Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will be lost.
The turbulence in the Czech Democratic Republic, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting with the party’s leadership, said that either he or Michal Hasek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leading officials of the Democratic Party, like the little boys, go behind the head of the state to allow them a coup in the side."
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was more clever and intelligent."
"Because I haven't seen anything so unexpectedly stupidly done in my life," he added.
And to President Zeman (whom he fought in the struggle for the presidency) he shook: “The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over that party.”
The first laws have already been tabled in TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Faroese Register of Treaties, which before the elections were held by the parliamentary committees, but with the early elections it fell under the table.
The president of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz claims that such a speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to precede similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the leader of the ANO movement Martin Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of the idea of introducing a contract register "stealing" the program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the jump - just scrapped the proposal, which had already been cut into the second reading of the House.
Firefighters have come to rescue a lost puppy who has been trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous sledge in a quarry.
The cockroach Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who was imprisoned in a quarry saw the man who had married the dog.
Firefighters were sent to the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire brigades who came to free him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous sledge in a 15-meter-high quarries above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cockroach, escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After escaping when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for his lost dog and put challenges on social media.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, he saw a bright-eyed dogman trapped by Ruby on a cliff in a 15-meter-high quarry above the ground.
Instead, he rushed the technical rescue team from the Cleckeaton fire station and rushed down to free Ruby, using a carry-on bag to pick him up from the rock.
Andy Clayton, chief of the technical rescue team, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
At the rescue, he didn’t blink – he was completely frozen.
But it's okay now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
Peter Lau, head of the technical rescue team, said: “The girls were very lucky during their escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “When I looked at the rescue, I was afraid.”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are so grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.”
The firemen were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't come out.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard" she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time ago and now she's very kind to me."
In a statement Thursday, the 70-year-old representative said he categorically denied ever making Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe you'll hook him up with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (singer) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
The next day, another terrifying story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for Scotland's membership in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of the belt checks in Berwick and the barbed wire along Hadrian's valley.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as one might expect – this did not pass into the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they are in line with them.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continuing disharmony would be a cheap retreat for Brussels to pay for whatever the Scots really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Plus, it's so old that it's been dug out of it, and I've heard a news anchor saying, "Independence means belt control," at least 40 years ago.
Yet, one interesting idea is hidden in this bearded storyteller.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to listen to Europe at all?
Why exchange London hostages for that Brussels hostage, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally ruined it.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, they gain the influence of a party dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already used almost five million votes in the federal elections in September, making the Bundestag essentially “exploded” the Free Democracy (Liberty Democrats).
On domestic soil, there has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a fiduciary bailout imposed on the national economy through a slump in the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are operating with a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system, which blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and German politicians want to keep that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production versus Germany.
The only aid is to reduce revenue and public expenditure – to which Germany calls for it.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are the root cause of Europe’s poor performance.
As a result of a “green” energy policy backed by Brussels – a code to support French and German firms at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not deter the European petrochemical industry from suffocating cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a stifling revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic EU supporters.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany on its knees and allow Paris to rise in the world at the level of Washington.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and in Europe it has established its own economic policy and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won crucial additional elections and moved the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the vote the most popular party in France – a timely warning to British Labour that they can’t persuade the right-wing split to automatically appear positively on the left.
How does Le Pen cope with its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc acting against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can dominate for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
At the same time, it strikes me that in the foreseeable future the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the common currency will unite and the euro will lose.
The EU will not disappear, but will instead turn into something more free in the sense of "Europe (sovereign) nations", already favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may be left with the euro, but France and southern Europe are renovating their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and stick to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including the possibility of notifying Berlin and Brussels when they are going to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would do well in the relaxed organisation of Europe on the assumption that it would keep its own currency.
Co-operation with other similarly-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and leave our economic independence behind.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not implementing austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the oppositionist stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair and libertarian Chancellor Alistair Darling.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland were to vote for independence only in order to adopt the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Timely Puberty: Matured Before
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white-collar counterparts.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching.
It has not been proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of previous puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared when her daughter starts growing breasts and kissing on the cheeks at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I’ve spent a lot of time making sure my parents don’t usually sign of rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, baldness on the abdomen and in the armpits and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When they begin to develop breasts, it will take at least two to three years before the first menstrual period occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (Timely Puberty for Girls: Nocturnal Puberty for Girls).
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what triggers the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered “prematurely mature”.
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which pediatricians can carefully monitor.
Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests in order to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are medical procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and curvature in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but admits that “suffering puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried that she might become pregnant, or how she'll manage her hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation together, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – just like girls – reach puberty early.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out the study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although kissing in the face and on the cheeks appears already in boys at a young age, the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to the topic.
Acne and swelling of the abdomen is common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryebsk Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to the child before you would have guessed,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely react well.
Girls who develop early need to make sure that although this happens early, this process is a common part of life.
Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> in the role of the household.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> (62) appeared behind the hype in the role of the owner and she was very successful.
That maybe a popular Czech actress would plan to change her profession and go to the pub for business?
Nad<0xC4><0x9B>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and turned up a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could live with a beer swirling.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today, with acting," she said with a smile to Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer, and I'm going to have Irish whiskey there," she said.
Nadi’s longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD> also appeared at the event.
I am after death, and in this new life I must not go to sleep.
I’m allowed one beer or one cup a day, and I try to keep that up,” he added.
Aircraft manufacturers want the width of seats, there are large orders in the bet
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights broke out, prompting a bitter exchange of views this month at an air show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-haul economy class flights – not exactly the one normally anticipated by airlines, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency requirements of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but Boeing’s main U.S. rival says it’s up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers were competing in the sale of the largest version of their two-engined long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is deployed – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of economic performance claims on the designs of the new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved 777X model will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out over 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out over the 9th floor.
Large airplanes often attack each other in technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai air show, where it is expected that the 777X will gain an edge with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he showed in advance what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture of three people crowded in a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats closer than they are in regional turboprop aircraft," Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in a statement.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has carried out research that suggests that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus’ seats and says it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airline balances fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they’re convinced they need to do to make them successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the passenger, there is a significantly larger space for the elbows, but for the supplier it is a growing problem that can affect the returns.
Behind this controversy, the race in order for aircraft with an estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to bend the tide of American and European exports.
As reported by Reuters in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats, in their latest designs.
Boeing’s performance requirements depend in part on the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weaker than the 10-seat concept.
“The reason why Boeing is doing this is to push more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Forty-five-centimeter-wide seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from Airbus’ business point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Road vendors of aircraft even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive organisation of the aircraft.
While comfortable, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus stressed the need for more cabin adjustments by offering a wider seat in the streets for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard of, but it can detract from the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, which I think is beyond doubt," said Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, an AIDS expert who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September, this year there were 176 of them during the same period.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September this year tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, there were 206 infected people.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>.
The least infected are from Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. for more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, the mother transferred to them.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the view is beautiful, says experts
Fantastic film from the Gravity universe sold out cinema in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, he saw almost 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews rated the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some of the nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of Starry and Planetary Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider modern, dream fiction.
The film does not exclude Gravity, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.
I enjoyed it very much.
You may notice the hair of Sandra Bullock, which does not appear in a state of ease.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving along a vastly different orbit, so they cannot be seen in a single image.
Some viewers of the film calculate the unreal acting effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of ease.
According to them, the Skafandres would not be able to endure such injuries.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and clothes without any major difficulties will endure everything.
Criticism was not spared even the plot of events.
Such an extensive tragedy on the Earth's orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technique.
People at the forums also argue about the "unreal" behavior of the wire.
It seems to be designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n (Director of the Starry and Planetary Hall of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide canvas so far, but I can clearly say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to consistently adhere to reality.
“More than the incompatibilities you mentioned, I was touched by the way a space station with a degrading level of technology (the last Chinese) is shown three times.”
"The rest of China will be by the end of the decade and probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated soundscapes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the physical laws, and so the naturally oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions, noises and noises
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris on the orbit appears in some scenes to be reversed rather than actually (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some of the things the creators have adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and calling to heaven a violation of logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film and compared it to the film
From moments that make no sense, it’s worth mentioning the fact that Hubble’s cosmic telescope is orbiting in a different orbit than the ISS.
As a result, there is a vastly different speed and rescue operations would not actually be able to run as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is not even a clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving against each other.
A new vaccine against nicotine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human trials, it is necessary to carry out further tests, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says that the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches can be overcome,” he said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information for the creation of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to create a fluid flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine injection.
In the tests of the vaccinated mouse, to which nicotine was additionally delivered, continued in their normal activity.
But mice that were not vaccinated “quietly,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies in the vaccine.
The injections had to be given so often that they maintained sufficient levels of antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as they turn liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they have a taste for cigarettes to try, and thus prevent addiction to nicotine.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop it.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying several state ministers to be hired at Circular Quay, where Mr. Obeid owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, restored without having to be scrapped after his ouster in 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks initiated in 2005, the government pushed for rents to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, the leases for companies in Circular Quay, which brought in $2.5 million annually to Obeidov, were restored without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, was pressing for a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the development of a commercial lease policy during these telephone calls the subject of the talks?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely, Mr Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Both.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, said a responsible official
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikia on Thursday night, the administration official of Fox News confirmed.
This responsible person did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on rocket deliveries in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree, while the President <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was breathing out the controversy.
Hejtman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of that misery of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The rest of the men mainly showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, and Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek's vice-president has made it impossible to have the most conversation on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate by Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov, the only one that would not have an initial handicap and I think it would have carried out a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what happened and continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> could set up a minority government with a simple blessing from President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the people, but with the People’s Health Minister Vovorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, as it would promote a proper referendum law and so committed to supporting the President of the Okamura Uprising.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually reconcile with the progress of taxation, for he is shrewd and will see that it is not possible without it.
The people would not cause problems, because the Call is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not otherwise be in government.
The same goes for the UN, a valuable minister would find himself here, but if they don’t want to enter the risky government participation, they will provide support, too, well.
Let's add courage to Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>!
Foreign workers with a visa authorization may be subjected to a ‘authority’ test
Considering how the government intends to extend police procedures, it considers the test of "authority" for foreign workers with a visa authorization 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria in order to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government-discussed article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew<0xC3><0xA1> condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers with words that it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The outcry of ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of the time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the Belarusian workforce should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if someone in this region recorded the sound of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is working with officials for human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail as to whether "the nomination is justified in the event that the candidate is in a relationship or in a personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds of them, it may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who was seeking asylum, died on suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old scared son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on board.
Australian authorities rushed with the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring the UK together.”
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to cooperate with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out more railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green, because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it’s also a connection – across the UK, HS2 will make it easier to connect 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
During the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unambiguously" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed rail has the potential to bring disproportionate economic benefits to Scotland, but it also delivers the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bring benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do as it is planned.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers over the next year and to making a joint decision on further steps.
Together with B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xA1> arrested inspections and analysis of anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvrn<0xC3><0xAD>zpravy.cz.
The MF DNES investigation found that the case was handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Councils (GIBS), whose people had to arrest B<0xC3><0xA1>rt in the center of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection resolves cases where there are among the accused police officers, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of analytics and informatics.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information with the impression that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Her spokesman, Radka Sandorov<0xC3><0xA1>, did not want to say anything about the case, she referred in turn to the City State Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in terms of the protection of classified facts," spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
It can also be derived from this inconclusive reaction that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation is Bart’s lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba.
The media said Bart was representing "even in this matter", but because it was classified information, he could not confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to the post of B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, together with former VV President Radek John, who was in charge of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute between the ex-premier Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV had to be resolved by the then President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
I don’t know where this relationship took place for me.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
Officially, he was sacked by Radek John, the real head of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
Bart was now running for election for the <0xC3><0x9A>svit movement, the parliamentary mandate only narrowly eluded him - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Awakening, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what it was.
"V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Inauguration of the direct democracy of Tom<0xC3><0xAD>a Okamura," he distanced himself from the problem of Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given the candidate the opportunity to vote.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta appeared in court in 2012 with his former co-worker with VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>rka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S., in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able on their devices to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the device remains in “aircraft” mode.
Passengers can already do this during the vast majority of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are investigating this decision, which requires a great deal of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had investigated the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in effect in Australia.
“CASA currently does not have any specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from the crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about extending the use of its on-board entertainment wi-fi system, was inclined to make the change, but announced that it would be subject to the regulatory authority’s decision.
“We would welcome CASA’s analysis of permissions to use electronic devices because we really think that now that we have (wireless onboard entertainment) it would have improved customer experiences,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the near future," he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and we are certainly thoroughly investigating the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and passenger information.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders the passengers to turn off their equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, the interns in Singapore are experiencing flourishing
Janani Amirthalinga stops her gold bracelet, ring and earrings at a boarding school in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore so she can pay for her daughter’s school tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and I gave all my money,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator she receives $2,400 (SGD 3,000) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman is carrying out its transaction, became the third stop-over on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stoppers in Singapore typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, starters have the advantage that they do not require a person’s verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that’s why, as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to stopovers.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to startups to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited the increasing use of credit in households primarily because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in view of the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ladder with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week was the only way to get out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“It is essential that with rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people’s greedily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange for cash their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items detained in 200 city detention centres are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
EasyMoney, Thailand’s largest stop-gap operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stop-gap service in recent months.
The growth in the start-up sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in the center of Bendemeer and 15 in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says CEO of Chieh LeueMax.
The company will fund using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it earned this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discounted lenders have been under fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says the ban offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and money laundering doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the asset stop is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
In addition, among those who use starters, there are not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of relationships.
“They belong to wealthy individuals who need to borrow for a short period of time because of their courageous business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeaha.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for the Tasmanian health care sector (TSA)
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for the slumping health care in Tasmania contains tough conditions that will ensure that the state government does not stop funding.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersekov<0xC3><0xA1> said the Australian Federation is taking "accelerated measures" to reverse the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems the state is facing," Plibersekov<0xC3><0xA1> said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in surgery at the patient's request.
Other 2,600 operations, including orthopedic operations and gray-collar operations, will help remove the liability.
The money is also available at clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinicians have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health care system,” Ms. Plibersekov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict regime of reporting and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money from the Australian Union, and monthly inform about where additional funds have been invested.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use "until real reform was followed in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in negotiations with the head of government in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can free the public health system from a critical state," Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional selected procedures will significantly reverse the recent deletions.
Federal health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “threat.”
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes out almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which devotes 300 million dollars, and pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar in the rescue package would be issued for a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel Denise Diderot, which brings exceptional film adventure and time-making, but is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France and tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by his family.
When he is upset, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally rejected mother depicted and for another he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never goes out of its way to frenziedness or sensuality, and that’s its problem.
The ceremonial shape of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience a p<0xC3><0xA2>t<0xC3><0xA2> similar wearing of a knitted shirt.

Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, a committee for global surveillance of chemical weapons said on Thursday, as sharp conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where the shells are located.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the time limit set by that organisation, based in The Hague, Damascus, for the destruction or impossibility of the operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and machinery for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of producing toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including yperite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting broke out in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts are talking about as the headquarters of the chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July 2011, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safir against rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaida for weeks.
Observable on Thursday said the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, during their mission, when in the midst of the ongoing civil war in Syria to rid themselves of the chemical arsenal, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that its team is now "satisfied that it has verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that due to security concerns, they were not able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “launched and ... items of the chemical weapons program that contained them were moved to two other declared sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the executive committee of the OPCW next month.
“I pledge the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had,” Ahmet Uzumcu, the director of observers, said in a comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, stand up against each other in the civil war against Shia Islam.
As for further development, Chief Observator Rami Abdul Rahman said on Wednesday there had been a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict of the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted sharply to the verdict of the last of the founders, who were set up before justice, and said Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Monday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could take a man with the nickname "Demolition man" (drummer) to receive the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Mrs Corteen told AAP: “It should be built in front of the correctional staff.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any other grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari's club was compared to the country when a strong charge was fired shortly after 23 o'clock on October 12, 2002 outside of a parked supply.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber fired a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while being kept alive, he “died” three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the other three members of the Jama Islami terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no other.
To keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not so much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bali.
He avoided arrest for nearly ten years, but was eventually struck in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where, less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
Verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air travel can now use technological exploits in airplanes (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from door to door” – except for calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated new rules, which was issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
Passengers are not expected to make any changes immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to individual airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft are in compliance with the new rules and that they have updated training manuals for the crew and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already delivered the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as they close the aircraft door.
They cannot be switched on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain does not issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane drops to land, and not turn them off until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and take-off, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gladingov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as the new rules are introduced safely – and we will work closely together with the transport companies – this will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we’re tired of being “watchers.”
However, surfing the internet, sending e-mails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers of sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there’s still no Words with Friends, an online scrapble-like game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when, as is well known, he was thrown out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air by transmitting towers,” Rosenker said.
The FAA’s Advisory Committee on Electronic Devices (FAA) has proposed last month to allow the government to use electronic devices more widely.
Pressure has been developed at the FAA in recent years to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio with them, the technical benefit of the time.
The new airlines are much more likely to rely on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years now, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices as part of the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasts than was the case with previous generation devices.
For example, e-readers only issue minimal broadcasts when the page is rotated.
But broadcasting is more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded a transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he is convinced that the disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmented reports from pilots that are intended to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device while flying according to the devices at low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a sensible procedure for the travelling public, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from the North Sea drilling rig and released back into the wild.
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month after he was previously treated by the Scottish SPCA in a rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This thunderstorm probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by strong winds above the North Sea.”
According to him, the forces came and found the refuge on the oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: “He was not able to take off again, so we were contacted with a request for help.”
At the time of his baptism, he was in good health and well-being.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and define what changes in EU relations British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we asked the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs what they thought about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside of Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government preferring new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than embarking on a long and exhausting process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
She had a general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – the consensus was expressed even by 40 percent of large enterprises, i.e., traditionally most pro-European companies.
And in the end, our survey of leading companies revealed the most outspoken of knowledge, namely that the unambiguous majority wants Britain to seek a change in the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which identified businesses of different sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring influence back to Britain.
There is a lot to bet on – achieving a change to the treaty and a better deal for Britain can mean a gain of up to 16% when voting in a referendum for EU survival.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that the UK trade supports his plan to renew the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this novelization to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, given how the euro area is heading towards a closer economic and fiscal union, is even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, and as the results of our survey show, for businesses this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels.
John Kerry admits that spying has gone too far.
The United States has gone into spying at times "too far", U.S. diplomacy chief John Kerry said in a video conference between Washington and London, according to AFP.
However, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, “the first admission from Washington” was in the middle of a fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to the scandalous disclosure of mass surveillance data by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President [Barack Obama] did, some of these actions have gone too far and we’re making sure it won’t happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the practice so far.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings were exploding, and people were murdered because we were able to be informed on time about the deposits," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far".
The affair around the U.S. intelligence agency, which reportedly tracked millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
“Today we are witnessing the milestone: Construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline is expected to add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of the Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” removed.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
There is a decisive battle ahead.
The Lebanese Hizballah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous area of Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
According to the still-deciding reports, Israel destroyed rockets targeted at Hezbollah in two locations in western Syria during Wednesday’s attacks.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah’s hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli raids on weapons depots in western Syria are only getting clearer.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla south of Lat<0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xAD>j.
The al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses in which the rockets were ready to be transported to Lebanon were hit.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jishay said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to deal with missiles.
The SA-8 is an obsolete missile that has been used by the Syrian Army since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions it is possible to hide them easily.
They are equipped with a radar, but after firing the gun will turn off, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakhiya is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-kept area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he is helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help the army get back Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n is located between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
According to al-Arabiya sources, the battle is to be repelled for a recent attack by the opposition to the command of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusair near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusair just left for Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wished for an early election.
As a reason, corruption, the disposal of money for pre-emptive purchases and government contracts, the increase in taxes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited.
According to the results of the elections, it can be said that the majority of the citizens were in compliance with this condition.
That they didn’t really care, and were actually satisfied with the state that was here (the theft and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not get to the polls, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all valid voters.
Which is a half-majority.
If the above-mentioned parties add 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters, then the old order (because all of these parties participated in the "debt" and indebtedness of this state) then 64.23% of the eligible voters actually agreed with this status.
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and expropriation of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD who have participated in this policy have adopted the appropriate laws?
Do we have any help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) have been charged with crimes against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on the Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before the charges were brought against the child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in Ji<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>e<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>e<0xC5><0xBE>e<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> z<0xC3><0xAD>m
But before the commission it was heard that in its initial statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never solved a case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences, and another when a gymnast at Caringbah from YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when he stated that the YMCA carried out external audits that assessed the organization as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible assessments in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that leadership from him down the line failed when Mr. Lord accepted without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, which he admitted during two years of working for the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety violation by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit at his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, which was Lord's superior, was "very horrifying to him.
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from the staff that they felt they did not know if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord darkened their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that he told the YMCA board in New South Wales that the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff "did not report", and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to allow staff to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the charges surfaced was made by YMCA's General Manager of Child Services Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid tampering with the evidence, but it was "extremely hot" and poorly executed.
A child sexual abuse expert, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, told the commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children from 2009 to 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, inspection, recruitment, training and personnel management, he said.
The hearing was postponed to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Blair has stepped down from the leadership position after ten years, he has mostly avoided talks on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the B<0xC3><0xAD>zko-Oriental Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer to London’s Evening Standard read: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to do that, so...”
While in Cardiff there were gatherings of horse show experts to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he still does not go to school and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this boy and his pet pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothed three laps to finally get the main prize and left behind 30 attractive mates.
These indistinguishable pairs – with the same height – were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, wrapped his beret in a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for looks and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily since then with this Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work together great.”
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him phenomenal, and completely foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who shows horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was encouraged and applauded.”
He ran across the sand along the entire length of the arena and although he acted so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and got two chickens in charge.
Because of how he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year race soon, and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: “The Fentons only have three, but they already know how to control the ponies.”
They make a great team together.
The reporters picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent performance and for the way they performed in the competition circuit.
They are always watching how good the team work is between the pony and the one who leads him – and Fenton and Toffee were at their best.
I'm sure Fenton's pretty good clothes helped, too, and he really fell for it.
Too many curious papers to be examined.
The Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter accused of the speech on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, the press manager said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a partially state-owned society.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper will now carry out a "full overhaul".
The "correction" regulation came from the State Administration for Printing and Publishing, Broadcasting, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was unorganized," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to “put Chen Yongzhou’s administrative penalty in the form of lifting the press license.”
He also ordered the yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a total revision of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express that dealt with financial inequities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed that he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false stories for pay.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told state news agency CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was worried about money and fame.
I realize I've been wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the front page of the apology stating that he failed to carry out sufficient control of his messages.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made confessions on television. . . .
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the change in this year’s law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway was found
One of the most ingenious tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico has emerged, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
U.S. authorities have described a tunnel about one meter in size as one of the most ingenious secret passages they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of almost six football pitches, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of unspecified warehouses, so it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel had been closed before drugs could be undetected in the tunnel.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who were reportedly working as drivers, were charged with holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of a conviction, he faces the penalties of deprivation of liberty from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth-largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after a collection of marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 meters long with rails that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economy in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step to transform the Centrum holding company into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economy and Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishing houses into the common media house," comments Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k, vice-president of the Management Board of Economics and the director-general.
The helm, which will be headed by a unified management, will be complemented by the executive director of the Andreas Demuth Holdings Centre.
Pavel Vopa<0xC5><0x99>il was appointed as the new joint director of the store and is also subordinated to the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The new head of information technology became <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Burda.
The joint editor-in-chief is Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pisk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team is also the director of transformation Jakub Unger.
The newly established function of the marketing director was entrusted to Adéla Pitts.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotsk<0xC3><0xA1> is the new manager of the independent corporate communications department.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, allow us to enter the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the creation of content of all issued titles and, last but not least, significantly improve the business management of the company," added <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
Economy company, owned by financier Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, concluded a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive email base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najsto or a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic News, IHNED.cz news server, Respect and Economics weekly, and the number of B2B titles printed and online.
Among Czech publishers, it is the most successful in the long term in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This year in June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
CME is targeting a TV business.
He'll miss almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to wipe out a thousand people.
Osekat aims at all side activities and only wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
That’s almost a quarter of the people who work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for the broadcasting of Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and the Czech version of the MTV music station.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV unit TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," Novy Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, communications director, said.
According to MF DNES, a significant drop in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact this should have on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both New Chiefs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who have joined Adrian Sarbu for many years, spoke during a Wednesday conference call with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television.
Therefore, it is quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
In the industrial area of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
In the industrial area of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a large capacity storage tank was burned, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire was set on fire on Thursday before 11 p.m., and the fire was still burning this morning," Prague Fire Department spokesman Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a statement.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the surrounding area, as measured, did not exceed the permitted limit.
The extent of the damage and causes of the fire are not yet known.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the area in Kolbenov Street.
"It's a fire of a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamcova said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we fire using the transport line from the cistern," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, a poorly functioning network of hydrants was complicated, so the firefighters had to transport the water from here.
The commander of the fire brigade declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are a total of four stages, the fourth is declared in the most serious situations.
Chemists also went to the scene to verify the level of dangerous substances that could have been released into the air during the fire.
“But they did not measure in the air the amount of harmful substances that would exceed hygiene standards,” the fire department said.
British police have given Assange a notice of release.
British police today delivered a notice of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's release, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a “issue notice” to a 40-year-old Australian by asking him to deliver himself to a police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Under British law, Assange exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against the extradition, thus facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, where the South American country sought asylum.
“Scotland Yard has delivered a notification of the release of a 40-year-old man who is requesting him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour he was assigned,” the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of the bailout.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notice of issue.
Assange fears that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving more than 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 at his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found that he had a drinking cup between the thighs.
At the Colchester Howie police court, he admitted to the charge that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
He received seven points in his account, resulting in a six-month ban on the proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and the fine for the accused <0xC2><0xA3>100.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign properties, the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance previously calculated the tax from the proceeds of the financial assets, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget presented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings in the price of over 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own real estate as part of the company.
Revenue from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in tax year 2012/13, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of real estate to high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is taxed little regardless of the level of impact of the scheme.”
He added that “this move could have caused some foreign investors to make real estate in London reluctant to buy, or the existing owners reluctant to sell.”
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record increase of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but were shaded by a flourishing “home market” in which, according to a survey by the real estate firm Savills, they experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the parishes.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of the tail are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs rotate their tail more often (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs move their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in the movement of the tail.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
We tried to do the same with other species.
He added that just like in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs react to the inconsequential tailings of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the tepid frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We’ve passed the dog films – whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any tingling stimuli, and we’ve also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and visualize it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw an otherwise imperceptible dog move by the tail of the carriage (from the dog’s point of view of the swirling tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she saw the tail shot mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view of the tail), their tepid frequency increased and the animals acted insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would communicate with each other consciously through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and do not pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and the movement of the transport produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
The researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to investigate whether the left and right side of the dog were important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert hearing from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dog robot was more likely to get acquainted with dogs when he snuck his tail to the left than the transport, when they became uncertain – quite the opposite of Italian studies.”
The difference may be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dogs robots did not look quite like dogs.
He explained that it could help studies on how dogs react to real dogs.
“While there is a slump of evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved to Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with a thrush.
The Sheffield group was due to perform on Friday at the Hydro City Complex.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at Hydro's Lido Complex in Glasgow."
"Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with uterine inflammation and unfortunately will not be able to come out."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances will remain in force.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are the ones who elect the popes, so Francis establishes his first group of men who will ultimately help to choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the pope’s election – the group is reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Peter Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial elevation of the new cardinals, there would be a meeting of the current cardinals known as the Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant, as it will be the first since Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this point, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has judged everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it is "quite possible" that these cardinals would ask the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is a complete novelty.
Valero said the popes traditionally promoted the bishop to the position of cardinals from great places, but Francis is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he is naming.”
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the U.S. due to the repair of seat backrests
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. automotive safety authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix the problem with manual backing.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism of tilting the front seats may have a malfunction.
As a result, the seat backrests are not in compliance with federal automotive safety standards for headrests.
The announcement, posted on the State Highway Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) website, says that “if the vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM introduced the delivery on the market in June and for this leading American carmaker it is the most important launch of the vehicle since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcement to the owners due to a 16-day government malfunction that weakened the car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were reworked for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama's Unexpected Voter Scream
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama’s sincere efforts have thwarted the Republican Party’s obstructions.
Obstruction policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year at the medical school, it would inspire me and restore a lot of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win,” and it’s reminiscent of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient’s sentences and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and your expressions took your breath away.
The election ended with a sharp overrun, and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My co-workers were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the papers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the 2008 presidential election, Obama had 82 percent support.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going to the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I introduced my first ballot, there have really been changes.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on available care to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “nothing to ask, nothing to say” after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the party obstructions have turned so much of an effort to move our nation forward: it is, among other things, immigration reform, the possibility of the public choosing health care and the closure of the base in Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo.
But in many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I felt in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain the agreement with the listening of foreign leaders or with the raids of drones that kill innocent children in the sea.
They can’t explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it is tracking those who expose the government’s wrong actions.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without a proper court or for restricting public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the finding of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can not even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if anything like that could have been expected.
At the age of 18, I was supposed to suspect that government power may be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course, and our public talks will form an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above appear to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unarmed alternative, and it seemed that he could not consolidate his policy or position.
I had the feeling that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had heard about before.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support dropping below 45% this week – is increasingly difficult with this book.
It forces me to remember a number of the promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat at the Pennsylvania primaries with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they must get back to the pace and remain faithful to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Government President Tony Abbott Is in Conflict of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Bavarian magnate, who is leading the dispute over a $6 million carbon tax cut, made the claim when he tried to move the question from the table as to whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a key role in deciding whether to collect carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from this policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for the seat of the Fairfax district of the Sunshine Coast by a margin of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote right away, and get results at midnight?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it possible to get results if someone doesn’t like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of ointments seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently, together with New Zealand, has published a joint contribution to the discussion.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program also applies to airports in the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
“We don’t expect any reward except that we can serve the company at this critical time,” he said.
You're washing your hands?
Scientists have found that they wash your hands with soap and soap.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an insoluble task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which had washed their hands after the failure, had a much more optimistic impression than the one where their participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in the next test than the other one.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which had no previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test indicate that body purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the testers have to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, it is not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs who have their hands, but it is already five percent on the way to urban transport.
Hygiene is usually also found after work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85% of people wash their hands.
Congratulation of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash their hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I'm afraid that reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented the results of a study by dermatologist Klaudie Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by control authorities regarding suspected currency market machinations is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities in investigations of the world’s largest financial market, where each day it changes owners of $5.3 trillion.
The mention of the two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR (London interbank interest rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our relentless investigation into this matter is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other bodies,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over records of emails and quick messages sent from accounts and to the accounts of a former trader to the British Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is assumed to have been relieved of his current position as European President of Foreign Exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of Cash Trading at Citi, took a leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any wrongdoing at all.
Mr. Usher's group for sending quick messages was owned by bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, the people said the dedication to the event.
UBS said this week that after Swiss regulator Finma announced that it had been investigating suspected foreign exchange machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers have partnered to move with the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or had received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are scrambling for years with old fast news and e-mails to find cases of some kind of crime.
Investigative reports have scared traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines of profit-making in investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that small currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they argued that with a large and high liquidity market with a foreign currency it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this does not necessarily have to be true.
A high-rise trader said that despite the significant volume of day trading with foreign currency liquidity testing between various trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, “you can start to have an impact on the market at a relatively low rate.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had missed out this week from its stock trading department, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have already seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter of the test confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infections across the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of failure of immunity has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing every year.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, and five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected and in 2010 180 new infections were detected.
The number fell to 153, but last year it was a record high.
According to the lab, there were 212.
“The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, no doubt in my opinion,” says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011 tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>.
In September, the doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to a funeral.
His visit will reveal more than a stroll through a bustling center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal the bedrock.
Many people “read from the graves.”
Gradually, the graveyards converge and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs are, how large and cohesive families belong, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
In what way do they express their social status, what taste they have.
And from the condition of the graves, they will also find out how they care for their dead.
U.S. Supreme Court Supports Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Law on Patient Protection and Affordable Care – which orders citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay a fine – does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Court President John Roberts was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining 2,700-page part of the law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, otherwise there is a risk of the loss of all financing of sickness insurance and non-insurance insurance.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises in order to block this law.
During the primaries in 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the supposed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a bullet donkey" is no longer a dangerous prison, the court canceled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public speaking of Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, and since the end of 1987 has been at its head.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year for contempt of the presidential office was threatened with deprivation of liberty.
“State representatives should not accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or in other public places,” the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
The nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines the freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the British BBC reported.
A number of Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dang, who were arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a police officer, were vocally opposed to the law.
In May, he ended up in jail for an opposition activist honoring Mugabe in public with the nickname "a bulleted donkey".
In August, the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with the face of Robert Mugabe as a toilet paper.
The court also declared an anti-constitutional law restricting media freedom.
“The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue,” said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who discloses false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law that allows criminalizing someone for false statements has a chilling effect on the right to freely express itself,” Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a strong hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March based on a referendum.
Small steps towards the dictatorship of a man from the country came in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister's chair, Morgan Tsvangirai.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and by 2008 the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are used in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy is at the brink of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with going to the farm.
The central banks will keep the swap lines intact
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need it.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible step," said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
“So far, all transitional tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so it’s no surprise to me,” adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening ties that began to emerge in 2007, when the international credit market for the first time collapsed.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision by central bankers comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program of support for the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money in the global market even higher.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency in the current surplus of liquidity of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching its third attempt to regain confidence in the European bank.
The EU has agreed to bank supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) collects personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn’t finish here afterwards, because there was someone sitting in the office who couldn’t complete the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and thanks to that I changed the address and the number of my passport.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it can’t because I have a different OP number, address and that it just can’t be completed and that I have to request the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
This is what I did, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
On that fateful day, my technical support wrote that I had to complete the registration at the branch office.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after the 4th organ on 25.10. they wrote that the personal data was deleted at my request.
So one would say that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they deleted this too).
So I used a different username and it came to me that my personal data has already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something stored that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When asked how it was possible, I was told that my personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and that I was sending an email with that error.
I did this (at around 15:00 yesterday) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this is why it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I’ve been in contact with technical support for a week now and I’m telling them that it’s still not possible.
And what about the fact that if it were true what it claims (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used the intended email and phone number and the world was wonderful, I found the page that sent me a link to the email to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport links the registration to the e-mail and phone number and the data just didn’t work out as it claims.
So again I told this technical support that they just lie (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing) because what they’re writing isn’t true.
I have proven several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't check your claim.
And the communication's over.
Respective repeats around the same sentence that registration is binding on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not actually take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn’t erase the data as he claims, but still lies when he claims the opposite.
What’s worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after I mentioned this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was transmitted for inspection and I will be informed (after a week of emergencies and consultations and warnings of the same error).
In the metro on the Bridge plays music
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has launched the Music project in the metro.
The first vestibule, where repeated instrumental music plays continuously during the operation of the metro, is the A-line Bridge at the exit on Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.

After an introductory intro and an acting session about a late musician, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came up with a candle in his hand and remembered the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theatre and the whole city went electric.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, two kinds of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also mentioned the birth of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Z<0xC3><0xA1>kolany or D<0xC3><0xBA>bravce near Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef M<0xC3><0xA1>nes, who put it on his watch, about ice hockey, but at the time he had no idea how we met in those squares and we scandalized who did not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we’re not going to play you here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a very suitable song for him during the day, singing at night, and accompanied him on the guitar.
Unless he sang, he played percussion, and all three of the singers were accompanied by a band consisting of a keyboard, cello, guitar, and double bass.
All three of the vocalists sang a bit of a chorus to the side of the heart of the seat, which immediately opened the stage.
"I'm glad you liked the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch city," Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek replied.
After the memory of Peter Hapk, the Confessions of Francis Segrad, in the original by Richard M<0xC3><0xBC>ller rewarded with a huge applause, Hanu Heger recalled the song Father liked by L<0xC3><0xAD>da Baar and with Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>'s explanation of the Communist strike.
The composer Michael Koc<0xC3><0xA1>ba recalled Sebastian’s song, and Segrado then sang the beautiful Prague song by Jarda Svoboda, a sad-looking native and a former Kol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xA1>k.
But that was already the conclusion, the applause in the stands and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
Another add-on has been added to the playlist, but fans have not been surprised by it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quartet sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, his books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested parties took pictures.
Berdycha with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka will complement Rosol and H<0xC3><0xA1>jek
In the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the unplayable captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til nominated four players Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan H<0xC3><0xA1>jek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to play on the field of the opponent to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to go to hot ground, it’s going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performances as always.”
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the winner of last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
The American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary humbug, threats, and millions of statements, they sent out planes, you hit the target and came back.
They would not be allowed to boast of the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
The whole action refuses to be confirmed and no longer expresses itself.
The exact opposite of the confused and bigoted, acts of unsupportive Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Do not confuse the media with their claims that the "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbollah" were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while U.S. aid to secular rebels in the country remains only at the rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue supplying weapons to Syria.
And it was precisely the fresh supply of Russian missiles deployed in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli attack.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Assad’s regime, not the rebels, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has designated two members of the Space Force, probably the Delta Force.
It is not known until now that they were commemorated during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former members of the SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city is known to me to have been members of the secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at a CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine guns (on one of these two SEALs killed by minomet) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
The Obama administration regrets the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially deployed and the whole thing was just weighing on what to do.
The commander of the team, so without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
However, the fact that it works in the country not once, but permanently the U.S. team, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that’s because until recently, nothing was officially accepted, and even now we’re only talking about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the United States, even though half of it is trying to eradicate terrorism in Libya, is doing well.
Even though it would be much more helpful to solve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media was almost singing Iranian air forces for the prosecution of American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the air, you can’t do anything about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew Phantom to optically verify his weapon without Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly showed up with him and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without hesitation.
It is no wonder that the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plze<0xC5><0x88> can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has been largely unsuccessful lately, defender or backup Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to the national team after a year.
He also manages shootings, plays with activity, after the procedure on him in the match in Teplice was ordered a penalty kick.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and in the Teplice after the win, but in the end she took one point from these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team in the game with Jablonec breaks an unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The men are carefully preparing for a difficult match with the Northerners, who are playing attacking football.
Everything goes to the game with Apple, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday evening," the Czech representative of fans at the Doosan Arena stands.
Plze<0xC5><0x88>'s last games did not go as he wished, but the word of the crisis of the defender Viktoria refuses.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse.
But I would not talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the defender of the West.
Victoria's crew will once again rely on the support of fans.
"He's playing on Friday night and that's what I'd like our fans, who are great, to invite."
"I believe we owe them a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pétov<0xC3><0xA1>: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not actually a step at all, but a big jump - a jump a few years back, in memory, in my childhood.
It’s a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, luxuriate and do your homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run away from school, put a bag in the corner and run out.
Play with the other children ball games, jump the pan<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys sew a chain stitched festive dress for grandma's birthday.
And then, after a few warnings, finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, in the winter apply wood to the pebbles and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the companion and instead of tasks to write the beloved verse addressed to the school love).
In the morning, breakfast with homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the content of which was not even lying next to the berries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I were so fond of collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio to the tapes, which were loud in the old tapestry around my mother.
And then we flipped the tapes on the pencil, and we kept playing around the same song, our favorite, and we drank a siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using boxes that were tied together by a rope - and when we were already on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the eardrum was sirka + wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live with it so we didn't miss anything.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobiles and laptops or branded clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "fashion" in the wardrobe was a batiked home-made t-shirt with the help of SAVA.
The electronics were enough to satisfy the aforementioned mom's cassette player and the Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used by the way only on a train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Klobou<0xC4><0x8D>ka Hop or Man, do not get angry, or as I have already said go "just" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under a tree, certainly his parents saved him a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up for a long time.
My younger sister snorted into him, said he was so beautifully poking the tapes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping and coughing.
He was asleep, but it was his last breath.
Well, and he's still having this event today, poor man, on his dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she snorted into the video and thought she was losing the recipe and didn't lose it, so she can't beat him to this day.
I remember how we were all able to communicate together, to make a deal without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with my sister, we made arrangements for the grandmother's holidays with the neighbor's granddaughter, when we will meet again next summer at the grandmother's - and so it was, so it paid off.
We're back.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village were running outside, building snowflakes, riding on a snow-covered dome at the church on sacks of hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, before each dinner, my sister and I were listening to this notoriously well-known phrase: "Don't wash your hands!"
Yes, it still applies today, but you certainly don’t have in the bathroom a cotton ball bound soap in the lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad was working in the garage at a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay down with my mom on the floor, washed our feet with pebbles, opened the door and looked at the flames, and listened to the crackling of wood that came out of the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we have on social media, we knew how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't send messages every day through different chats, SMSka.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It’s nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where black and white photos are neatly glued to the black corners.
And if I didn't know how much I was then, the year of taking the picture is always written from the back of the photo.
I see that although we didn’t listen to the cuts according to the pot very much and in addition we had pants after the bra by two numbers larger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - into reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait for modern times to come up with something for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now for the young generation of teenagers at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkey" and I think they're going to be a lot of times that they don't experience this "overwhelming" time either.
I wish I had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei have been sued for Nortel patents.
The group, which owns thousands of patents lost to Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company it had overcharged during a Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued the Texas District Court of Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to be found.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC are manufacturing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes strongly with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made Nortel’s initial price offer of $900 million for patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a trade partly motivated by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain patents in the auction, which are the subject of a dispute, Google has violated and continues to infringe,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation for Google’s damage because it says it intentionally infringes Google’s patent, according to the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpkov<0xC3><0xA1>: November smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off her smile, the one that she kept putting aside as a defense against the fondness of friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved, because it was a mask she decided not to put on in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was a grandmother and had the grandchildren of Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>k around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She very well remembered the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they've finally really walked.
So as not to embarrass your loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like a mask cover.
November, no other month can do that miracle to really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who has not been here for almost three years.
Egypt Names First Freely Elected President in Office
Muhammad Mursi took the oath of office, but his triumphant day would hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was officially sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who was sworn in 16 months earlier.
While in office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black tarares in a settlement built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been a non-profit for most 84 years since its inception.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car column, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential display, transportation was only briefly halted so that the column of the project could usually be a busy road connecting the city center with suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, ridiculously referred to as the non-charismatic “reserve tyre” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all the mujahideen in the ranks of those who want to conquer.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi said, dressed in a blue social robe with a red tie to the judges in a wood-clad chamber, where he took an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While he was on the alert, he received an official welcome from the military band, which played the national anthem.
The military commander of the Field Marshal Husayn Tant<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xAD> was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, the site of the birth of the revolution that ended last year's authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and solemnly promised to once again seize the presidential power taken from his office by the military council, which is toppled by the military council.
But in agreement with the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as is customary, he succumbed to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they need to relieve tension
In the ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should act in the future.
They would spend up to half of their time here.
They would oversee the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to the reduction of tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding areas.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would mainly help "accelerate social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, in the Czech Republic a few years ago there were about 300 poor homes and a quarter.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially the Romans.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She's a widow.
According to the experts of the problem sites, in the meantime, a hundred have arrived.
The relationship between their inhabitants and the others is getting stronger.
There were anti-Roman marches in several places.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
The fundamental condition is, he said, "consistent application of an equal approach in the enforcement of the law."
But that said without detailed knowledge of the place and people is not possible to achieve.
A specialist would go for walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In the trouble zone, he'd be supervising the order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or violations.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of illegal acts," the statement said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive extras, that is 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be financed from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being worked out.
The project is expected to continue until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not clear yet.
The answer is to provide an analysis that determines the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the completion of the project.
According to the design of the project, the first selected police officers will undertake an internship in Slovakia.
Every year, this training should be attended by five dozen members.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will act in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea, the interior should have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to fulfill an integration plan that social workers would put together with them.
They would have to adhere to the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, re-qualify and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move towards a higher standard of living.
The transitive housing system should function internally for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integrationally motivated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Dr<0xC3><0xA1>bek: Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a spectacular hill 3 km southeast of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Along with a few others, evidence of volcanic activity in the Lower Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k at a time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vr<0xC5><0xAF>ch is a striking white walled baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden travel chapel.
The host who stood next to the church did not protect himself.
Shortly after the completion of the church, a four-leaf alley, about 1 km long, was laid out.
The cross road on Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is already the third version, the original here stood after 1916, the second, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
On the 15 stops there are wooden plastics, which were made by the local art craftsman Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Lower Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k area.
Similarly, the foothills of the hills from the area constitute an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also given at each stop.
The carbon peak is a remnant of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age is somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venusian volcano (0.8 million years old).
The bomb was born an explosion.
She threw away a large amount of ash from the ash, along with fragments of the mines from the floor, which by burning obtained a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase it was poured on the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous cedar up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red, and places up to black tufa.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the wall of the break.
In the tufts, the spectacular volcanic plumes are up to 1 meter tall, and the second eruption was completed by pouring lava.
At the end of the activity of the volcano was lava, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of sputum.
The volcanoes in which the eruption of volcanic ash with lava flows is replaced are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcano.
The original volcanic cone was subject to gradual erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining the rocks in a quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining was carried out here from 1953 to 1962.
Tufa were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was able to stop under the pressure of experts and the public, thus maintaining this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly ventilate, disintegrate and dry down the slope.
The break goes away pretty quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch by the green tourist mark from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, or from Silesian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the lip alley, where even a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a ginger villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague’s most beautiful villas in O<0xC5><0x99>echovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in the restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Therefore, Ivan quickly sought replacement housing for himself and his then-old mother.
She received a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and the barrier on the other side inspired me," recalls Ivana at first impression.
At first, I thought it was going to be a provisional for three years.
“Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change,” adds the owner.
The mother and her daughter then moved from a one-hundred-foot apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The action was not simple, things were stored in friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but had to undergo the necessary modifications, such as painting the doors or changing windows.
The previous owner drilled out the core, but the owner was mostly using an impractically solved and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
A multifunctional living space was created by connecting two rooms.
The architects used a paperboard to define individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new location of the lights.
The first step that she decided to take after a few years was to remove the fence in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room got into the air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with a laminated one.
Ivan didn't know anything about the bathroom.
For years, I’ve been taking home magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On my recommendation, I contacted the young architect Kamil Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivan.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the layout of the hallway.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with open wings with one sliding, which saved the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
The quality fittings imitate the sandbox, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova continued.
As part of the series How to Build a Dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without aiding ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, for example, semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a violation of the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was originally able to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and to set up a custom-made box for the pillows.
The dining corner defines the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, covers the sliding panels with the wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marble has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: a soft non-slip surface without a spring and better sound insulation.
The system of recesses and recesses made of cardboard accentuated with color is an example of how the panel can work with space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivan.
The graphic glass cladding with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sill.
Everything is within easy reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the transformed interior works an excellent contrast of the new with the older one, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivan collects all his life.
The last one in the series was the kitchen.
The cabinets had previously been placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like in a tunnel.
The architect picked up their number and rearranged the layout.
The furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens slightly the pearly surface.
The small space was accessed thanks to the impressive solution of the washing machine, dryer and washing machine.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
A unique graphic with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which remind her of the favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and washbasin, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the curtain.
A large shower corner has a glass door for Ronald.
The task was to create a clear simple space from a given environment, in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and in color and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
“Another condition of the task was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and accessibility of everyday items,” adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Supreme Court has ruled that it is not time to sue.
The Supreme Court ruled that the former Prime Minister, Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, could also be prosecuted for any criminal offences he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schneider and Peter Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate in November, said the spokesman of the Supreme Court Petr Kn.
By this decision, the court rejected the proposal of State Representative Iva I<0xC5><0xA1>tvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the Member.
According to him, they accepted compensation in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and will not cause problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to sue the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was also detained by an anti-corruption police officer
Bart’s lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption of the VV Members, did not want to express himself too much on the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but in view of the protection of the hidden reality.”
According to the information provided by the Law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Councils (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that B<0xC3><0xA1>rta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prirnizpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bart was allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta with Petr Lessy is not related.
Eva Krop<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the police president, declined to comment on the case, saying that the Prague city representative was involved in the case.
"We will not comment on this question in terms of the protection of classified facts," said Prav, spokesman for the City State Representative in Prague <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It is there that the prosecutor supervises Bart’s case, and therefore it is indirectly from her words that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in a mode of secrecy.
The reporter Newsek managed to arrest the wife of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnov in the morning before their residence in Prague's Kl<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
She just loaded the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the movement <0xC3><0x9A>svit Tomio Okamura spoke to Bart's detention.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vit B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not or is not a member of the Inauguration of the Direct Democracy of Tom Okamura," he added.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, who unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region in the last early elections for the <0xC3><0x9A>svit direct democracy of Tom<0xC3><0xAD>a Okamura, is known for his corrupt case of the payment of Members of the Public Affairs Council.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Subsequently, the verdict was changed and Bart was acquitted of the charges.
I want a contract with the NHL.
I still have juice, desire and enthusiasm
For Prospala, she was always a family in the first place, so she wants to submit completely to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and still prolongs his career, or he'll definitely end up with hockey.
"I want to play the role of dad and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who's still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a declared worker who will never regret anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can thus knock out fellow players.
And also in spite of the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says resolutely.
He may be seen, reportedly standing behind him by the New York Rangers, who have failed to make it into the season and have two injured backers - the forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival at Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, it's not worth it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere has it been added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
This kind of communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It is about getting into a situation where this contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or it doesn't go to anyone and the manchaft doesn't slip.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together in order to get the contract.
But in New York, similar circumstances are happening, aren't they?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are hurt, and the team hasn't made it into the season, so there's a chance there, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received any yet.
This is the reality in which I have to live.
You're flying to America on Friday, you're expecting something to just knock?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5th, when the free-to-play market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, of course not. I'm going to Tampa for the kids and for the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's where it all comes from.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Yours already has two hockey games on Sunday, it’s a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time import duties?
Of course, one can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
Once it gets to a stage where all the goals, wins and records won’t replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want to do.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing the family could ever meet me.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - is also a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - my and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would be very happy if we could continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them a chance like that.
Do you plan on staying in the United States permanently?
We will practice it as we have done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will take us.
It's perfect to be still warm.
I have had great happiness in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
You and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who are craving this so they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have the will to sniff, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the desire, the passion, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have at the NHL that I am still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say you’re waiting for this season, how it’s going to turn out, and then you decide what’s next?
I'm in a phase where I go day after day.
Recently, the Director General of the Czech Republic announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant will be postponed to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current leadership of the Czech Republic is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is beginning to reassure himself that his ANO movement will not have time to learn political craft in the opposition, and that he will have to go straight to the government to have any.
The President of the United Nations admitted this in an interview for the Law to come out tomorrow.
Trade and marketing <0xC5><0xA0>koFIN leads Abrahams
Its competence includes the field of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Lu<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>antor.
For the past 14 years, Abraham has been associated with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then Fiat Czech, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for more than five years.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFIN was founded in 1992.
Police Evacuate Part of Los Angeles Airport for Shooting
It was shot in the morning at Los Angeles International Airport.
The police evacuated part of the airport, which is said to have been terminal three.
A Reuters news agency with a reference to the California media claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, said there had been a shooting in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether any of the victims are still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with a greater number of wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian rockets for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakh on Thursday.
With a reference to an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported it.
The Israeli press reported the explosion in the alleged storage facility to a large extent, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army, at the request of CNN, declined to comment on the information about the raid.
"We're not talking about foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli attack was rockets and related equipment that the Israelis thought could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP agency, with a reference to another US security official, reported that the target of the Israeli attack on the target in Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area but according to the DPA agency showed batteries of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen SA-3 rocket batteries, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the rockets have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry heads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, according to CNN and the AP.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will affect any supply of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreational activities in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to range from $325 million to $340 million versus $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase versus a record profit of US$290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre made an eight percent profit in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year began a rapid growth mainly in Australian and British out-of-service travel.
“As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
These belong to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Businesses with recreational activities started to grow in Australia during the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
The U.S. trade rebounded after a loss during the season's weaker half-year and is expected to bring a third in a series of full-year profits.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher at $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting the planned oil production in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by the AFP agency with a reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil rig were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, the move was planned.
The authorities of ecology first accused them of piracy, which in case of conviction threatened them up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, it was announced that the charge would replace a milder extortion that would result in a lower sentence with a seven-year upper limit.
Greenpeace, however, warned in today’s statement that the charges of piracy by the authorities have not yet been brought as promised.
This means that the arrests are now being charged with two criminal offences.
Last week, the High Commission of Inquiry announced that the charges of piracy would be replaced by the charges of extortion.
But when thirty inmates stood before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new charge has been brought against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were aboard the Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Under conditions of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
According to AFP, Greenpeace CEO Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexander was asked for help by one of Faiz Oulahsen’s detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is also part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the hours of English literature, it will be necessary to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British literature from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include a "hidden text" to motivate you to read more deeply;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to have a language exam, and will be asked to choose English literature as an elective subject.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education should issue new foundations for English and mathematics – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual office, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society” and that it is necessary to insist that a more “harder, more ambitious” exam is needed.
The study shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
In Australia, mathematics is used on an average of 143 hours per year and in Singapore about 138 hours.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive graduate exam in mathematics – along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results ladders – will likely encourage schools to provide instruction.
The curriculum will focus more on “problems from the real world,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Prime Minister Kajnar: Cancer in the Czech Republic is not me
Before the elections, a long-running dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD broke out.
All this came to an end when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, appealed to the court for the undemocratic composition of the candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express too much so that the party did not damage even more before the elections.
Now the votes of the voters are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostrava to step aside, and he will apparently also pressure him to resign.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
About what the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you see the election result?
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt us that before the elections they were resolved in the media disputes within the party?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It’s a party that has its own internal problems, is internally ill, and people feel it’s not all right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
I think the ODS has been going through a downturn for some time now, and unfortunately, similar things are happening now in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their forebears at ODS, moved to the people in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and have an influence on them.
This is related to the fact that the police go to the offices of the Ostrava Magistrates and collect computers.
This shows that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not only made up of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two invincible camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
But it has been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foreword to what is happening now in Prague.
The Haskovo wing gradually occupied positions, so that after the elections it could provoke a situation that weakens Sobotkov's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to approach compromises.
But everyone has an internal border where they can’t make those compromises anymore, and that’s my case.
I originally didn’t want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lk that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotk’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Haskov's wing made a mark on it.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Haska?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and to some extent also about visas for the party and for this country.
I admit that on the other hand, I haven't heard anything like that.
Michal Hasek is fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
It is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the state parties.
According to me, what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now shown in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you realize that the Ostrava leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD did not approve you for the candidate?
The political parties are based on a competition as to which of their members will be placed.
This competition should be largely based on programme visions and on the ability of those people to fulfil those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have a lot of skills or a vision, but for them, the political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is that when these people start to get ahead of themselves by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the party’s statutes.
They make their practices from the political sides of the mafia, and in my opinion they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you submit a proposal to the court for a preliminary measure against the form of the Czech SSR candidate in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current <0xC4><0x8C>SSD district executive committee in Ostrava is strengthening its power by enabling organisations that do not suit it to cancel, deliberately setting up new organisations, gradually expelling uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against him and they then canceled the decision on his exclusion.
This shows that trying to comply with the provisions of the party through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, this is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD led by MP Adam Rykalo is to withdraw you from the position of prime minister.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza has the seal on this post.
It is so, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything so that they can call me back.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then behind those votes they consolidate their power on the side.
When I go back to the past, so everything that might have happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Basala stadium, was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially censored so they could label me as the person who gives money where it doesn’t belong.
At the same time, the city bought a property that has a strategically high value for it.
So how do you see this further with your persistence in the role of prime minister?
The district committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
But I think it's like when a thief screams: Catch the thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the last ten years, I see no one in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of science and technology.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I won't read it unless I stop others from getting into the places they want.
Are you still going to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then the political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state if it cannot manage itself.
So I don't think I'm going to leave the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD now, because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to investigate me.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of the public ski resort
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Sp<0xC3><0xA1>len<0xC3><0xBD> said that preparatory work on the ski resort was started on October 26 and since Wednesday there are ice production units in operation.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The pitch has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
There will also be two stalls with a doll available for the Bruslas and the surrounding area.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skiers can comfortably overwhelm themselves," he said.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year, the ski resort was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the renovation of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the turn of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original location.
For the first time, people could shake hands in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ski resort was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.
Pamela Anderson let herself “screw” those iconic blonde cadres and put on a new, dramatically greasy haircut.
Pamela’s blonde hair is famous for her role in the sexy TV show Coast Guard.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with her new hairstyle.
Ex-cat from the Coast Guard got rid of her long blonde hair and put on a platinum rosary cut.
This 46-year-old actress revealed her last change in appearance when she went to LA on Wednesday and posted a photo on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that this blonde beauty has short hair, and we like this subtle change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>nsk will be dealt with again by a regional court
The Regional Court dismissed the allegations of a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and a twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the blame.
They are at risk of 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.
The spokesman, Peter Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court had overturned the regional decision and returned the matter to him for trial.
The reasons which led the judge to this, refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the complaint, the youths assaulted a 70-year-old man in his home.
The senior died a tragic death.
According to the complaint, his men were scratched, beaten and kicked all over his body, and also a metal object, apparently a gas gun, planted about three dozen wounds in his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the vertebrae, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he succumbed to at the site.
The young people reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, they were the only, in addition, indirect evidence against the defendant's smell marks, which the expert assessed as not fully detected within the meaning of the legal instructions.
Although the smell marks from the scene of the crime and on other matters were in more than ten cases identical with the defendants, the police initially treated them as actual and not smell marks.
In addition, there was some doubt in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the accused was not proven without doubt.
However, the court admitted that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
The doctor of emergency services was not even alerted to the violent death.
The criminals contacted the Olomouc doctors after a few days, who discovered signs of violent death during drinking.
The police were no longer able to work with all traces of the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
There was no DNA from the defendants at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk.
He is now serving a 8.5-year sentence, which was upheld by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths who are aware of the robbery of goldsmithing.
The robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The youngest of the defendants in the murder of the senior lives in Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>ta.
He was released from prison in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojm.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes January of the week Struny autumn
The saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will make a dot next Wednesday at the 18th annual Struna festival in autumn.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Lucerne Hall together with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>k is added to Shorter.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus's debut album Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will be released.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert at Strunas will kick off his world tour in autumn.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The number of interpreters he has collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell and Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they gave direction to the new fusion style.
For the past 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
As an afterparty after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the local audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
He said UEFA has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>, chairman of the Committee of Referees of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview for the Pravo newspaper.
Otherwise, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would threaten the posts.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> also denied that in her role she would expel the footballers of Plze<0xC5><0x88> from where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plze<0xC5><0x88>, but other members of the commission are expelled, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said in response to a criticism that erupted after Plze<0xC5><0x88> recently played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has ceased to publish penalties for judges, Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> assures that the judges for their mistakes are smothering.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, the delegation will limit him, no matter what the match is," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The reason why the penalties are not released is according to the Damk ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes the violation."
"We have a lot of suspicion and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have released the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop there will be tough sanctions," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really exceptional," she added.
If the information were to continue to be published, the commission said it could lose money from UEFA to educate and develop referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we wouldn't be able to complete a decision-making program," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Barta’s detention is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Bém: Is he behind the disappearance of the audience?
The President of the Public Affairs Committee, V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was also detained along with Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of the Anti-Corruption Police’s Analytical and Informatics Committee.
The arrest is related to the interrogations of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and former prime minister Pavel Béma (ODS).
The information about the senders, which was received by the server Newsy.cz, was confirmed by the Czech Press Office as a reliable source.
Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Béma’s telephone calls, which were published last March by the newspaper Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Today and in which the two men speak to each other “Maz<0xC3><0xA1>nka” and “Kolibrik”, show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k’s influence on the city’s steps under Bém’s leadership.
The newspaper said that in 2007 it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they fled to the security agency ABL.
That's where Bart was.
Server Noviny.cz noted that the detained criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek was working for the BIS just before his entry to the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek went to the anti-corruption service, which was subsequently involved in the interrogations, at the same time as they were published.
“With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all,” said Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD>, a prosecutor at the Prague City Council.
He also refused to confirm that he was in charge of the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies surveyed said that the issues associated with the two key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This is the result of a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the near-term effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are only beginning to realize at the last moment what a significant impact they can have on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the laundering of politicians, the business sector has long been uncertain whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually occur.
“But now they only have a few weeks to transition to a new right for their companies without any complications,” said Jan Spa<0xC4><0x8D>il, partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new legislation, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared on time.
In addition, 35 per cent of these companies are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
By contrast, every fifth company has not yet dealt with re-recordings, yet has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only 8 percent of companies admit that the issues related to recoding have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies surveyed, the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), the settlement of trade conditions (16 per cent), and further changes in the property cadastre and liability for damages (ten per cent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important novelties of the whole of the recodification will take place, and this unification of the adaptation of contracts only within the framework of the new civil law.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which the contractual law should become more transparent for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many news with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships," noted lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies as the most important issue.
The following are topics related to changes in the convocation and conduct of the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal regulation means strengthening obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in situations where companies are at risk of or are entering into a decline.
“In practice, this means that if members of the board of directors and business executives do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not open up the impending decline of the company, they can lose the benefit gained for the performance of the function only in the last two years,” he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language
My job is to preserve the tradition and at the same time guide our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, the head of style at Cartier, in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the West African countries; only one in 5,000 people.
Please vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year award.
In the CNN Heroes of the Year 2013 contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 so that he can continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall into unconsciousness over and over again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
At first, he was treated with only a broken hand, but then an infection developed in him that spread to the brain, and there hematomas that caused him problems throughout his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received such treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There's a lot of patients out there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 surgeries last year for free.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are energized by supplies, attached to the roofs of medical needs, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
Every once in a while, the vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: hospitality, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its broad smile and unconnected energy – is very willing to engage in local fun.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical assistance.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a berle or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school requires, but which many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local narcotics.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in a town hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to free up the space for the next patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early morning hours.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay up and keep working, they play drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free surgeries last year and is aware that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hip surgery.
"That will change the future of our family," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says it is this second work that funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and is working as a volunteer for Bwelley’s group.
They are always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that they can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“Dr. Bwellem was thoroughly washing his hands and removing blood stains or holding his instruments,” O’Malley says.
You will never experience this as a medical student in the second year in America.
Students will usually pay for their trip to Cameroon on their own and will often arrive with donated medical needs.
But once he arrives at Yaounde, he provides them with food, transportation and study Bwelle.
"He's definitely a hero," O'Malley says.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwelle, a constant fume is not a burden.
Helping others live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To laugh at people, to ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t restored the post of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, the number of which in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalized so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always contact, if necessary," said Martin Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t, Minister of Health.
I respect the work of my sister and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given proper attention by the Ministry as well.
In the performance of this profession, it is necessary not only high professional professionalism, but also human approach and personal conviction.
“I will gladly and with all responsibility try to take the steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
“We have excellent nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us too much to fulfill their vocation with all the empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of the nurse,” she said.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>, on the occasion of her appointment, also stated that she wants to deal with the various aspects of the work position of the nurse and intends, among others, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies and non-professionals, teachers and others.
“I don’t really want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competences and together with other healthcare professionals they form a playful team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself am faced with a number of problems that arise in the performance of the vocation of the sisters, I perceive these difficulties and intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, the simplification of the medical and medical documentation.
“From my own experience, I know that some of the administrative actions of the nurses unnecessarily burden and waste time on them, which they could and should rather devote to patients,” says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Other areas to which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with the team and with the management of health service providers, adapting competences and also working law issues, such as not complying with the law and not complying with the law.
We often hear anonymous tapes, but because of the fear of possible harm, they are not documented in a specific case where there could be a violation of the rules.
“Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and let the relevant authorities check the case,” concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1> graduated from the Central School of Health in the field of Nurses (graduated in 1978) and from the Faculty of Philosophy at Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has served as the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the CIS.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside in the internal department, she also worked as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the main nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several expert textbooks on nursing and articles in professional journals, she has been engaged in lecture activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
Not to end the hate.
The writer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it is not about a tender volume, it predicts the number of pages comparable to his most famous work of Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the day, Emil Hakl, spoke for Salon Kahudu.
Why did you write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so I don't end my hatred.
To see around you ever new and new clones of the human folly, young organisms affected by the blind selfish effort.
I’m not even talking about us older people, faces ruined by a powerless request, Vedic souls and, conversely, overworked ideologues who are trying to sell their “product” with the expression of a small sales bitch.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought myself a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, strangers and hidden crafts.
I've been through this.
Sometimes I feel my brain burn out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for a walk and then read a book at the lighthouse in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of boredom, hate.
Was there any break in the past that affected you, or are you just as old as all of us?
The break-up happened a long time ago, around 10 years ago.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I lived for.
There's still a quiet boy in there, though.
I see other lonely squirrels, everyone in my own tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I will participate in this huge, millennia-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breath-taking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games when another generation of beings emerges by way of an attempt-mistake, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some sort of superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you perceive your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather, a dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the level and forms in the book.
As the period of peace is permeated by the silent metastases of wars, which may one day awaken - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it'll calm me down.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and considers to be layers that are stored in the dark "under the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, a gray cerebral cortex, asks for older evolutionary structures, goes to the ancient flight circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks for snakes, searches for answers in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically – would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to a constantly changing presence, in an untiring effort to name and understand its eye.
Sometimes there are problems with the overload.
Analogously - as if you "dropped" your PC, from the program of a speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you would wind up first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up with a dark green adjacent screen Bios and a flash drive, in the background
For those who have not yet understood what this is all about, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You often mention it – why do you regularly get interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the mating of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a worm will appear.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "He looked for a long time into the abyss until the abyss looked at him."
Rich feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, psychologically "die" and a new quality occurs.
Why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer the analogy.
Once one fell into the mud and drowned, days, months and years went by, he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He's become a diver.
I hope some of the words I have written will help someone, as the Count's texts have helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, running through the St<0xC3><0xAD>nadles in the dark streets.
After all, behind all this branch of the authors and their message, it reads: "The sun shines on the worlds of other Karl Hynka M<0xC3><0xA1>cha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the reflection that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then again, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "life" or better known as "worlds".
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can wake them up to life whenever we let their sentences flow into their brains.
It's actually, in its own way, something forbidden by the divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes, and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in a spell - according to the old demonological books we admit to witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, as it is, a chain of authorial readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to do it again with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather just say that today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are unobtrusive, they don't pay too much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiatives, you don't feel lonely with them.
Let me give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec lived (and I hope he still lives) one curvy bookstore (it is called by chance <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a fragmented, read copy of my book.
In my disappointments, I laid down a just-discharged morning and cried briefly in a man’s voice.
We all stood there quietly, quivering, and sneezing with a sigh.
Then the young blond blender couldn't stand it, and with a roar he jumped out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the night landscape and ate with the happy anger of the senses, the hurt soul of the peasants and the path of the fallen natives - they went out and waved like wolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and contentally different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Dark, Presence?
It's a story.
It’s a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian fairy in the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying there, there's a gray trout on it.
Fear, fear, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be devils in hell a long time ago and gambled - what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you going to leave it on a free flood of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - B<0xC5><0x99>ezina Island.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unremarkable, similar to the motion of the continents on the planet, influences our desire from such depth and breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon – and so, of course, we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with a flood of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, die in defense and acquire new personal territories.
Sometimes there will be a disturbance and we will radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human beings.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean unconscious, and in a holed sail made from a dirty handkerchief catches a flood of wet wind.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama resigns from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned from his often repeated and ambitious pledge that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Recalling hundreds of thousands of reports of statements from Republican providers in recent days, they accused the president of lying to the American public.
Yesterday, Obama learned from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can afford to keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Considering what he called a “media buzz” about the statements, Obama called on Americans who received the announcement to look for new insurances on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased the insurance themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
“I say this to these Americans on the level: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been “offer” since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Sebelius, outraged by this phrase, which was captured by the switched-on microphone, called yesterday to the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was also involved in the program.
More than three hours during a hearing on Sebelius repeatedly touched upon the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Who are you going to call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from agencies and from the back of the room, their hands are already in their hands.
The transaction announcement should come in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for the LTE network, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek owns the KKCG group.
It was launched under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications at the frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company’s taste in telecommunications.
But now Sazka is led by a very experienced telecommunications mascot Robert Chv<0xC3><0xA1>tal.
He started as marketing manager of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Zazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admits that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
This would probably not be liked under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the Economic News, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a tender on the LTE network (as a novelty can attract a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to be allowed to go to the auction at all, or it will not bother to issue only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will let Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
Zazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent on Vodafone for some provider of fixed internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovenian branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big mollusk that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have won the LTE network for O2 and most likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will be sharing the network.
The auction could finally be a success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech TV ever be able to operate without signatures?
It has entered the era of President Zeman's legendary scene with ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaint that collects the evidence of the harassment of the castle society.
In the past, the betrayed influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k has not been documented in this way, i.e. to be signed under it.
Truth is, the management has stopped the editors.
However, the cases described do not give an answer to the question from which such affection of some journalists is taken to the groundmen - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of improper empathic disposition.
And while we are already assuming a general frenzy, the question cannot be forgiven whether the changes in the relations on television are being pursued by other, not least unscrupulous, power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
It is true that those who say that in developed countries there is no apparent attempt at intervention by politicians in broadcasting.
The truth, however, is that this does not mean that there would be no complaints in the media.
Complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven’t reached this stage of civilization yet, and this situation isn’t with us.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of the opaque situation in which the behavior of many imperfect peoples is exposed.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curse of this country: presidents on the edge of power
It is almost the rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill its national duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for its legitimacy there.
And most of all, from that capitulation, the nation would not have had a cocoon to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman, and he was still fit for Munich, but during the war it started to go from the hill, and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
To be better at it, he could leave for the third time in exile and undermine the legitimacy of the Communists and their coups.
It's a shame to talk about H<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
He was elected by the fact that "Mr. President will not get into a situation where he would judge".
But he had to, even though a big decision with a knife on Hitler's neck in the Chancellery probably wasn't.
The head of intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, until the last days of March 1939, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not pass to the Germans so smoothly and with such a profit.
The senile president and the scared government did nothing, but they did not believe him, but they were afraid.
Gottwald's human care allowed him to execute his flight companions, as Moscow had ordered him to.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and had to sit it, already quite senile.
That Hus<0xC3><0xA1>k was a helpless and sickly depressive old man made things easier in November 89, but that's the only lie.
Havel was lucky to have not met him in office in recent years, he was saved from the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like what it looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not so visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not fully in power.
It is not a normal state.
Could we not elect a president in this country, once again, someone who is admissible and admissible?
Remote planets, black-and-white films, or a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on Earth aren’t subjects that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would come up with.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6 in the large hall of Lucerne in Prague will finish this year’s Struna festival in autumn, that is, everything is related to everything.
The quartet score by jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feeling of musicians.
According to his mission, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing right now.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film images.
However, this principle of freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a holder of nine Grammys, a former co-player of Miles Davis, and perhaps today's greatest living jazz saxophonist - is unexplainable.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to be surprised by life.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they’re disappointed when things develop differently,” Shorter says.
How Thai Insects Raised Paris Bar Market
You may be squeezing over an insect, but you don’t realize that you’re dreaming about half a kilo a year.
Take, for example, the moustache.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you are also taken care of for a unique experience.
He was the first person to list the insect in Paris on his company’s menu at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, named after William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre, a popular tourist.
With a fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, a spice and a crispy egg, guests can now not only taste different larva, raspberries or water broccoli, they can also taste oysters.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insect does not damage its wings, turn its legs or damage its eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu lists several reasons why you should consume an insect right now.
The first of these is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, the insect is an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not close his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he said.
Far from everyone would probably be thrilled with the idea of eating a broccoli decorated with pests, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insect is, according to the owner, very positive.
Even sceptics will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bones and eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and a lack of interest in the state to solve the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, will save considerable amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and construction material manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, significant leverage and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
The Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the resolution of the Government and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges could be declared within its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog shuffled the carpet, the president shrugged and ended the bells
On Thursday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in L<0xC3><0xA1>nej.
What medical condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the U.S. defensive stance on his surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented admission that in some cases the spying “has gone too far.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for acting as an "autopilot" in light of the heinous disclosure of NSA spying activities that emerged thanks to informant Edward Snowden.
Public information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video link at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that were happening out of the fray, because the war was over, and the war was over, and the war was over.
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed the border, but stressed that no one’s rights have been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA is seeking the good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the planes from falling, buildings have not exploded, and people have not been executed, because we are already able to find out about these plans ahead.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad that relate to alleged U.S. espionage, and convinced the Europeans that it is necessary to continue to fight against it.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats that he would stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency’s (NSA) surveillance.
For the national-security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remains with us on one ship, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism regardless of their anger at NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency’s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing.
Another revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
The director of the National Intelligence, James Clapper, defended the Allies' spying as necessary and said it was a matter of common concern for both sides.
In the midst of the storm, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hopes the delegation will see members of both sides and the House.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to get involved will be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help repair relationships, he added that “well-defined educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they have been using for years.
“While we are regulating our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to be aware that we are not the only ones spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hostility already triggered by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance.
Australian woman appealed against staying in Thai jails
A 21-year-old Sydney woman, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a land court on the island of Phuket on a false charge when Thai police said the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, attacked her in the morning hours on Sunday, Feb. 10.
However, a recording from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police from Phuket Island conducted interviews with Bamford two days before she found out she had made up her mind about the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back to Australia.
“Obviously, it’s a difficult time, but we hope he’ll come back to us as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail for 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a court case that would increase her sentence and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel employee Michelle Smith’s office in Phuket, Thailand may also try to fix a shady picture for tourists, which may have just been a liberating verdict.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr joked: A goal from the Brejk?
He got a puck in the defensive line and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape turned after a quick forehand click.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night the 119th NHL winning goal commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, the director of Czech Roads called my agent Peter Svobod and asked him if I should not be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote on the introduction with the nickname Jagr.
I think we are typically very similar.
I guess I'm going to have to end up with night training so I don't rush any further.
"I'm afraid he might call the defense minister later and want to advertise on the sprinklers!" he added.
In addition, New Jersey scored a second victory in the series.
"And above all, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is taking place," concluded Jagr.
Place of approval candle-licensing goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that did not enter the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally also the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of their internal split.
The politicians served us a gullible gull at the weekend instead of the candles.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement, which promised voters to change the political style of rule.
The disparity of the election result and the disintegration in the winning party record a political (for) Mr. Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters who did not publicly support the party that President Zeman had not even elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost a strategic jump over other policies due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few other ways to get it back – for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is running out of chances to get a prime minister’s chair in my eyes, the businessman Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, on the contrary, is approaching.
While the preferential development is still miles away from the rapid and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the Czech SSR supported communists, this development is only a better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Due to the ANO's vocal opposition to joining the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL (a total of 111 members).
Due to the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite overwhelming for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the Czechoslovak SSR, composed of "non-residents" in the castle, is unlikely to succeed.
Moreover, any government to which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another split in the side.
So I ask myself, “Can’t we manage to self-sustain early elections?”
Other elections would already be a referendum on the strength of the UN’s electoral mandate.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, significantly increase income taxes or build a state bank fell under the table.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the contrary, agree, for example, on the support of business, the alternative fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of the employment of disadvantaged persons, the reduction of the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
Third-party areas are most prevalent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
However, YES now has a top, so the program would rather be tilted by the most likely coalition of YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still going on in the economy.
