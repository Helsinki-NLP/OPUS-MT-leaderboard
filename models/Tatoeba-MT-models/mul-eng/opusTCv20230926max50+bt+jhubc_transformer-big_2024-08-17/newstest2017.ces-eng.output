Eighteen-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 18-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was this week on the steps of the local store.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t seem to want to hurt him, and adds, “He’s finally starting to get better.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of a forensic doctor said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
Louis Galicia’s brother for the ABC KGO in San Francisco said Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters restaurant said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
“We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much,” he said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank slept in the hostels at first, but that recently "he finally started to thrive."
"He found an apartment, went with the girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think anyone would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any arguments.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that shone every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the share of modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 is gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, the Czech Railways have invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to decrease the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
The greater part of the investment put the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent of the company invested in the restoration of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are listed as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of <0xC4><0x8C>D-powered vehicles would increase by ten years.
Some older cars are on average, the average age of which is 23 years when the upgrades are counted.
Taking into account only the age from the date of manufacture, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, the classic sets made up of wagons and locomotives are gradually disappearing from the Czech and worldwide railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive died from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic cars dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
For example, from the investments that the Czech Republic plans to make in the vehicle park in the near future, it is possible to specify the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to plant on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a single-lane tramway with a rope.
The contract includes the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know a quarter of a year about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
For the fourth year, the online newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of a billboard in the south of the Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristic interesting walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
The traffic controllers know it's on the street, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, it is the fault of the Chatter Act, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main line from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno stands on our territory at the state road advertising billboard line.
Not even three months were enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structures with a huge advertising poster.
It's as if no one cares that they're standing right next to the train, in a 50-foot security zone where nothing can be worth it for safety.
Road managers claim that they can’t just deal with billboards because of the law of the hole.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
“We can’t afford that,” says Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Road and Highway Administration, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must prevent under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate started to be watched in detail in the online newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be solved effectively and quickly by the authorities.
Only in the south of the Czech Republic, the editorial board counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to the car or near it.
There are other regions as well.
"We have trouble forcing the company to remove the ties," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech-Buddhist Regional Office Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Klas, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klasy, the law that binds officials is to blame.
In advance, the billboard owner has to make a phone call to put the ad away.
But the chiefs of companies are often inadequate or know the fake, which Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has already described in the past, when the problem started to be more detailed: just move the mobile stand with the advertisement a few meters and the officials can give the previous call to remove black and black.
This is because the office needs to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they look at it as a new device and we have to call the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Klasa.
The new law will not help.
A new law could bring about a change, which from September next year will ban billboards on highways and limit them even on I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't do that.
Companies can still earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on rents of illegal land, and no one can.
For example, the billboard appealing to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech-Buddhist master’s degree is currently running three administrative procedures for purpose-built billboards.
The company faces a three-hundred-thousand fine in each case.
These are several advertisements that have been placed in the Class I road protection zone without permission.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mr<0xC3><0xA1>z, head of the transport department of the Czech-Buddhist Magistrate.
The ad that Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in does not yet appear in these cases, but it will soon arrive with the greatest probability.
According to <0xC5><0x98>SD spokesperson Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case thus gets to the regional and then most likely magisterial officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can’t be contacted.
He does not take over the post office and the official seat on <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s post office went to South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who had a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
In the spring of this year, when the <0xC5><0x98>SD began to encourage Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz to take an interest in advertising on Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his retirement home, where he allegedly lives.
However, no one has called the highway managers from this address to this day.
It's a futile fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in the seats are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads stood still, maybe in other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting windmills, he admits, on condition of anonymity, one of the officials.
No one has yet dealt with the bill in this regard.
At the same time, he spoke with a number of members who were interested in the problem.
They have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were members who wanted to extend the term for maintaining billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government refused.
Billboards are not only very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic to national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand they need them themselves because of advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don’t stop with the fairly introduced impression that if something doesn’t work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers harvest fewer grains this year, but more raspberries and poppies, according to statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s yield is above the average for the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (3.9 percent) and maca (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year’s crop yield will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decade-long decline against last year.
Last year’s crop of cereals was above average.
This year’s yield is above the average for the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, this year, the harvest of raspberries and poppy will be higher.
Crop yields are 3.9 percent higher than a year ago, when they reached 1.256 million tonnes.
This year’s crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The expected decline in cereal production is caused by both a decrease in yield of 3.7 per cent per hectare to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in personal area.
This year, the farmers felt three percent less fields.
Wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3% less this year.
The farmers put her in more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Roughly a five-fold decrease in statistics predicts the barley spring, which is most often used in the production of beer.
The reduction in yield is worth the reduction of personal areas by 15.2 percent, but also the lower hectare yield.
On the contrary, the barley of the winter will be born by 6.3% more.
The harvest of wheat will also grow.
The yield of rapeseed statistics is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The area of the ossuary has expanded by 7.3%.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 per cent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed yields exceed the 10-year average of 13.3 percent, while the crop is one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there has also been a pop-up field.
This year, farmers planted 35,543 hectares.
By 2008, when poppy was growing in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, it is half the field.
Thanks to the expansion of personal areas, this year's collection of mak will be richer.
Last year's rate rose 2.5 percent to 27,423.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 per cent lower.
Police in Olomouc charged two men with knife and machete attacks, and the court sent them to prison.
Police have accused two attackers who on Tuesday attacked the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete of a 45-year-old man.
“Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him a tearful and severe injury that required treatment in the hospital and further treatment,” police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The two suspects were arrested immediately after the attack.
The applicant submitted a proposal to the court for their arrest and the court complied with it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 45-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The assailants caused him a severe and severe injury, the man who ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday afternoon at the Freedom class, police said.
The hostages ended up in custody, police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> reported.
A collective feud between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive speech, two attackers attacked with a knife and a 15-year-old man’s sword.
Although the man tried to escape, he was injured in a carnage and cuts that required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokesman said.
The riot, which attracted a lot of attention in the center of the city and for which several police guards and guards had to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
The criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 70-year-old man from Olomouc have been accused of trying to seriously harm health and excrement.
The applicant submitted a proposal to the court for their arrest and the court complied with it on Friday, the spokesman added.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouc during the mass battle of the attackers also five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten armed strangers attacked the guests of the company who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced two foreign attackers to conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most egregious examples of unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the center of Senov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>né Square.
It used to work as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several busy houses, which despite their location, size and often also monument protection are only empty and eat with emptiness.
We chose properties in the center using the project Pr<0xC3><0xA1>zdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax, they want initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton’s income – over six million dollars – is behind their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
The majority of Clinton’s income – over $6 million – is in favor of their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2% of the income on taxes.
But Trump has a similar problem with the move, so far he has not decided to release the tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump will not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after the publication of her confession.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to secrecy around Trump’s income, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as wealthy as she claims, the AP said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower income would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in a tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax deductions over the past ten years.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their profits on charity and spent 25.6 percent of their earnings on tax last year.
In Nigeria, the resistance broke down again.
The Islamists from Boko Haram defended the consistent vaccination and killed the doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child molestation have reappeared.
In the north-east of the country, the government has issued emergency vaccinations, as two children infected with the disease have died.
Vaccinations were carried by helicopters.
Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram have been working in the affected area, who have defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected.
In northeastern Nigeria, emergency vaccination of children against measles has begun, as two children infected with the disease have died there.
In Africa, the giant was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly transported vaccines against a child's gun to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are operating.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also on Thursday made it impossible for doctors to get to the area where the children with the mule were found.
Both affected battalions came with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the expulsion of the rebel Michel Zaffran told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a crucial way.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of measles are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the measles outbreak had been eradicated.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that it is possible that although the disease did not develop for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of rebellion in the world.
While the defence was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
In Rome, the Pope met with former prostitutes.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from the gang of paschals.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
During this meeting, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek wanted to draw attention to trading with people and call for strengthening the fight against him.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who had been freed by the police from the power of a gang of paschals.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the stories of fallen women and then urged them to look with confidence into the future, the Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30 years old.
According to the Vatican, all were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
During the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to the trade with the people and to call for a strengthening of the fight against it, the Pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the production of jihadists.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not happen.
The French have the support of the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is also planning major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer halls.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are more than 100 jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France are preached in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The French Islamic Foundation will be the key to ensuring that these goals are met.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now home to the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the Foundation was to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
However, the institutions soon hit internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate over a new institution to replace the non-functional foundation was ignited.
All of this accelerated further terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let himself be heard that the new foundation will be established as early as October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of the mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or halal food tax.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for this in order to provide certification.
Some of this money would then travel to the fund's cash.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by the French travellers who travel to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them go to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have gone through special educational programs at French universities should be involved in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is fighting against radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced recently.
In France there is no place for those who in the mosques proclaim hatred and do not respect some principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are about 2,500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have thrown away about 80 imams, and in a few dozen more they consider it.
Not everyone, however, thinks that the government’s actions can be very effective against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatov<0xC3><0xA1>, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint with the star Baugem.
On the way to the semi-final, the Czech track cyclist has to pack in the corrective rides.
Driver Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after qualifying for the top eighteen, he lost in the 1st round to French Grand Prix champion Gregory Baugem, a silver defender from past games in London.
The procedure to the eight-finals must be wrapped in corrective rides.
At the start of the Royal Discipline on the track, 27 riders stood and the best Czech racer of the moment attributed the 14th best time.
The two-wheeler with a flying start arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main scoring phase, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen reached out to an experienced Frenchman in the end, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
The gold defender, Jason Kenny, has been brilliantly successful.
The 18-year-old Brit took the third fastest two-stroke in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record of 9,551.
It was easy, as expected, to consult with the latter, who was the German Maximilian Levy.
There was also a British quartet in a draw with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km race and made it to the final.
The previous maximum (3:51,659), which the British had four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing: They want fresh wind in the field
The representatives of the young doctors met to approve the new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the entire Council to support further field activities from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have not been able to resolve the issues regarding the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained “still silent” on the issues, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive body of the JDC, by voting, has decided to reject the proposed new agreement completely and request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the ongoing programme of out-of-control action since the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to declare six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of BMA’s young doctors, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
Members of the BMA at the pre-voting meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of the “Indistinct”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of a long war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition in the overcrowded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
It was hand-delivered, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiate heat from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his “Dear Friend” to Mr. Putin – five times, one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin was spreading wounds around him and accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
Worse still, it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
A month later, the state-controlled media led a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it looked like the Turks could do anything for it.
More serious was the accusation by top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin got the apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost out of power during an unsuccessful coup last month, which is why he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also apparently shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a severe impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has been reduced by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will be able to rest here when there is a resumption of flights.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers to be a foolish reaction to an attempt at a coup.
In addition, the long-standing irresponsibility of prolonged talks on EU accession and Putin’s accession – which are eager to take advantage of the cold and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after an attempt at a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to show what one of the analysts described to me as a “connection of the incompatible”: how the forces of the two countries that feel to be rejected and exploited by the West combine.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise those differences. . . .
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the risk of a complete disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane – it is certainly better that the two leaders speak together again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is to be suppressed in the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was half-naked when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bailed out of debt.
At that time, the strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer finance.
She has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations rugby league championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock-market coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
BBC Scotland said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investment brand and the brand that our employees are working for because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands.”
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, it has also become a global brand of RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspiration, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“The time has come for us to move to a bank of brands, because the fundamental question (which we are betting on) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical to say that we're going to be a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with the way we've focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there's a lot of change going on.
We can remind these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on horse Predilection brought to the target of 3000.
Dettori sprays champagne after his double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Joker Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in the UK in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory of the evening on his local track - the horse Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden.
Fifty-five-year-old Italy is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in level achievements.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champ from Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar's horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very impressed because my family is here too.
I'm so glad it happened in Newmarket, because it's where I hired 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and I am very grateful.
Dettori Gets Congratulation When He Brings Predilection After Victory
Two of this milestone’s jockeys have reached the milestone in hurdles – jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record-breaking career has scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and is not surprised that he has reached the milestone, which only a few riders have reached before him.
It is stylish and strong, but it is precisely his tactical fistron that distinguishes it from other riders in the saddle.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at the Epsom that if he hadn’t driven just on weekends and big hits, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie has driven the winner in the UK for most of his 30 years of career, and that’s really something.
He has a lively character, which is good for the British catch sport. But more importantly, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous summer jump
From the summer finishes to the summer jump, Frankie Dettori has been a envoy to the British Plains for two decades.
It was like riding a mountain bike.
An undisputed number of major race winners, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from starting because of drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and returned in the best shape despite all the doubters.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin Is Leaving the Head of the Presidential Office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-six-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had “released Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted to the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When appointing Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are being followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Do you believe in smiles?
This step has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and as well as Putin worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men declared that the president's office was at his own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, once thought of as a possible president, is suddenly eager to lead Russia’s ecological policy, met with great distrust.
Putin’s comments are quoted on the Kremlin’s website, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very challenging post, even if you could say a problematic post, entrusted to four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the Committee on State Security (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At the time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in the lead of the state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years before he returned to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Criminal's Thoughts series, was released after he shot the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the stage last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI agents' team, are a little later.
The 40-year-old actor, who starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has acted in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of the criminal, and over the past twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the town of Banff mysteriously landed in a fish garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand pits that left a water splash there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film on the Periscope Channel of his finding on the assumption that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
Thus, it is the first of four closures between the "plane winds", which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended wires.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fort to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how the construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel on an impressive scale to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extreme precision.
In its place is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being poured in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the tip of the earth’s construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by pulling the northern bypass 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled by climbing about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are “happy to be alive” after the water from their fishing boat at Anglesey washed them away.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue vessel station reported a fire on Friday at 1:20 p.m. British summer time after the crew saw the Moelfre Bay incident.
All three men tried to get into safety while their ship continued uncontrollably on.
“We saw their boat circling near them and we were attacked by the worst,” said Moelfre rescue ship commander Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men rescued a local fishing boat, and a third man in his 60s was found without a life jacket exhausted as the fighting raged.
All of them were transferred on board the coast rescue ship and transported back to the rescue ship station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shut-off, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who steered the ship when it was overturned.
Someone was holding a protective hand above those guys.
The judge refuses to deal with the case on behalf of Tlucho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>'s wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who had allegedly received political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then head of the Jana Nagy cabinet, a lucrative post for political resignation.
In 2012 it was the approval of the tax package.
Shnajdr, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state companies.
And so they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was unjustified, and so they received a total compensation of almost 2 million crowns.
The complainant now appears as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Kl<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> wants to be careful (she solves criminal cases - see ed.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague judicial district.
The King has already forgiven Jan Nechas’s guilt twice, formerly Nagy’s.
It was the alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka.
In this case, Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> did not figure.
However, according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way that the court can rule out whether the witnesses have a wife or a relative in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at all, he noted for the journal.
"I think it's boring," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also charged.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 held a hearing on the accusation of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1> (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>) and others accused in the case of abuse of the Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1> comes to court with her husband.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had to deal with statements about Peroutkov.
For example, the expatriate’s wife was supposed to judge President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkov.
Zeman said that he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the students is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an airstrike by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old friends last February from London's Gatwick Airport.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on the report of her death.
The young Londoners, who fled home, were secretly transported to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have reportedly been targeted by the media for their former co-worker from London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year’s case sparked a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that as many as 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them have joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
A well-paying job that you don’t even need to go to college.
That's what it looks like at first glance.
And often on the other.
The advantage is not only the extremely high salary for Czech ratios (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 CZK for work in IT), but also the extreme advantages.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought after are, according to statistics of the staff agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
Therefore, it will not compete candidates for a job position, but a job position for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not a necessity.
However, higher education is not a necessity for orphans.
Higher education is a good foundation and is the overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but often does not have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers need to constantly learn new things, which will not replace the once-student college, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
It is most profitable in Prague.
The wages of the eagles are everywhere moving high above the republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
“The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,” Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
Technical directors will be able to make the highest profit.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, wages are lower, but they do not fall below CZK 80,000.
The demand is also for IT project managers.
On arrival they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
It's also about the graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, this does not apply to needles.
If you want to move companies and transfer an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach out to the graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
Without language, they won't work.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at the same time, at least decent English is necessary for needles.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet with a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally trained and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more than one foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director of Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka supplies.
Good in Google, there's heaven.
Only quietly envy can the Czech workers to the employees of Google.
Of course, for them flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shortened shifts, not only for moms.
“The company provides a four-week vacation for newly-wed dads after the birth of the baby,” says Martina Jonekov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Google spokesperson.
The accommodation also provides health care for employees and family, meals, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Those who want to be educated are green, and it doesn’t matter what they want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full fridge free of charge is also definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some places as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-cookers in all offices, where people always find a healthy meal, the spokesperson explains.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what he doesn't dream of, he puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible benefits on Czech ratios?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important for employees to sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions.”
The United Nations has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN’s human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is of serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for criminal armed fighters who are organizing hunts for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey", he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who move to Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
And even worse, they are often prosecuted and jailed for a year or more if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A lot of people over the past decade have lamented that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer spending free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from the stands and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally spent on television, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m talking about the mode of Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90’s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed due to the huge interest that led to the overload of servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that are tracking using GPS, and when they find them, they can "shoot" them (via a screenshot on the phone) or "catch".
Manie embraced a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifted it from the seat and women out looking for Pokémon.
In the U.S., there has been a significant increase in the number of steps an “average” person takes every day.
The Cardiogram app for smartwatches from Apple, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns seeking to "find 30", "get out of the couch" and "be active every day" fell to the ground because most public health-focused messages are boring and targeted at people who don't look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly, reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t mention here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
So you cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even get new friends when they’re chasing Pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are also those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
It's a breakthrough.
At the time, apps for smartphones like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this in this game.
The news is spreading and interest in it will begin to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a number of people to hunt for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's multi-fight gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the bet.
They were all naked when they were free.
Excellent in everything.
And now she's finally an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in multi-fight on Thursday and the others outnumbered the full line below the Olympic spotlights.
The overall score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her jump ahead of the silver medalist and member of the “final five” team of Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Bilesov<0xC3><0xA1> (USA) on Thursday during a betting performance in the final of the multi-fight of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her overall final score on the board and her long journey up to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her into the same league of individual athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her impressive compositions are a mixture of ambition and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast."
The last test was expected in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the race, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after winning the gold and silver medals in the final of the women's individual multi-fight at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was a cheerleader in the celebration of the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karoliov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not quite true.
Part of her composition in simple - the one that contains a typical triple jump with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just walk home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a baton and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - it is the result of a win that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took a short lead thanks to two turns, it was only an illusion.
The plain and simple – where Biles defends the world championship – are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points behind the bet - and finished with 15,933 points in frees.
Raisman gently embraced her as they waited for the final score - just a formality - and around the bright red, white, and blue shadows, the tears of Biles, when the wishes, which she once wrote in her diary, were fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a little paid off for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third stint with Mustafin, but then she won bronze for a total of three best sets.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "babcha", was far ahead.
After her free time, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overwhelmed by the return, which at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted this week on Twitter, where it became a complete hit, has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer's case shot while listening to music in the car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities have announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the way.
The report states that the gunman was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it is not worth the triple murder because the assailant did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $2,900, which one of the adult victims had.
The Phoenix Police Spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and wounding two others.
“It’s happening in the villa district in front of the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for the CBS station’s KPHO branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a late-90s brown Nissan, a late-90s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related to each other and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where she was later injured.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities have also released a police report on the shooting, the aim of which was an empty delivery just half an hour before the triple murder. The police believe that the origin of the shooting was this serial killer.
Investigators found the bullets and from the rest of the bullets in the seat and under the hood of the engine, they put the bullet together.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - clearly you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent found out that Edmund might never know her, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that it be placed in the institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciutova explains.
Edmund is walking with the help of a walk.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit down, he couldn't walk, and he still hasn't spoken.
But some of them are already slowly filling up.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth gives a symbolic speech, with which Edmund says "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him a sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, and post-pregnancy infections caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis may vary in a significant way.
It's too early to tell what effect Zika will have on the lives of infected people.
Picciut’s is reminiscent of the emotional tax he chooses for the uncertain future.
I keep asking myself, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And he's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
Picciut, however, has an encouraging message for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is getting better.
Know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and further rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has announced that after extreme rains, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and are threatened by widespread flooding.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that aid was already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and preparedness for a crisis situation, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to ride in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa district asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimetres above sea level could be sprayed.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was on hold on Friday as rain continued in the city of Mobile.
According to forecasts, the Comite River at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are to culminate on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said they could flood a number of homes in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that flooding along the stream in the Ascension district is a danger, when these diluted streams will flow into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level as early as Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still taking people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the survivors at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other illegitimate son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was getting closer," Hansford said.
We had it all the way to the belt.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers saved all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of torrential rains, floods are "spreading rapidly" and authorities are considering evacuations.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been heavily swamped since Wednesday.
The authorities said that heavy rain and paid roads demanded the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded according to the Tangipahoa ancient site.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been captured by high water.
In the town of Amite and in Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and locals had access to bags of sand that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last big floods here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
It seems that these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said there was a sustained rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said that on Thursday a couple of houses were reported to have been flooded, but on Friday none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot as shot", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a six-year-old boy in the city this week.
The parents of the child identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaja Brown.
The parents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including bruises, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took it too much, his little body was shot as if it were being handled," said his grandmother's station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family at the station said the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more are in stable condition.
According to the station’s report, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 90-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said the shooting was likely among several armed men who were believed to have been involved in the shooting.
On the site were found shells from a type of assault weapon, belonging to various types of assault weapon.
It was, of course, a continuing battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the road.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants here who were actively involved," said Anthony Ginaldi, the Philadelphia Police Captain.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one was arrested and the police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray gun Tuesday in front of a house near West Oak Lane.
The girl is coming back and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s how I imagine the women’s team of gymnasts for this year’s Olympics, for several reasons.
First of all, I’ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: In this team are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of blacks and Latinos at the forefront of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years was an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second brackets last year.
It means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became an Olympic champion and America was playing.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed the unexpected but masterly gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a women's individual multi-fight.
And a member of the team, Aly Raisman, got the silver.
We're witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie went the same route as Aly and Madison on the Olympic team.
They are a “final five” because the team of gymnasts at the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastic clubs, which maintain parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, training, fees for competitions, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their non-tourists).
Most of these sports clubs are in the rich suburbs, which can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all kinds of training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at a time when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It's the inspiration this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the “girl power” and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to get on the road to becoming healthy and strong.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract with the NHS being in “nobody’s country” and another delay would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with the aim of improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis with the labor force.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and there is time.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the unwillingness to engage the Dr and often with a deafening silence on the part of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise from last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for coercion, and solve the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for the weekend’s work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the chairman of the NHS’s employers, urged young doctors not to engage in any strikes.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing at all, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services and growing concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues of education and training - such as burden, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, study fees and salaries
The drug for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of re-occurrence in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after the onset of a heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them still suffer another heart attack or heart attack.
Infarct and death are caused by the accumulation of fat, which on the walls of the arteries creates a related layer.
If a rupture of this layer occurs, a blood clot may occur, block the access of blood to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue with the bloodstream, block the flow of blood into the brain, and cause brain death.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of collisions being less likely.
In the draft NICE Directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE’s Center for the Evaluation of Health Technology, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who are affected by another heart attack or death – often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and deaths in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options that are available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited over a period of three years, treatment over this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to flourish frauds in Muslim areas.
The Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, which was linked to a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to a review of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and councillors for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “animosity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that the intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons in front of polling stations and protect frightened voters.
He recommended that voters take with them a proof of identity and be able to prove who they are during the elections.
At the moment, voters just need to state their name and address.
The report further proposes to apply an indelible ink on the fingers of people when giving up their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requires the press to have greater access to documents from meetings and to decisions that are made by informal committees or the work of the group.
“It’s not just about protecting against election fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
Downing Street demanded the report as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in west London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city’s mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynicized” his Muslim community’s religious feelings and silenced his criticism by accusing him of racism and Islamophobia.
In his words, Rahman “led his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and issues a lawsuit against someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the frauds in the correspondence voting – which is claimed to have been exerted by senior members of the Muslim community during his tenure by pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents.
His report states: “There was evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were being pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan.”
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of a ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and thus preventing “vote-gathering.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more in-depth checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider requesting voters to present a proof of identity before the vote.
Use an indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating the delivered correspondence votes and the electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create around the electoral halls of the cordon.
To amend laws to make it easier to prosecute people who develop illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen to work in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal charges have been filed.
“The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a criminal offence.
It also criticizes the unsuccessful “checking of check boxes” in the voter registration departments of the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud link to parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some bodies threaten this reputation.
The madness of the cycling double Duchess Kate and other doubles known to the people at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went crazy this week to French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is a bit like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympian isn’t by far the only athlete looking for gold this year, who can boast of her own double from a number of well-known personalities – at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women’s Column compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCapri since childhood
In addition to the double Kate on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCapria.
Brady Ellison, a racer on the U.S. archery team, tweeted a storm after his pictures appeared to look like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media craziness and admitted that he had been hearing about his resemblance to Lee from a young age.
“I don’t see much resemblance, except the beards,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking image between the British far-flung Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And as we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for the change: User thinks Nathan is an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Beginning (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadala and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov<0xC3><0xA1> is proud not only of the same meal of skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Women of all ages: Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the wave theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar appearance of a pair
A Twitter user recently expressed satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
The football star Hope Solo and actress of the series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape to the face and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully broad smile, which is a brilliantly-smiling Union.
CBC Olympic Games Commentator Apologizes For Saying He 'Exploded' About Chinese Swimmer
The viewers of the Wednesday live broadcast from the Olympic Games at the CBC station stormed the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place of the women's 4x200 m relay freestyle race
Canada’s CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “tightened like a smell” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's 4x200-meter relay, he began to sniff his own opinions in a free style.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "resurrection" to the CBC comment team, said, among other things, "This little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Excessive excitement, she sniffed like a smell, burst out.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the race's second relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
Audiences in Canada began to appeal quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language that the commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the CBC voter declare that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘exploded’???”
The idiot didn't notice he's still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay race was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his resignation
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a gang of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that this happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russell has apologised on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and apologised to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by commenter MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were pronounced, she should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who are watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron’s comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night on the women's staff," he said on a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such."
“There’s no need to say that I didn’t mean any disrespect and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark are harassed by a woman who has shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman got out of the store in the middle of Primark to try on her pants, they weren’t sure which direction to look.
To make it even worse, she tried to get her size down, put on her pants, and put them back in the rack.
She continued her exploration and finally tried four pairs of trousers in the shop at Bouverie Place in Flokestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning them to the store
The mother of two children Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman “redressed again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her panties, dressed her own panties and panties, and put them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a discreet place – she just stood there, shaking like an ape.”
“Everyone was just looking at her pants again, and obviously she didn’t like them because she put them back in the rack.”
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn’t like it, dressed again, and left.
“She didn’t seem to care who she was looking at at at all — not even thinking about the person who might be buying the pants she tried.”
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home pants that someone else wore and nobody cleaned them. That’s disgusting.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that she obviously tried to pull from the sale – which is also the only right one.”
“I would have thought that I would bring home a new pair of pants and find that another woman was wearing them, dressed them up, and that they were not washed.”
Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that took place at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products in question have been removed from sale.
How to Prevent a Gun Attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, the grandmaster of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with armed snipers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a rapist, whether they are approaching you from the front or the back.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free course of fire.”
You will then grasp the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you throw it in the face with a free bow.
Then it follows the knee into the groin, and while the attacker is in pain, you twist the weapon out of his hand, hit his head in the face and start to retreat, while holding the weapon aimed at him.
If an armed man is approaching you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab the gun and screw it up so that the beetle can not shoot.
At the same time, put the weapon in force and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip and begin to retreat, still dying on it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video where you will see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But don’t forget that the safest way to get out of overtaking – if you’re not the grandmaster of Krav Maga – is to spend all your money.
Traveler Ian Wright Oscillates Europe's Most Dirty Places in a Travel Guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a time-consuming reflex – by oligating the dirtiest and most unpleasant places in Europe.
Moderator and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, for proof of the strength of his immune system surrounded the euro banknote with his tongue, handcuffed to Piccadilly Circus, a button to the toilet in the train and a Russian public telephone.
Before approaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what they are deserting.
The experiment, on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the button of the wiper in the train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem completely repulsive, however, although in the kitchen sink there are in fact much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his travels across Europe, Ian Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the things he licked left anything worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely – from public handcuffs at train stations to the laundry room.
In the film he made about it, he says, “I haven’t cared too much about my health since childhood, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple line, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after what its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio filmed a tourist film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the most horrible thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not going to olicate anything because it's disgusting here.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something they'd follow up on the engagement and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "calling Ian."
It is said that interest in intestinal health becomes a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them into broader contexts – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it’s linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in a healthy bowel is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think that in the film there is a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say it like this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted after him – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
To polish some things was naturally easier for Ian, others quite difficult again.
I'm glad we've shot some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestines health, and 58 percent of respondents said they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Family Socially Needed Before Retirement Destroyed Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needy people left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage at their communal home after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were deported from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent removal from the house, housing union officials were shocked to find out that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was torn down, all over the floor there was waste and the walls were cleared.
The family has already moved in and is expected to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the house would be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like that.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to come to be known as "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
This family is infamously known and their names are infamously known.
The couple have three sons who occasionally lived in the house, and police said the horror government that the family was working on included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, fights, and nada.
Skeldonov<0xC3><0xA1> (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease, was awarded the penalty for anti-social behaviour in June.
Several rooms in the house, which may have been demolished, have been found to contain polluting waste.
In a house where drugs have been distributed in the past, the floor covering has been removed.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, and people called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they got an additional 11 weeks to voluntarily move out of the house.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the exodus with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, we can't count at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
He'll be here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisory manager in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the police
The waste and old toys were stored in the growing part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior. Moving out is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the local community, who have given us bold information.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring with it a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove the piles of waste that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70 grams of hemp, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was earmarked for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth after moving out.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall Police said the move was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Denov and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners in the protection of our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after low-flying military jet over beach <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tourists who enjoyed the sunshine in Portugal’s Aveir were horrified to die
Portuguese P-3C Orion military aircraft flew to an unbelievably low altitude
The military air force said it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no security threat.
The moment a low-flying sprayer hovered over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting into the distance almost to the touch of the sun, people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after being distracted by the noise of jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic social media takeover, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were shocked when a low-flying plane emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese military air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to carry low, as it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane is said to have been flying slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the flight insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from looking.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during checks in the second quarter.
According to her, the funeral services most often do not inform the others about their prices or do not issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
For this, the CIO imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 kroner.
Her spokesman, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich, informed me today.
The inspectors found a flaw in 47 of the 95 controls.
In addition to notifying about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified measuring instrument.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It involved packages for urns, candle covers and vases, which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria.
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in Syria's Raksha several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raksha, which is the pride of the group in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and her family said she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that this is a real danger associated with the road to the war zone — is that it will keep people from making decisions,” Akunjee said.
The Sultan and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan's family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the Democratic presidential election, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, although President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believes Clinton will choose Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokesman later said that he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was just speculating.
He evaluated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "unleash the ship" by someone else's choice.
Garland is the chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "servants" and "post-cowards" of a Republican candidate for President Donald Trump's office.
He said Trump doesn't fit in the office.
According to the magazine Treats, nude calendars are for "women and men"
Treats is working closely with photographer David Beller to publish the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of exposed celebrities, she is trying to find a next generation of top models for her 2017 calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, full of nudity, was different from Playboy’s from the old school because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
I think the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to displaying the timeless and classic nudity when both women and men feel comfortable and let themselves be inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or in person during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys phonograph records?
Vinyl loves the isolation of middle-aged men.
Before you decide to pay the comments section with certain notes under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMen and Middle Ages, we point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so many discussed revivals of phonograph records are associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of the physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought the album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people between the ages of 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about gathering an enthusiastic fan – it’s all emotional: older people who buy phonograph records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I walk out into the busy street in Soho, dressed in decent gray clothes and wide gestures. Then I would stop, raise my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go."
Let's take a look at that.
While Soho's charm and charm are slowly disappearing from the heart - buildings once occupied by independent retailers, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and eateries, confectionery and office supplies - several fantastic specialized shops with gramophone booths.
I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while. I will stand close to the different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a Glasgow native who I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London to go out and take a walk in the afternoon.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand records.
All these recordings are glued to the walls of his living room - in the picture above (the photo was sent to me by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn’t afford when they were originally going out, and he’s buying again what he sold at a young age and didn’t even have a vineyard.
"A lot of what I'm buying is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been released when I was 11 or 12. I was too young then and couldn't afford them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. And he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that the number of customers she meets falls into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old phonograph records back.
According to my interviews, people in their collections got rid of most often between 1998 and 1999.
“Customers who once sold their phonograph records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their phonograph records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone records of a certain age.
But what is the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It doesn’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of phonograph records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of phonograph records packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are, too.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” a co-worker from a bunch of phonograph records shouts.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a phonograph that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a phonograph do not have a phonograph.
At this point in the report, he probably looked really worried when he was walking through the crowd by compiling bossa nova.
The aspect of “trophy” and revival of interest is something Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a record yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not high, but it happens.
It’s more about the product page than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a record."
These are younger people, not the older ones, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where almost a whole floor is currently reserved for phonograph records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are a couple of 70-somethings, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as the shops before – from the speakers to the taut jazz sounds the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it’s hard to estimate the inverse mental trauma when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fopp and views various phonograph records at a discount.
She's one of those people who'd rather have a look at her outings than spend it in a feverish way.
According to her words, she doesn't do much, so she doesn't consider collecting phonograph records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that, but the phonographs have their magic...," he sighs.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm pretending to be a very busy little girl in tight jeans, and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just hanging out around Polaroid cameras, and then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley phonograph.
On the left is the staircase, whose wall is covered by the phonograph records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one is looking at them - maybe just because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can't reach them.
It's just a "vinyl trick."
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers into the depths of Soho for another, there’s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area where there is more time and money than in other areas is also the one where it spends the most on the most luxurious goods vinyl is for sure.
But while, according to my findings, YouGov's results seem to be accurate - so at least in phonograph stores, they don't take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and fans who actually exist, in phonograph stores and online.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning wandering around the record store on Berwick Street, browsing the tapes, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the backs of no-brainer middle-aged men.
Gr<0xC3><0xB3>n's shark is the longest living vertebrate - videoreport<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female, whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
A French court has refused to break up shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A court in France has rejected an order from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week in Calais, authorities said the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or store 50 stores in temporary stores.
The Prefect’s office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they represent a danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations at the court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food, which offers state-supported associations and other groups, does not provide food supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there is no legal basis that would prevent people from running 72 temporary shops, but said the objections of Calais prefecture are "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much larger role than just giving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide a quiet place to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s café, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by non-profit organizations and offers daily 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable underage people without accompanying them in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying the closure of the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep rise in arrivals over the summer has risen to more than 9,000 – which is by far the most all-time.
You thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> crosses himself and volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What happened to you?
I had a double-sided pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was in college in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a crush on my aunt for two years, and I didn't know about it.
I was hurt, no one found me.
Then the wreckage got to the top.
In the larynx, the veins are damaged, it will still hurt, especially when the weather changes or becomes mild.
But nothing that would limit me, it's more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice I did not know that I had embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still five days in total.
In fact, I thought I was dead in the Woods, and so was my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare to that?
I guess I had to experience it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Just when I wanted to go back to preparing P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>brami last year, there were still heart problems.
It's all right now.
Since March, I’ve been fitness-ready at home to be able to play again.
I'll bet I'm physically better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
I'm looking forward to the part looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we sit humanly to make it right for us.
Will you raise your lips?
He had a reputation as a boxer, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was the eighth, now the second is over.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, only a few players left.
It was the last in the extralise, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first round, who's going to be the spinner, maybe we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with it, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I was a great friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
My big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's been a good player.
They're pushing us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to play and I like to get the chance in a not so top team.
I have been in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What does it look like?
I agree with him because I know him, we played against each other in a group at university.
And we had a couple of fun there, and sometimes we sat together the night after the games, so we already know each other friendly.
We beat them 3:1, immediately I flooded it at the start of summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing with an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Have you contacted an American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who makes it, so I should be communicating with everyone.
As soon as I found out what it was like as a player, I found myself on the internet playing, I saw some videos.
He's all right, kid, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it's going to fall on us.
How do you look forward to the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only twenty-four, and I don't have the guts to change it.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be a second recorder and devote myself to it full-time, and if something isn't done full-time, it's worth it.
How many times have you been single?
Halfway through the P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when Kust<0xC5><0x91> did not succeed as captain, he got injured, then there were problems with the money and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, where I was raised, I exchanged one and two.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
From there Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains the Phelps domain.
"Being on the stage again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, with his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancé and mother were again playing in the audience, this time the son Boomer was quietly sleeping with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an unreal week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it will be over, he said breastfed.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino was left, who won a long standing.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distant), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race with Phelps, another American Ryan Lochte and Thiago Perreira took the lead.
While the gold defenders in the final Royal Fifties set to a rough finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the announcement of the podium, he made his way to the final of the 100-meter butterfly race.
The legend could not be obscured by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the doubles mark - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he left behind 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third finished Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy has only a fifth place from last year's World Cup, he has become a landmark king in Rio.
Larkin was seated from the imaginary throne, the same double he managed at last year's World Championship.
At the Olympics, he won the medal only now.
Canadian Penny Olexiak and American Simone Manuel shared gold on the crowning cent.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second silver from the staff.
She won gold at OH as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
“This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become a love for them and they will get to where I am,” Manuel said.
The third was Sweden’s Sarah Sj<0xC3><0xB6>str<0xC3><0xB6>m, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Riu, and still has the silver from the two-column crown.
Australian Cate Campbell's world record holder has finished sixth.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the women’s doubles, for which it was the first Olympic medal in the seventies.
It has no valuable metal or from the World Championships, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
Russia’s Yulia Jefimov won the second silver in Rio, which is struggling with the hostility of the spectators and opponents due to the start of the games despite the doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should always answer those questions.
“I’m tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Riu was achieved only by a special CAS sports arbitration panel just before the start of the game.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Unfortunately, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
It wasn’t until about an hour before the match that they learned who they were going to face.
They had to master brilliantly the tactical preparation.
And then, in non-traditional times, the match on the small court number one started.
The first set didn’t start well, then they got into a fight, but at 19:19 they didn’t make it to the finish line.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, the number of services shown was a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1>: After an unfortunate start before I played, so we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I was hit by the income I used to get used to.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we entered them with an overview on the field, another defense and we pressed on the service.
In tie-break, there was a terrible breach of data, we put it on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Shame at the beginning of the first set, that’s where we escaped.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and the third set was a service judge.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and that was about five, there we were very hesitant.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little castle number 1?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Similar to China in the adjacent courtyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one hour in the night, completely quiet, the music wasn't playing, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
“We started training for the game without knowing the players, so we couldn’t make tactical preparations like we did for the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch's coach) caught the tactic on almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember that you would ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half eleven, but not at twelve.

Was it uncomfortable?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we had a regime shifted before.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared as best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical and probably won't have a favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Because the procedure from the group was our goal, so it's all right on the one hand, good.
We did what we were told.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: I will fall asleep from this and I will remember only positively from tomorrow at the Olympic tournament.
Big brother is here, the first lubricating SIM is coming.
You won't miss her.
The new rules are to apply to all non-Thai passport holders who decide to obtain a SIM from one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand or have entered into a marriage there, for example.
The Secretary General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission Takorn Tantasith has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures, which will allow the monitoring of their location, are to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to maintain national security, which will allow to deal with the criminal activity committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs help to detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
In this way, within six months, a special SIM for foreigners should appear on the side of the SIM exclusively intended for Thais.
The difference will be precisely the monitoring function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
She won't be able to turn it off.
“This feature at SIM for Thailand is not, because you can always be easily watched,” Tantasith added.
Needless to say, there are no anonymous prepayments in Thailand as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed a free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, however it is not possible to legally use the monitoring system.
However, the measures envisaged do not mean an obligation for foreign nationals to acquire a local operator’s SIM upon entry into the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country in question know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in SIM to their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming rates compared to the rates of local operators is so dire that even the majority of tourists during their stay in Thailand will begin to take a look at local SIMs.
Efforts by the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have been met with immediate legal criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with privacy protection, compares the system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if it is necessary to monitor a specific person.
Any misuse of the system will be threatened by an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider monitors the SIM location without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number only after the expiry of the 90-day period after which the SIM has not applied to the network, a resumption of the number could occur after 15 days in the event of Thailand’s departure.
A luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the property care there is a manager.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor tilting, high energy demands and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern<0xC3><0xAD> apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamila Pol<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Artiga studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend working with the architect to everyone if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client’s wishes, are able to harmonize the interior accordingly.
With the architect Lenka Langer, we already worked together on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with a corresponding background for a four-member family conceived as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent control of the house.
And, of course, the quality of the implementation had to be respected.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you yourself intervene in the final form of the interior?
We have approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design has always come from architects.
At the beginning, we determined what to expect from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it is precisely our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysu<0xC5><0xA1>ila, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav <0xC5><0xA0>p<0xC3><0xA1>ly or Otto Gutfreund that helped the architect to orient himself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. That if everything fits together, we then checked together using visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the realization of which you had to give up the original ideas, or, conversely, to come up with new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at a time when it was possible to rise to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned were actually shadows of the surrounding building.
At that time, we changed the availability literally overnight from the base.
Yellow was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces complemented by leather dominate, for example, on the ceiling of Norma’s dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes here or is there something you would like to have different today?
I believe that it is a modern air interior that primarily fulfills its purpose.
We do not change, most of the modifications after the move took place in the level of shade and settlement of the terrace.
Perhaps the only exit is to the floor, where the walnut tree appears to us as too tender to the house with the dog.
Word Architektek, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and MgA. Kamila Hornychov<0xC3><0xA1>, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new disposal solution and several other modifications within the building.
An important element for the interior is the placement of light fixtures in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilets.
This led us to get daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to France, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, a short distance from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I began to feel like I was dying in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I think every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are negatively adjusting in general, but lately it has worsened even more.
It’s interesting that you mention negativism.
This is how some people view the Czech nature.
Trust me, compared to France, you're not negative.
Some people may not see it that way when they come to France, because as tourists they don’t perceive it so much.
But it was too much for me.
A big issue is the need for money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job virtually anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn't know anything from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague at all.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I’m not speaking Czech, so I can’t capture any kind of negative reactions or bloating, but I feel like people here are more free.
That I can do anything, dress any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you unpleasantly, even if you have special clothes and the like.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think that's what the defendants are looking for.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then, with one more friend, we set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we are only operating in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are Czechs from half, and two other friends of Czechs.
I must say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at the beginning they are more distant.
He won't let anyone get to his body right away.
That’s quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses the face.
Here it's different, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you do not speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don’t need to learn a language so quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you had any negative reactions as well?
Maybe it's because you're a Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience strikes me.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: It’s not the French, it’s the Africans.
That's quite touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, I haven't done it yet.
And even though my colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said don't let me go downtown, they'll feed me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are in part linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like this might happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels, too, in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I had not been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
It’s not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists are protecting your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel bad and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow these reports of violence very much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, protested against the violence.
Did you record that?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague as well?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all perceive it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I've gone through another education, they may have learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman’s subordinate status.
How do you see it?
I don't think I'm inferior in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
This is also due to the fact that you do not wear any head coverings.
For example, a hijab?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
For example, my mother is a Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a hat.
She always taught me that faith is a personal thing.
It all depends on how you interpret it.
When a person reads the Qur'an, he should make his own opinion of these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the hats are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Poland for a while, but in Prague I feel great.
I can even imagine that I would raise my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for me.
The Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
The wind of the Kozelska Fenclova in Riu called for step-by-step steps.
Friday’s sea trips in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero were made by Czech yachtsmen Veronica Kozelsk<0xC3><0xA1> Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure Czech participation in the final drive.
Packs are collected as pokies.
They want to compete with carriers.
The TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are behind the idea to use the planned routes for the transport of shipments.
The idea was inspired by the life of three applications with different geographical range.
We launched the national App Transfer in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, rather than focusing more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, an 11-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how large the package you can transfer and how much you want.
Someone might be asking for a ride again that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it pairs up and both come with mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the two will arrange a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many trips it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer was in line with demand.
On the main roads it already works and it is logically easier than perhaps on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are still building trust and finding that no one will run away with the package.
Haven't you had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
Currently, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who are making their way.
We consider this to be a success, and we believe that others will be involved.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
At a large company for delivery within two hours you will pay several thousand.
You might pay a hundred or less here, because that's the path someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the possible loss of their customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, it feeds on huge multinational carriers, as well as the trade chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find tickets in the box with a message that they are supposed to pick up the shipment at the branch office, the earliest that day after 7 p.m.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that will not praise anyone and send out a competitive signal to make an effort.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, Shippansee LTD began preparing the app, which uses packages already planned to be transported between the world’s metropolises, especially by plane.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications such as for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
Programming took three quarters of the year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The Transvestite applications began to develop in December of last year and were released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The apps Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem and Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem Profi have been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to refine the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Don’t you have concerns about acting in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the dividing line and where is the gray economy?
It is the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and someone makes a profit, it is not the intention to bypass financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on one side or the other, will be invited to donate his or her income if he or she makes a profit from it.
Why do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will earn, or reduce the cost of the trip.
That is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like to bring these, on the contrary, closer together.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
People have been lacking personal access for a long time, we say about this application that it is the service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not leave?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the passport and indicates a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and credibility to the person.
The couriers also collect stars based on the rating of the senders.
We will also offer insurance, we will provide details.
The courier handles uninsured shipments in the event of loss or damage, but does not accept liability under criminal law for content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a closed package in his suitcase a suicide or ten kilos of hashish, the criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered persons are, if necessary, a supervisory administrative authority, which, as the only one, will be able to look into it, nor we are able to see them ourselves, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after successful delivery of the parcel to the hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he will say.
The sender is charged several percent extra for the mediation of the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
The courier also cannot charge that he did not deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a piece of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
Then there are no further restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, you can carry the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take photos in the package app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack the stuff if you don’t want to hide the content exposed.
You put the forgotten mike in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of an application with a transnational reach, which mainly targets a passenger plane.
At the time, I told him I wasn’t going to look for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year continued to evolve before we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we try to capture the application, because it had birth pains and still is something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market is currently not so much resolved.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t hesitate, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in their own way upgrade.
The move came about when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we are at least learning it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for senders as well as Transhipment, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The applications for couriers who want to live with it, we called the Mes<0xC3><0xAD>ke Profi.
So, can anyone afford to go out and pick up the packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will download in Prague such as a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
As now everyone's messing with those pokies, they can collect this in exactly the same way.
One sees where there are orders around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and shipments.
It is set up cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface, which will be key for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to charge them for the use of the service every month.
Are you currently working full-time on the project?
It makes it difficult for us, but we normally have it at work so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
There’s not a strong international investor behind us, we’re two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other got into it with other ideas and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to be able to compete with us not the Czech market, but who should, with the forgiveness of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The storyline of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring an almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be, according to the first information, more extensive than in Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network jamming in the first part.
Therefore, one can look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on just the reverse movement.
They will remind the platformers and include the curbs.
Therefore, double jumps, running on walls and a rope slide are essential to overcome them.
In some cases, enemies will also need to be eliminated.
There will be no shortage of maps resembling a maze and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and dry the platforms and close a huge door.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between a furious action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We'll play as Jack Cooper's pedestrian dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimoso, is stranded on the alien planet Typhoon, inhabited by hostile soldiers.
And there will be no wild beasts to him.
Lastimosa also sustains fatal injuries in an accident, and Cooper is tasked with commissioning the captain's titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Also important will be Cooper's calls with the titanium.
It serves players as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, the robot’s isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium will dryly name all the injuries that Cooper is at risk at the planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to assess the result in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions of the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand revives, but the original publishing house remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publisher THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
For example, Nordic released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games will be created for the publisher and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a 20-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried for a longer time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, maybe her type, 'cause she was walking with a similar guy in front of me.
She was completely mad at him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, a love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched it all.
He then left work regularly at half-quarter, and so she always left at three for shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
I later found out they were meeting him at the bar, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to land them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife has thoughtfully controlled me.
She soon found out to me that I was in control, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a baker.
My neighbors told me they knew about it, too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke down, it would be bad.
The fact that everyone in the family was affected, only her daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one time I went to his apartment to get some help with laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting my wife, and that he was testifying to everything.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, scratched his shoulders, looked at the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife at the time on the way out of the store.
I told her that, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn’t respond and didn’t tell me anything either.
No one told me at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been around much, who has a problem getting to know someone, that's finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was still hoping that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her and life would go on.
That's not what it was.
And I've never really matched up with it.
I still have it in me today.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a workaholic.
She always tried to make me have no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that she is also good.
But sometimes I'd like to hug her, hug her, and she won't let go.
Together, we go for walks and shopping, and everyone thinks about how happy we are in a marriage.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, it's her God.
And I don't like that kind of life.
Already when it started and I wore it very badly, I told her once that I didn’t want to live and asked what she would say to me if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France steps up its fight against radical Islamists and calls for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where money often comes with preachers suffocating with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution replaces the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it was intended to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was hit by internal disturbances, and therefore never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The former Minister of the Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chev<0xC3><0xA8>nement, known as the defender of the secular state, will be the head of the new foundation.
In France, there are about 2,500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering this step for several more decades.
This week, the German police also intervened against the jihadist cleric.
Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Shortly after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France about a new institution that would replace a non-functional foundation.
All of this has accelerated further terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of the mixes from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get the funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. meat derived from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food sellers for granting permission.
Some of the money would then travel to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French travellers who travel to Mecca.
Every year, around 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia for a traditional trip to France.
In addition, in French mosques, only preachers who have gone through educational programs at the local universities should be affected.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
“We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“In France there is no place for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, according to the Independent newspaper.
The shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left the garage spaces in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and for a man in critical condition she had to take a ambulance.
The act took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce between the two partners.
Wraps with peas, wakam sauce, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-eatable food, but we Czechs are rebellious and we have our taste and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled sausages, bacon, pork coriander.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even so sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one needs to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to do well with dishes that special tableware, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or stew anything.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it’s homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a few well-crafted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic dish.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
This is where even more time-consuming cooking and freezing of rice falls.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it only depends on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not like a fox.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine is that the raw materials are already commonly available.
Including a loaded sweet-acid charm, which is one of the basic flavors of accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharpness and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several types of vinegar and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of the corresponding size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is finished.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures for serving and decorating meals as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as a "help" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes that pack in them similar to in alobala.
The banana leaf then gives the food a specific taste.
You can buy in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of the green, and therefore healthy - unscathed and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad made from wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Who often cooks her or prepares sushi, will probably know a lot of crazy.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of sea buckthorn, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaf <0xE2><0x88><0x92> i.e. the plates intended specifically for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green pea growing in the waters around Hokkaid<0xC3><0xB3> Island – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the Nori pea.
By the way, who wouldn’t know the miso soup with wakame, Asian women are reportedly using it for recovery after childbirth.
And in any case, this pea has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
Dried and melted wakame also serve as spices, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh peas are first allowed to simmer in water, then rinse, put in hot water and cook for half a minute.
They then cool in ice water, cut off the central ribs and continue to adjust, such as as a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
It is therefore only left to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-term bomb.
If you resist and do not bring an extra grilled beef.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special raw materials and a bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that combines tastefully.
And it's done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green peas, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g walnuts and 60 g sweet chilli sauces.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoon of black sesame, a spoon of srirach chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of loaded ginger, a little pine nuts.
Let's get the threads ready first.
Wet the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, cook the pears for a short time, after about three minutes, let them quickly cool in ice water, so that they do not lose color.
On the allowed paper, put the filling from the vegetable and wrap.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, baking powder, and salt.
On the banana leaf, add the pears, add the threads and finish the whole meal, decorate with a variety of wakame, a loaded fence, a manga sheet, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-game rugby, Fiji picks gold
Britain's impressive performance in seven-game rugby ended with a devastating trail on the last hurdle, Fiji defeating in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master lesson in processing, folding, swings, supporting game, running on the line and brutal force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unsurpassed price of consolation in the form of a silver medal – for Britain’s third in a given day – and the British could be at their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-game rugby pride, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The outright victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals the same day may have been frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in its form in full health.
It won’t be comfortable for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the Fijians’ main coach is Ben Ryan, former England boss at Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has made a lot of progress.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is indisputable.
Fiji began magnificently, the British passages reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the rest of the team, it was like running behind a number of moving buses, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Osei Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which was the conversion.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoring a third, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalu threw the touchdown to the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after returning and there was still more than 1 minute left in the hours ... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then passed through the tiny Britannia and reached the line where he was suffering.
After the conversion to state 29:0 followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji were born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning how to transfer.
That's the way it is.
The British made a lot of changes after halftime and stopped the Fijians' effort... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant game of Fiji, Joshua Tuisov went on.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, throwing a touchdown in the left corner to raise the ann 36:7. But the match was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans sang, waved flags and danced on the ochos.
It was difficult not to admire the Fijian approach as a whole.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame made another attempt to win the Fijians.
She called the whistler, the Fijians were afraid, and the British fell to the lawn completely stunned.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom beat South Africa in the close semi-finals - a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown led the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard-working foot, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late Marcuse Watson, Anthony's brother from England's fifteenth team, secured a victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the coach's fight with cancer to win the ice skating race
In these Games you will not find more emotional gold - and that is what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punitive breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two cheers, there were three voices in the boat. When the ship swirled across the plane facing the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's doubles race, there was still the voice of still present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of the British sport
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how the water level flies with an elegant swan - does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every gold medal from the rowing is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which are the difference a little bit after a piece. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago did not know if he would experience this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I was suffering from bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow, it will change your view of things.
The cancer was discovered by Williams in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, thus reducing the deficit to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Worship itself is a journey, but this was a bit more difficult.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual about how he tried to cope with his own troubles.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which has a mission in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much we worked with Helen and Robin, too.
So far it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven’t lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn’t match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused on the maximum at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It is really important not to let go.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve anything famous.
We weren’t happy with today’s fireworks, we just wanted to make a good start, go out and win the race, which we managed.
The two will take a year to think before they decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her upcoming TV adventurer is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, he's driving people for free, says taxi driver Rube<0xC5><0xA1> on the ground of a felony charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate official in Prague are, according to the Czech Republic, accused.
You have filmed a number of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices and those that are supposed to be in a group that will happen before the court.
You've faced a couple of unpleasant encounters with the exposed actors because of this.
How much is the report of the indictment of members of the organized group broken down for you?
I was waiting for a trial to happen.
I'm especially curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's for nothing.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they will drive all the people for free.
That's a bit of a rarity.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared that they don't do the work anymore.
For example, one makes pingles, the other weighs pizza, and one is completely screwed up.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with taking away my freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Locking someone in jail, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should give back to the society they took.
For a quarter of a century, it was believed that our country was destroyed by name and people were brutally robbed.
So let's make a good card now and balance people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work like a public service job.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and then at the Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bata University in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, now he prepares the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises them in the form of short reports on which services they prefer to avoid in Prague and on the contrary recommends them to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series titled How to Do It, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
They are referred to in the complaint as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be referred to as a mafia?
They are such cute mafias, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia - the juniors, but the organized ones are for sure.
It's just that they're watching each other's staffs (taxis stations).
Prague is all over the place.
I followed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone is just looking out for their place, and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably an online network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official, who warned the driver of the controls, were charged.
As you say, the unwanted appearance of the street has not disappeared.
So what percentage of the Prague fraudsters in the taxi service are you guessing?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I am talking about Ales Ryj<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car he wears a telescopic shoe, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for any reason.
They chose only a few people from all over the big group.
The same is true of other places in Prague.
Thus, the accusation of seven people makes it difficult to erase the already famous Prague ne<0xC5><0xA1>var, which is apparently much larger in size.
Of course it's not for nothing at all.
It will help, but all evil will not escape, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still appear in the same places that you have shown in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day, and every day they break proclamations.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even a cocours anymore, but it's a complete indifference.
The Business of Prague Taxi Drivers in Numbers
However, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask myself: do you feel satisfied?
If I take it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and always will be, to make the center of Prague better.
And while I'm going to feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I'm going to keep on doing it.
It is necessary to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't settle for that.
But that’s not the case, there are more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say that it’s still bad.
Just last week I caught one taxi driver, by the way from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He counted 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (used a trick with a decimal line).
He was on the deck, the cops came in, and this cab driver was so slender that he was still following those cops and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi meter overtook the tenth line and stole tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the bravery of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who billed senseless amounts for a short ride?
Their bravery is still incredible.
How did it go with the taxi driver who was in the house with the 56 kroner?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss it with him on the spot because he had issued a bill.
And that will be, I think, a problem with that court too (six taxi drivers and one ex-president).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I have always wanted to use the images only for reporting.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them even before the court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver would be able to drive six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not live by it.
You talked about a trick with a ten-character character, which is being shoved especially in front of foreign clients by fraudulent taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to continue using this figurine after publishing your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show, on the contrary.
I recently went with a taxi driver, boasting in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that a black sticker was attached to the side of the taxameter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines did not work too well on the taxi drivers, can a court with their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything that can keep them from cheating?
You've talked about the fact that, according to you, they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything he can do to distract them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should strive more to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I must say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately superior.
But do they want to go against those who deny the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack the mind.
He can't walk in it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from the office of the Prime Minister Adriana Krn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>), it did not sound very clear what they actually wanted.
They once said they don’t protest against Uber, they just want to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they want more than Uber.
It just happened that they blocked Prague, and it was only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you generally evaluate the approach of the Prague Master’s in solving the problem of predation of driving?
It's obvious that she had to go to the criminal police to figure something out.
The magisterium was short for that.
They had a briefcase that carried out the information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope that the officer will be charged with the last check of all the dead checks to make him aware of what he has done.
I think that's the worst thing about it.
I was even with him on one inspection ride, which I found out only after their debriefing.
It's been a few months since the last episodes of the series were released.
What's the response?
I mean, especially for foreign viewers, who are actually the most focused on the series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'm going to desert those videos.
And then when we go down the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the very people who are seen in the pictures really stand there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a line around them to get people to look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Yeah, yeah.
I travel with services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
However, there are also many dispensaries that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
When I got into the car, the driver said, "Well, you have the courage."
Bém in disguise for an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were written in 2005.
Former Prime Minister Pavel Bém set out on a check-in ride in disguise for an Italian tourist in the same year, and immediately after the first attempt his driver swam by two hundred.
But the editor Rubes had a worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for driving from Starom<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xBD> to V<0xC3><0xA1>clavsk<0xC3><0xA1> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, which amounts to about 195 crowns per kilometre, according to the authors of the reports.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometre.
There are also other surprising amounts in the recorded reports: for example, a two-kilometer road from Paris to Truhl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> cost the tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they also charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The dirt from it goes well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of the folds.
It is not easy and it cannot be done quickly, she approached her work by the restorationist Vanesa Trost from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in H<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xAD>.
The bellows down in front of it: the tomb is set by a slope, after which it is necessary to go out countless times and come down again.
"The restaurateur should be careful, patient and undemanding to the work environment," she said.
In Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantsk, this is not far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frisian town hall were restored, and the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Z<0xC3><0xA1>ti<0xC5><0xA1>a, St. John Nepomuk<0xC3><0xBD> in Frisian, Piet in Frisian County Hall, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> Vla<0xC5><0xAF>v<0xC3><0xBD> vla<0xC5><0xAF>c<0xC3><0xAD> v<0xC3><0xBD> <0xC5><0xAF>c<0xC3><0xBD>,
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Christophe and Catherine of Redern began in Fridlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is purified from the impurity and crust, the loose stone parts will be secured against falling and shifting; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
The treatment and preservation of the surface is also awaited.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be repainted.
"Then the golding of inscriptions on marble slabs begins with rhinestones of sheet gold," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>, a State Monumental Care Representative at the City Office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There are no records from the past that the tomb would go through any repairs.
At a closer look, grab holes, drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and it is about the remains after the decoration of the tomb.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
The grave was literally blinking, Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> noted.
In the Church of the Founding of the Holy Cross there are restorers with a slight ascent as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tomb, which was found underwater, the christening, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go into the showcases in the future," Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restorative work on the restoration of the Rederno tomb will total 128,000 crowns.
They will be played out of grants, the city will not deposit any of their money into this part of the recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the 2015 Historic City Competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the win for the restoration of the tomb.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored by means of indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one and a half months.
The market is dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P 500 index, which passed 12% corrections in February, is now at a new historic high and has already accounted for 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never, in the long run, go against the interest of central banks, which have finally achieved their own.
In a situation where U.S. stocks at historical highs are once again losing volatility, which is currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfactorily and without fear thanks to the quantitative release of the U.S. central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable.
And not to either.
Although the Fed is still preparing for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week it added a hand to the Bank of England, which will also buy <0xC2><0xA3>70m in bonds in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing, therefore, pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
Of course, that’s a million questions.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is no longer essentially a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if we are in a similar situation.
It's a shame that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted to do this difficult job of an experienced politician, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, because he was shot with so many different transnational political functions, that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to distinguish from the British)
Juncker’s choice has given rise to indications that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek a form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media have adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could conceive it: a closed enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and of the model of capitalism.
The proponents of multilateral regulation co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, in response to everything that comes from London’s City Financial Centre, enacted legislation that overwhelms the hard regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, unscrupulous, and probably even careless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much contributed the balance, overview and capacity of the empathy of Prime Minister V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be their closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus - at least in this -.
It would be for the good of everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler let his close Ivanov go.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from office as head of the presidential office.
We'll take his place as Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media about this with a reference to the Kremlin press service announcement.
Putin, however, indicated that Ivanov would let go at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was in favour of Ivanov's wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the president’s administration, which is now headed by Ivanov’s former deputy Vajno, is considered to be quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, is considered one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the post of Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
A member of the President's Security Council will now leave the seat.
Ivanov, however, said at a meeting with Putin that the length of the stay at the head of the state's administration is actually a record-breaking one.
He lived in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that, 25 years after its establishment, 11 people had already resigned in this function.
The Warriors will not be playing in the finals with either a tie or a tie.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have been able to turn into a final.
As her first fight, she lost to Petra Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1>, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the receipt was followed by Czech debutists Shaf<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC3><0xA1> and Str<0xC3><0xBD>cov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the first set, the Williams sisters defeated the Sahel in the first set after the win, but they missed two sets and the Russians eventually used the set in the short game.
The second set then lost by a ratio of 4:6.
Half-success in the morning program in Riga was recorded by the Czech team: skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, defeating the second Damir Martin from Croatia, despite a layoff in the final almost in a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed.
I tried to save as much as possible, Sonek said.
It was his opponents who, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So it took them some strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, said the ambassador of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1>-Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> did not walk in Snyk’s footsteps.
The 25-year-old is fourth in today’s semi-final and is expected to start in the B final on Saturday and fight 7th to 12th place.
London's gold doesn't stand for that.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn’t go to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race and put everything that went into it.
The competitors were simply better, Topink<0xC3><0xA1> Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> leaned in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would be among the elite six in her fourth game.
The fight ended just before the goal.
I knew that the girls were level, that anyone could step out of the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka.
Unfortunately, today she ran a life race, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break out of the qualification for the second time, this time painting in bed.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points from the first innings and Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Nepeichal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes, including Czech seven-timers Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1>, also spoke on the programme in Rio.
Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> belongs to the second discipline of the Olympic competition eleventh place, Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1> is twenty-second.
Led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as Belgium’s second consecutive Nafissata Thiam.
Both have taken care of the historically best high-altitude performance in the seven-game series.
They tried to jump another 201 centimetres, but failed.
Germany, Russia, who's worse?
If we look at the absurdity of the question posed this way: German society has gone through a deep self-reflection, whereas Russian has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhumane, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to a large extent to the 94 million victims of communism, which the Black Book of Communism lists, whether they were daily individual repression, targeted hunger, incompetent warfare or inhuman experimentation.
The Nazis inhumanely exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total number of victims of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities.
In Germany and in the USSR there were not only a few individuals guilty, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply by fear or by putting their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specificity of these peoples, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came the denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask themselves: “Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were concerned mainly with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don’t want to join back Alsace-Lorraine or someone – for revenge – to attack militarily – everyone recognizes that.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive change definitely closed at the turn of the millennium, when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin’s Russia is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity, and future of one’s own people are of no value to superstition.
Fight your own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only in those decades of a despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the increase in tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
To whom does the growth of tension benefit?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The Ukrainian party has become the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia more than two years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory, and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we can only think of an old well-known question to whom does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which of course Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in the territory of Russia came already from the case of the pilot Savchenko’s well-known answer that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we were to approach the Ukrainian version, what would benefit Russia from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West, in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has come to draw attention to the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit to its residents, as current support for President Poroshenko moves by about 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt a long time ago without generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to once again boldly draw attention to its country, so as to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to Russia as well.
It remains to be hoped that all those who try to initiate an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides of the conflict and stop their oppressors in time.
For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria showed inflation.
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI index over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The index of consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the routes of these groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
The U.S. Secret Service has been monitoring Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks was released to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party Center.
However, there is no official report on Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied any involvement in the attack.
The report of tracking the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, because its expression would reveal that the U.S. secret services are monitoring the hacker attack and could also reveal the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian news agencies were involved in the attack, he said.
The new Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The material on tracking the Russian track was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called in the U.S. gang eight, was informed from public figures.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the defense and security committees of Congress.
Donna Brazile, the chief executive of the Democratic Party, said on Thursday that she is setting up a cyber security advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party’s servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the stolen salmon from Albert.
The chain's apologizing.
On the basis of the consumer’s encouragement for health problems after consuming the food Losos wildly consumed - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 was carried out by the Prague hygiene check in the shops Albert in Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stka.
The inspection found that the batches L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, to which the customer warned, are no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was withdrawn.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by laboratory examination.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for a person - the larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and the man spotted live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, <0xC5><0xA0>tich said.
We are very sorry to the customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately downloaded the aforementioned batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
There was some doubt on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, said Albert Barbora Vanko, a New Speaker.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the stores chain and get the money back.
Larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The presence of a dangerous product was reported by the healthcare professionals to the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administration.
According to the server szeknostpotravin.cz people after seeing the parasite can get anisakiosis, which is manifested by acute abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can go on without symptoms, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The symptoms are delivered one to two weeks after ingestion of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of larval disease, they usually spontaneously leave the gastrointestinal tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both high and low temperatures, which is why they are killed either by sufficient heat processing of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have also checked the salmon at the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages to date.
Currently, the unsold inventory of the product is being downloaded from the stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Britta wanted to flee Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist, who was killed in the ambush, came a reconciliation.
The expected heaven of the caliphate for British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
The girl was reportedly in contact with her sister Halimou.
She phoned her again and again in the UK and said she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have an unambiguous order to shoot, quotes The Telegraph, a lawyer for the family of the late girl Tasnim Akunje.
The last clues led to Rakka, from there the girl called the last time.
Then came only the report of her death, which cannot be verified.
Her family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiza, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in compared to the country in May, British ITV News reported.
TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS base in Syria.
You'd take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, one Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka was captured in an attempt to escape and according to available information she was publicly killed.
“I think [Kadiza] has put it off as a warning and decided not to take any risks,” Akunjee said.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamim Begum and Amir Abbas school, set out on their way on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey in the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, was doing everything in their power to get Cadiz back.
You would take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could, pushing all the force to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without the risk that they would be caught on their own, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing, he said, is that the fate of the Kadiz can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are being bullied by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went out there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was different from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's comrades is unknown.
However, since they have also been silenced, their families must be reconciled with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go after the grids even without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was the regional center and seat of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions under which the prisoners were staying were sad, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the convicts and the ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened up about a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to convince themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in contemporary costumes still strengthen the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can find out what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be allowed to lock up in one of the rooms, mostly because of the photo on the monument, or to get the feeling that prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where it is believed to be scary.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already appeared there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt for ghosts.
However, such a night will cost <0xC2><0xA3>300, which is around 9,500 kroner.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the towns also attract great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The ‘Animal’ Effect on Snapchat Is Criticized as an Asian Caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of the ways that border on absurdity.
You can make a pineapple, a dog or a figure that appears from Roy Lichtenstein’s picture.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be made immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have earned criticism in the past by accusing that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when this week’s users were offered a filter that allowed them to have cheeky eyes, crooked teeth, and puffy faces, some critics labeled it a racist caricature of Asians – “yellowface.”
And they wondered if these repeated controversial questions did not point to the larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said the next day that the feature was canceled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of the account figures animated, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter resembled painful stereotypes in the action.
The others, without the packaging, refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose photo tweet was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is covered in a horrible extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting halls in corporations to Holywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older partners — can be expected to be even more sensitive.
“When a single Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, “it’s just very difficult for these things to go unnoticed today, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhuov<0xC3><0xA1>, product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she was convinced that racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment of employees in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white, fully male leadership, and ended the article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and color people at the moment when they decide on these things,” said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American origin, “or that color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or welcome.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unresponsive.
The Company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees in that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to the spokesperson, the company recently adopted a recruitment worker who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal governance of inclusion.
Zhuov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “I’m curious if they really need other such users who can say that it’s not okay,” with their account being canceled.
Military officials have misrepresented news reports about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that U.S. Central Command officials had changed news reports from the intelligence service to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they did in the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group composed by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was a "extensive dissatisfaction" between the analysts of the central intelligence services, and the measures taken by them.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release, the report said: “The reports of intelligence services approved by senior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more unsatisfactory, consistently less positive.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are hurt when the overarching policymakers are presented with a false analysis," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
Failure to lead Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the central staff in describing and analyzing American efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the Obama administration’s top officials ordered the reports to be altered, the report notes that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom’s leaders to present a more optimistic outlook.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the central staff, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what events were actually happening,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom representative publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“This is clear after months of investigation,” said Mike Pompeo, a spokesman for the Kansas Republican Party, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency employees manipulated the highest positions with the outputs of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency staff in order to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the analysts’ fears that intelligence services related to the Islamic State were being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, the investigation must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
In the Centcom news services, there is another investigation conducted by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very tight process for compiling the assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security components,” said Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “led to overstep the outputs of the intelligence services,” damaged morale among analysts, and “failed to take into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to push the analysts of Centcom to adjust their conclusions according to “the proposal or the political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which was launched after complaints by analysts from Centcom.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he noted that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news communities and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has implications for the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now declaring an increasing number of defense officials).
Last year’s indictment, however, raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the Islamic State news reflects conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom news analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - will be innovating in the past.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State’s intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker’s team had come to the conclusion that, despite a public statement on the contrary, the airstrikes carried out against the refineries of the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group and did not weaken the group to the brink of collapse.
The Times reported in September that the findings, however, were not transmitted outside the central staff.
The commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate testimony too positive a rating of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The U.S. won in the fourth game in a row, so today will play a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam's in the game against Japan, which ended in a 6:1 win, shot three goals, and just a day later for the American women's ground hockey team shot the first two goals of the game, in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success worth remembering, but Bam's (27) said she wasn't sure if she'd ever done anything like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who's writing their own stories.
But he knows this: The Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to the games 4:0 and are shared first place in the group with the UK, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who from the group of six teams will finish in first and who will finish in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group for a little longer.
Regardless of whether Saturday’s game ends, the Americans here caused a stir in their surprise ride, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
There was also Bam on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took the hockey field into her hands when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
In 2008, the Olympiad eluded her because she did not make it to the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did very well.
The following year he was named coach of Englishman Craig Parnham and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bamova said.
In London, we didn’t have the pace of work we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamov<0xC3><0xA1> began shooting a nearby gate in the first half of the day.
India entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly tough and kept a score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunities.
She escaped to the left side of the playing field, then called to the center and shot the ball into the gate to get the Americans to the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the quarter-finals.
The American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam's.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic rush
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's an Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, you can feel a persistent, indescribable and exciting shift in competitiveness and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot rod that's passed from a sniper to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming girlfriend of women with dolls in her face, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names ring in the household in the prime time broadcast between the ad and the spots of sponsors, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic flame does not shine the same light on all competitions.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classical style of swimming - and will most likely rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point out the impenetrable magic of trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been at the Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I questioned didn't even know it was the Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in the jumps at the trampoline, and until 2012, none of the athletes even reached the final.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be awarded to Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have yet another disadvantage, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suited to the clown university than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a fan of the country.
It has a comical potential – a comical vibration of endless reflection – but also the audacity of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "scocan plate."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform compositions with several elements (salts, holes and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to performance, difficulty and “times in the air”.
Twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Warriors of the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They try to grab not only the target belt or the starting wall, but as TV news reports put it, also another line of thought: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unambiguous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting at the same time when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and of course not difficulty, but during the duration of the composition there is no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of the distance, but only the perfect, generous stretching of time and gravity.
This is only as close as the Olympics and Zen are approaching.
The women's qualification and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in Eastern Time, then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block that begins after both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you will most likely miss through other battles.
And if attention is to be paid only to the fact that male athletes will be the subject of loving looks and hugs – as recently proposed by US gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is only waiting for his new fans to breathe.
"Protestant Generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that many protesters were shot dead during clashes with the police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest that has spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses claim that police officers shot and killed a mob of unarmed demonstrators.
On the rolling video footage of protests likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured as young people are being bullied after being forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and a handful of African countries, if any, are getting such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - in the capital Addis Ababa there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy – human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repressions – opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or expelled far into the desert.
But that can change.
“When people are angry and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakdown,” said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
Complaints are many and relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition-held seat and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the Eritrean border. The conflict along this imprecise, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Ottoman Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of suffocation under the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first of these is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And while the government will ban access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during the protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered at the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromos and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amharas are not natural allies.
After a long time, the Amharas, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and took advantage of the Oroma, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that also changes.
"We're on our way to a united leadership," said Mulata Gemechu, leader of the Oroms.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which makes up about 6% of the population and controls the army, news services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to the disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see behind the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterfully able to detect initial signals of dissatisfaction and used the envoys to process and gain the opponents on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled out of relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further shedding of blood.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections, which the government took down and then stole.
It was followed by a hard intervention during which many protesters were killed – albeit less than in recent months – and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary planning of infrastructure, which is a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by the Tigris, and the hatred of the Tigris on social media became increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in jeopardy.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone strikes over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an unstable region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump Explains His Opinion on Obama and Funding IS as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to trivialize the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign, stating that he didn’t mean it seriously when several times this week insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation has raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an unpleasant situation, who have defended him vigorously in a stormy time, and must explain that his remarks may not have been taken seriously.
After this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he did not actually intend to say that the President and H. Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one-day claim, when Trump said in several interviews that his accusations were serious, on the contrary.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump’s remark by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president was not responding.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy as his preferences in pre-election polls decline.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton’s proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and said his speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses before.
At the end of July, when he came up with the suggestion that the Russians should break into Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark to the audience: “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some of the messages have a response from his fans to find out how they react, and then in one way or another, he’s ‘submitted an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a special communicator.
But I also think that he is inverse in his statements and he knows that they are sufficiently biased to be able to explain them differently.
As the results of the pre-election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has picked an even more catchy tone in recent days, rather than making things a little less for the general election.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with how Trump faces heightened attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes put his devoted climbers in an uncomfortable situation who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about Trump’s credibility of the claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, there was an almost unknown, small organization that he mistakenly called a novice, and it happened because he had withdrawn his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue by saying that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed ISIS to run and not be able to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to Twitter around him, sparking a fire on the media for exceeding every word he said and being intrigued by him.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic" television students who were trying to understand him, and said, "He can't do that!"
Several Democrats have apologized to Trump for the fact that it is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. Now it's back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bustling place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been brewing for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea hotel is looted, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new venue.
Verb started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even re-used the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
The property offers ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find dishes with brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but will offer you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original stalwarts.
“A number of original customers had to leave Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Ms. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and often went to the Verb Cafe.
It even happened when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found that what I like is coffee and culture in the Verb,” she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day she gave herself mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been committed to Verb since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"I come here every day at quarter and eight, like clocks, and they're already preparing my hoop with everything and butter for me," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new ingredient to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets himself put bacon, eggs and ham on his spoon.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and as an additive they used filtered coffee from the coffee shop.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon put it to make his new neighbors feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juices wants to stick to the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an option for the café to expand into the neighbouring building.
A lot of customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, it's like going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I miss the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the office of the President in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt’s laundromat was enjoying selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as a hamburger and a Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu on this day was more modest: an egg in a devil’s way in a paradise sauce, a potato pie and a cherry pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are engaged in a gastronomic history.
Andrew Coea’s latest book, “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food in her book “97 Orchard.”
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during a major economic crisis.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with the reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small strict buffet in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) gave her a turkey, a potato mash and a mixed vegetable.
The reporter ordered a mass carbana, which the couple said was a good fit for an interview about food during the crisis.
“Carbanets were very popular,” said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was selling burdock, liver, and beans carbana.
They were made from the same mixture and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of carrots you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe was upset.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of meals you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner was served a freshly baked cake.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" is watching how the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, fearsome point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: It expanded with mysterious foods such as carbanets and stews, cucumbers as "a terrible way to use the leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as the cooks could hide the unsightly veggies.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as a calorie and nutritional filling, preferred to taste or even a healthy mind when cooking.
During surveys for a book that contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a seasonal dish of roasted onion filled with burdock butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite addition to the dinner table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Burdock butter with roasted onion can not be combined.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
So, as never before and never since, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, chairman of the Federal Office for Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—led the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget burdens, and schlichts, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty dishes.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical scholarship.
In particular, the temptation arose in response to the government’s hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll give you a cake.”
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his childhood, he served as the chosen millionaire to become.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost smoky room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn’t accepted him to follow the example of his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all, which led to the White House “not only being served almost the most poignant food in Washington, but also the most unpleasant way prepared.”
A number of food habits from the crisis period were marked as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link has remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book they better understood Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits – perhaps why she couldn’t throw food away.
“She had a real fear of losing food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people from her were bad.”
There was an accident with the twins.
When they were at Eisenberg's clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the festive dessert President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called a cherry cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just peaches, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone unwittingly threw a spoon into a thick brown mass.
Unsurprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right farmer said to his wife, "A little bit of chopped mushrooms would work."
Europeans: Migrants go for doses.
Most of the refugees who are pouring into Europe come from economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what the series would look like if we were to spin them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us is making fun of their home country.
With the help of Photoshop, she creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if the famous series and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to compensation for legal representation costs in the case of a patent against a type C yellow person against Merck
The District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to pay the fees for the lawyers that it had incurred in the patent proceedings against Merck & Co Inc.’s type-C jaundice drug manufacturers.
In June, a ruling was overturned that Gilead was to pay $200 million for damages for the infringement of two Merck patents in connection with the highly successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found the company repeatedly drug-addicted.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive fees incurred in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to overtake Gilead, which dominates the next-generation drug market against type C jaundice, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of the Gilead drug.
U.S.-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now scouring the city after the departure of a group of radicals who have been hiding in the city.
The units liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the radicals, said Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which states that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in the same year and carried out an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed an amount of almost $5.3 million in tuition fees to the joint fund, and the former Secretary of State awarded her 3 million-per-cent grant to the Secretary of State.
Clinton’s co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, have released a tax return in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and resigns from his earlier promises that his tax returns will be publicized.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not governed by the law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department’s tax department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," campaigner Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, citing the Democratic candidate's tax return.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax return until the audits are complete.
According to Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican Party members, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions, and various other relationships in Russia.
Clinton is making a strong statement on the issue and released a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans urge Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he mentioned the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - to publish her tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico said Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times journalist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants as saying it may be so today.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year would pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Buffett at the Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump was “not afraid” of the financial authority, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign published the tax return back to the year 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid a federal tax of an average of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
From Clinton’s 2015 tax return, it turns out that unlike most Americans, he makes only $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or a firearm for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania are using a non-Orthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitation - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder on them.
This procedure has been proven by the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how to use this non-violent procedure in four steps.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is a World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... set of tools, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to illuminate the passing elephant with a battery and start the horn.
If he doesn't do it, he'll throw away the so-called "chill cloud".
Chilli powder mixed with salt together with the petarto wraps into a condom, its end is soaking up so that only a knot looks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a soft chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one thread is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to fire a firearm, which causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned into a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel at the “application” of the Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has sparked a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee based on the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for calling at the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and destroyed?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the option of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and with a problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, was “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure had been "determined after consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step of the director was even more obvious.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that Israel’s calling code be erased,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a “great shame”.
We were shocked and shocked by the events.
It is a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and in addition in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong reaction online, people called it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Hanba you,” says another post, pointing to the fact that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly made any accusations by calling the event "overlooked" and "excused" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" not to include Israel in the list of call codes, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in Brazil’s San Paula on Thursday, when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protestors.
The problem came to a head when government law enforcement tried to tear the students apart, which resulted in the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants of the demonstration were able to see how the inscriptions against the interim president, Michel Temer, were sprayed on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters marched into the streets in support of the deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate in the country decided to prosecute her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after lifting sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, the trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
As the ambassador said, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest on the part of Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are rebuilding existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of the trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent to reach $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to the amount of $158 million.
“Scottish trade growth has ensured supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
For the first time, Iran has been ranked among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be exceeded," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the men's team sprint glory hall in Rio last night when the trio of the VB team defended the title from London in 2012.
The 32-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of a brake he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend rejoiced when he got to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth world championship in track cycling in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for a specialized introductory racer, Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, the place was also relaxed, which he tried to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy the champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the first round of the New Zealand jersey.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindes went on a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped onto the podium, he did not let his eyes fall off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We made the Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted the note, and Britain's rivals had no way to appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like in London."
Over the past three months, we've all been on the same team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then five days are waiting for us on the velodrome.
With the form Kenny presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy’s day – also has his birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sports, this day also celebrates the birthdays of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
It doesn't matter how much Hoy got.
As a result, Kenny will take part in a sprint that begins today and will last for another three days.
An 18-year-old boy from Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To be honest, winning by yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood.”
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest team to compete in a four-kilometre race.
Ended with a time of 3:51,943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will definitely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he had a debate with the commissioner when his referees called him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shando, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-term Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute predominance in Beijing and London, she declined during preparations for Rio’s expectations.
In the background, dramatic events have taken place, most recently the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the race on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reconfirmed.
The uncertain future of Portland’s energy supply facility after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum workshop in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of employees - is uncertain because of the power plant, which the company supplies with electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the workshop to terminate the electricity supply contract.
This step comes after the Victorian government earlier this year decided that it would not extend the provision of subsidies that the company maintains in progress.
The 20-year fixed grant will expire in November.
At Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk.
When closed, up to 2,000 jobs – direct or indirect – can be threatened.
And because the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanches.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland tavern is open on Wednesday and is threatened with closure.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which supplies large-scale aluminum from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects some of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business shares held by China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the plant will continue,” she said.
The AGL said the contracts were the so-called “insurance contracts” that had been in force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL profits from fiscal year 2018 is further limited at present due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in the event of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate a tavern or secure electricity supply to the tavern.”
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious when it comes to the possible closure of the Portland factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
Chief operating officer of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the reality TV show Kardashian - now it's the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-manager, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand’s ambassador Estee Lauder, who showed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this title page,” Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humor in the Kardashian?) scene video, in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (barbarous extortionists Rob and Caitly and together with them all enjoyed the production of Kep<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n's classics.
It’s a covered storyline of almost every “birthday” piece of a children’s television show (Seacrest says: “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the sincerity of the drawn rabbit in the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed the audience to make it happen.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we have certainly entered a new era of Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The Vogue magazine's flagship issue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole host of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages of advertising content).
The discovery of the star, which appears on the title page, is unexpected, so it is no surprise that over the past two years, the images of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “celebrates making models” on the homepage than “models that are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar holder and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall — whom the magazine describes as her generation’s “breakthrough model” — will fall into the first category, she’ll be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make a well-cut video (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They are clearly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner’s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not there.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense.
He plays for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she photographed for Love magazine.
And in her spare time she acts in a reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid each year in community centres, and in the sector itself they are going to have an impact, which will have further restrictions on the financial resources already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, workers at risk, victims of violence, and people without financial means—are willing to fight against unfair evictions, and so on—are now in no time for help.
Community legal services, which are already so prone to cracking, are gearing up for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of community legal aid centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest general report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without repealing the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“Communication centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families going through separation, workers who are unjustly released – all of these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they don’t have a chance to get help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which will result in thousands more threatened people from Queensland having to learn about complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator from Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately prevent this shortfall in finance, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the state government has been given an obligation to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers for legal aid and the communities of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump’s campaign after a staff member allegedly targeted a gun
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina Chief of Operations in February aimed a weapon at a staff member while riding a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file that was handed over to Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer in the state on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had been waiting months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that "this will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip “marked the fingers of the gun, put the right pointer on the trigger and pointed the head to Vincent on the spoon,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the report, Bordini found at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip after a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign.
"The weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate called for an impeachment when he told voters in North Carolina that they could step down the owners and holders of weapons (which is regulated in the U.S. in the second amendment of the constitution) if their opponents of the Hill's will be co-opted.
Trump’s campaign says that the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for reckless surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news agency in the city of Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered in a short time.
A Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were a huge success for Startford and the East End.
And we’re going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs, and we will end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be those who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics and that we will laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were not right.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will be able to answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, to leave a legacy in the form of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who, on schedule and with a budget set, introduced the infrastructure investment program for <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal – which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years behind, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest ranches in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third round of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion worth of private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be there as well.
It’s time to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade into the future, and leave the legacy of the skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a former Deputy for Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in blocking ads
From attempts to circumvent programs blocking advertising, for companies that make money on online marketing, it became a game of cat and mouse. At least this is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it was going to block advertising filters on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block them.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims that the new codes have already expired.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open-source ad blocking community and those who are trying to circumvent it has been going on since the ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another own fix.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network has engaged in war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for the industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe uses advertising filters from around 200 million people around the world — almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
However, the company is opposed to desktop advertising filters because mobile filter ads on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram don’t work.
Ads on desktops still represent profits so high that Facebook has decided to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update the ad preferences tool to give people the opportunity to better control how the ads appear to them.
Facebook said on Thursday that new Adblock filters are disturbing them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising on the site.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking ads is an insensitive tool, and that’s why we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an incident in which a woman, who was probably trying to commit suicide, was picked up on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the “confident act” was lying in the dark on the road and was being chased by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all have yet been identified. The police are calling on these drivers and all the others who have witnessed the accident to check in.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, told Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent a collision?
This is what the plaintiff must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of death from negligence after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim drank alcohol and fainted on the street.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was acting appropriately and that the presence of the man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Tourist Offices and Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
This was announced on Friday by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, Executive Director of AC<0xC4><0x8C>KA.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT) closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people took part.
“Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses,” Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to the survey of the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are offered a special map of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For travel in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in staying in higher-priced relationships with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others,” Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held as part of the festival programme.
It is taught by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional walk with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna on Saturday.
The procession, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year pays tribute to the minute of silence of the victims of the June attack at the nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate 40 years.
Pat and Mat, the indisputable cuticles whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's series, directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, premiered on 12 August 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than 100 countries of the world, were drawn jokes by the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two cuticles by Mr. Ouhol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k and Sedlec.

Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters and characters or other toys featuring Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy.
A fairy tale for Fiji and a two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sport and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on airports?
This is a Friday post from the World Wide Web.
The first medals of the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji celebrates its historic success.
The team's rugby selection was defeated by the United Kingdom in the finals of the seven-day Olympic rugby tournament.
This is the first medal that Fiji has won for itself at the Olympics.
The wait for the profits of the first precious metal took sixty years from the launch of the first trip to the Olympic Games.
The coach of Fiji has a great reputation for success.
But the irony is that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike their compatriots.
“Let’s play freely and easily and see if we can manage the biggest game in our history,” the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually controlled it sovereignly, and a small state with a population of 900,000 is now experiencing an Olympic fairytale.
The report was published by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, a two-year-old who has been living without a hand and a foot for 11 months.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," a two-year-old girl said to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to put her hands and feet down and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, and doctors only gave her a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
If I'm not.
I saw her introduce herself to other children with the words "Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands," the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on the airport for?
According to CNN, people at airports spend the most money on bottled water.
Hudson's Travel Essential Stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers buy most often in its airport stores.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, in the first ten there were eight.
The ninth place occupied a large package of M&M candy with a coconut flavor.
And you can guess who's closing the first ten?
As the only one of the things mentioned above, you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Imperial Sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been sovereignly reigning the category of two without a helmist for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the pair have moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and since 2009 has been struggling with competition.
At the Rodriga de Freitase lagoon, they scored 69th in a row in the quarterfinals.
What are we different from the others?
“We’re just more beautiful,” Murray joked during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
To be honest, we don’t do anything different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable even because they are physically different from each other.
Murray is an almost two-metre-long and one-hundred-foot chasnik, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they also have a different nature.
While Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing match.
He doesn’t spend a lot of time outside of work.
Eric's getting on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
“I tend to think about what could go wrong,” said Bond, who, even at a press conference, showed that Murray is the dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, the opponent destroys the calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead yet in the middle of the track, opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We'll race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometer back and forth.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
"We know what we have to do to win," said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to re-seat the pair without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat of their career was probably made, and the dominance was confirmed in Rio as well.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it, Murray said.
We know that we all want to be removed from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if conditions similar to those on Earth could ever have prevailed on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotational speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, Venus appears to have once been able to boast a rare Earth-like atmosphere, and at the same time rotated slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
There were probably areas on the planet that were drier than on Earth, but once upon a time there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus during a slow rotation, it exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats up the surface and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like a umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than on Earth at present.
The model compiled the story of Venus in a similar evolution, which was previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas remains -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team, stating that he was unable to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Executive vice president/general manager of Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the years, I’ve been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These terms and conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his benefits to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for a Jack Adams win as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of play-offs, and during the last two years he was not always out of the game after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Roy's goalkeeper, who signed for the Blues, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil rig workers in the North Sea resume talks and cut off strike
The top representatives of the two sides said the strikes on wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea were interrupted as all sides of the dispute came to a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically took place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process of resolving current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, to protest wage cuts is up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9% less due to negative market pressure, according to the report.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide companies with room to cope with the market decline.
Shell, on the other hand, pulled thousands of people out of its payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernization of its processes – immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disagreements of the entire generation that led to the strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016 almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
Kepler's latest space telescope mission to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the rotational speed of stars from the Pleiadian constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotational time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebullov<0xC3><0xA1>, a research scientist at the Anasisfra Pro’s Center.
Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it's spinning faster.
At the moment of maximum speed of rotation, these teenage stars release a huge amount of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the aging of the star, the speed of its rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to the sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
The Rebulov<0xC3><0xA1> compares the stars to the dancers, the larger they make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that the slower-moving stars are more massive, while the fastest-moving ones are usually very light stars," Rebullov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speed.
"Plejades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars," Rebullov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
There’s still a lot we want to know about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and so saying “hang their dancing shoes on the nail.”
Rebullov<0xC3><0xA1> and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of Plej<0xC3><0xA1>d's rotational speed in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualifying Agreement Necessary?
If I didn't apply, wouldn't the qualifying agreement close and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after graduation without applying to specialisation education?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more remote hospital, but in about half a year there could be a vacancy in another one where I would then like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation about that half, the question continues.
This is according to Mgr. Lenka Vlkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
No legal provision provides for the obligation to conclude a qualifying agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualification of an employee.
In the field of health care, however, long-term pressure is being put on not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers at work, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialized competence in the performance of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, the participation in vocational training is expressly valid (the participation in vocational training is compulsory).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement to apply for specialisation education, either.
The law only sets out the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to perform the profession of a doctor already through the completion of the necessary university study, even under the conditions prescribed by the law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized skills in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice carried out in another field of specialization may be included in the specialisation training of a doctor if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it would thus be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation in a tacit way.
However, due to the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant committee of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health of the Law provides an advisory and consulting service related to the profession.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, the member of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria's Halab are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government forces), and has not exercised its influence to advance the protection of civilians, the letter to the White House quoted AFP as saying.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over the eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure Halab isn't around again," the doctor said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that from today it will stop every day for three hours strikes in the Halab area to allow safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., all military activities, air raids and artillery fire must be stopped.
The head of the UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed this, but stressed that at least a two-day truce was needed.
According to the letter, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halab, who are already controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama.
During the five-year war, witnesses witnessed the violent, brutal deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world observes and observes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly entrenched threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of them on the hospitals they work in.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
There are young children who are so seriously injured that we have to choose from among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, the doctors said.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion interrupted oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They were slapping their breath and then their lives were over - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russian forces, surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, inside found no food supplies to more than 200,000 people.
The rebels, who are under constant blows from the Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break through the encirclement after three weeks on Saturday and start a counter-offensive.
Both sides then arrived in the city and its surroundings strengthened.
