Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "seeming muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This controversy arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that he was staying with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means cock.
A Member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales commented that his entire group was "unhappy" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP's pronunciation jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option got most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead to Assembly President Elin Jones, who should submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of how they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country’s name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin keep silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people are socializing in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go.”
With regard to churches, he worries that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “before or after, they will return to the starting point.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the type of people who won’t help the sanctuaries left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people moving to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 30s of the 20th century.
A nearby black congregation of worship acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carriageway.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the track called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first rail in the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church railcar, the largest, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by church lay leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobsters season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that they had bit him.
,
I had the clavicle broken," Hammel observed when he came to the boy's side.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablanca, to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK’s beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 billion and with growth going up compared to the fall in fashion and household sales, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they surpass it, it will be more successful.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household chores.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its range of boutique makeup with a majority of products respectful of animals, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, has stated that stores will increasingly look like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further profitable these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the proceeds from pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is ‘Furious’ After Holly Willoughby Breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "crazy" after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to dedicate to the brand of fashion and accessories Truly.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "crazy" when the gold girl on television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at her corporate empire headquarters in Marlow.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said, “Trily was, by contrast, Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all those involved totally out of step.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters, products ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe the departure of Britain’s most profitable star, This Morning, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source close to Jones claimed that last night “there was no talk of business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “news presenter.”
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in reuniting with him after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a “proper response” from the US to the first steps for North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was far more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the deadly remains of American soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had to move, a national emergency was not declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” Ms. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not many are seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even if there was a prior warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure into the central axis of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the score before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea’s goal when the score was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were going to win 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' mid-point made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around doing a regatta near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball into the net of the second post with a kick with his left foot that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as the country’s emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said during a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has opened after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, which involved the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area to have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us as they may have vital information for our research.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him no one can enter or exit the building.
He was confused when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot in tears.
Don't stop saying "it's terrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the floor block.
Anyone who has information to send an email to DM <0x40>MerPolCC is asked to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestions as a “crazy” and an “intent to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking Oliver Cromwell's figure out of the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may have sacrificed himself to Cromwell wrongfully for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell's Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, a defender of parliament under external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If it is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A Pork Killer Attacks a Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a cattle rancher in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-scattered artery near a well in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs from a well in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby well was open.
He said that in the well there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the cattleman until his death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and broken,” said the cousin, addressed by his surname, “Wu,” to The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the spot.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 295-pound pig ran a cattleman in his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What you have to do is to have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave strong widespread rains in the southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five in the morning (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean are starting to generate low pressures, which are moving eastward toward the US West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to propel the intense tropical rain northwards of the US.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain collides with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible desert discharges.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the cannons into brittle rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
The nearing low pressure will leave heavy rains in specific parts of California’s southern coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and cause roads to become slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense changes in temperature in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the heat of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the center and east of the U.S., a warm October is expected, with widespread temperatures ranging 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures could reach as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average for the United States of America in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed the tearful testimonies that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly happened in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television channels.
Meanwhile, the policy was still dead and the media interrupted their usual schedule to relay Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touted her in a state of intoxication and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company counted the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it’s an audience similar to an American football game from the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s designation, was the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement reporting that it would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judiciary Commission.
As he received these rebukes, relayed live by CNN, he was shot down.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
“You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that it would tell more about his presence before the Commission.
Cable and radio stations broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which had been calling for some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, of the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his newspaper cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to levy the other’s tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Wayde's murder: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday in which it indicated that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, the Southern University police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked the police forces in the area for their “dignity and search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a last season game.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said his team is "devastating" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Cinderella from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police Face Catalan Separatists Before Independence Referendum Anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters clashed with rioters as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by the rioters threw eggs and dust paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Clashes also took place in later hours and police used porras to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independent groups, with messages such as "no forgetting or forgiveness", faced Unionist protesters shouting "Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, as the people who were against secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
The pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the referendum.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for embezzling a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly embalming a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage to the accesses and the building itself was caused.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a bullet.
Menga attack gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men rose to a position, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have yet to win a home win, and next Sunday they face Hearts, the leader of the eight-point table.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goalie, and then Alan Lithgow got the shot deflected after interning to finish Craig Halkett's centre of head in front of the goalie.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with the stopped ball games.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston sought an inning, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but were unable to pass the defense of the host and goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop for Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected a shot from Scott Pittman in one kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston play.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always cleared, and two penalty requests were rejected, one after a Halkett entry over superintendent Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
"Fenomenal" del Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and style have barely experienced changes since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they stayed short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a call to attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police allege security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers approached to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but died there right away.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Center Directorate.
The riots began in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight interns participate and which affect a pavilion.
The officers were assisted by slight facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members have been provided with health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year anti-riot agents were asked to go to prison to face a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could be benefited)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the latest hurricane surges cross the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a radius of 321 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Escarpe, Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First of all, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recuperate in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“We expect torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north to Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and will then travel across Arizona to southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger to Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects in a murder attempt after finding another 16-year-old with white-armed wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two of 18 and one of 20 were arrested that night in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the mediocrity and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "scared the messyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the “Americans saw the cunning, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most successful lawyers of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record in the service of the public,” Kavanaugh told his followers in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Five weeks have passed for one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t think it’s a race, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been dragged by the huge waves sweeping the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said in a pre-indonesian address.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s major earthquake was 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, in addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a fan and shared on social media, one hears a man who was on the top floor of a building warning people that he was on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated people still need food and other staples.
The city’s airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have arrived healthy and safe in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under a few canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the aid groups were putting disaster assistance gears in place, some people complained that it was not being allowed to move to Palu from cooperatives with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel may only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the people who were still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring some light to the devastating stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours that followed the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one verification mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves are charged $26,750 during an ATM reload in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves lured a Brink employee who reloaded an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running around behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will begin to call himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been called Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year while talking about the album’s title with radio talker Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capitals or minuscules, with or without script.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, president-elect of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were entrenching across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge the I.A.-related announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicating the budget for I.A.'s research would be a good start, given that all other countries go far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next breakthrough in the field of I.A."
Double funding means double the chances that the next major achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat the best American player in Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
"I think the doctors at I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The China State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China finances people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners in the industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research by I.A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name would change to "North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim of its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the required minimum 50% for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: “Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it is decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia's referendum on a name change that would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia needs so much, the unemployment rate of which is more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was said that between 30 and 43% of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which is a smaller share than required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, from Manchester City, skips all Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling regained Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win that Manchester City won Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defences before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defense before surpassing several more at the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems on his feet,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball well within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice ball pass on the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touches before directing Sterling to the second stick.
The Sky blues frontman threw the ball into the net just before leaving the limits.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to bring the Rockies to the party
With the Nationals eliminated from the game by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to kick the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can kick the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer out in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-wing record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump and Mitt in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, in talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not presenting myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see mesquiteness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it away.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“We’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, saying Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's abuchees.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
It’s intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of the Labour Party Parliament who are told that they are not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and it was ironic that these were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more kind and kind” policy is already more than forgotten, if it was actually applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged based on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that it should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many tips that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that this would “be fine.”
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by Thatcher’s government neglect that left my whole school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a counselor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or areas in which I did not agree with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, be it from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two trials at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they lead the table and it is the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"They have tested us in all games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot did not make it to one.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Previously, just in the middle of the day, he scored and converted a solo try, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to pull out on a stretcher, and, as the game resumed, the Ayr advanced with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to reapply that they had one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placarding Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made an attempt when he was in the back of the maul that was going to advance.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent winger Gregor Henry to the bottom to do with the fifth try of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Still Game protagonist Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the restaurant industry after it is revealed he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “flowering restoration market.”
“The sea belongs to us”: a Bolivia without a coastline has hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Marines are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greatest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice for October one, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have dwarfed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea of unusually fast court decision-making.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political mule.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear-related issues paralyzed more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends with the Korean War to subjugate the North, is a “chimera.”
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament move earlier.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit among the presidents.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or fully protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric large hats for their 2019 summer spring collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large add-ons were jellyfish with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-curricular masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more than the high seams.
One creation resembled a full diving team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
If you like big fashion, you’re in luck.
The style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the shopping streets.
The big hats come hand-stitched from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wingspan of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the walkway: a straw beach bag as big as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia flecks and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-size accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic Competences are Fundamental to the World’s Citizens
The independent educational centers in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, he comes to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can’t depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest approved rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students got an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them as a fundamental competition that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects of CTEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK’s Employment and Competence Commission revealed that, for the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they encountered in covering jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential job opportunities that languages require are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real edge in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation. Also, it was established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you will always be able to choose from several languages taught by specialized teaching staff in this field.
The independent educational centres in Scotland dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may hold for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “competences for international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason to be held Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes you will play.
“It’ll be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted in a tweet that James was likely to play a few minutes limited.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in places with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to cover the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are filed in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s appearances, who have been strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior and have been waiting for an early vote of confirmation from the Senate for as long as a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who face the November elections to take momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said the next week’s five rallies are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight’s rally could attract fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh’s media,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is left behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that they dare to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They took us six points and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three out of four points each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches with the example.
Gutural celebratory cries rose by volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in 15 was received with a similar shout, from those who broadcast that they believe the American team has not yet left.
“What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and focus on the party,” Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe are four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the bustling public makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other as popular players like Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson sent Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning four balls, after forming a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe advance by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 score over the United States.
The motivated duo consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins over a Tiger Woods that was in trouble, advancing four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a disgruntled Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a 5-4 round.
Woods, who had not excelled too much in both games on Saturday, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, became Henrik Stenson's partner again in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwestern Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two opening holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as a trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems to carry out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of disarmament first unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken “significant good-will measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there’s no way we can disarm ourselves first unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important as he has not yet rejected unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons sooner.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of termination of war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to steer North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “a rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that it was necessary to continue applying sanctions until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, like U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and unfulfilled until we make the denuclearization final and fully verified.”
The Security Council has unilaterally imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its “demands were that of a mobster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course that is taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university usually have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Their motivation for starting the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her final year.
He said no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were barely sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride for “overnight sailing” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and having a good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a sense of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it throughout the campus.
Expect the next step to be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that emit the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they will end up hurting.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's Goal Tombs Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the home, when Dolly Menga's attack drove Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to get their first away win since the February 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team eight points from the Hearts, undefeated leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred felt minutes before half time and the Rangers' uninspired alignment was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, the Livingston is up to third, behind the Hibernian by the goal difference.
Rangers may face more problems, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitor's fund.
Gerrard switched to eight of the title holders who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who kicked a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way their highly organized team drowned the contestants at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a pass to space for Scott Pittman who passed between defenses, leaving him only in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs pulled a deep foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring release.
Although the 34th minute goal by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' deep ball-stopping play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't come in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Coronation Bells", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting your headphones on, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after a erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the cap with the Make America Great Again message, he began to depoliticize against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to someone white and ask how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketch program in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not rebroadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's bronze recording to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had gone wrong behind bars for wearing that cap.
"They came with me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They broke up with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he "should put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments received applause from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, one person told the magazine: "The studio remained completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West shocked many when he went on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING BEFORE THE MUCHEDUMBRE.”
Karen Hunter, the host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted stabbing murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero’s stereotype, saying that those roles on screen often passed on to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she seems “quite important” to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television may have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "full of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard's play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so in that sense she has given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit’s character, Jon Nieve, in the award-winning fantasy series Emmy Awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are by not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of her staff filtering data from Republican Party senators and claims it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that those allegations were driven by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a tweet.
Allegedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel regarding allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Dismiss this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that not the templating necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't rebel.
He should not question the accused’s motives.
It must keep calm and serenity.”
Fleischer seems to have wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and entities in charge of complying with the law of these fraudulent charges.”
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review: Back in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody gets short
Now it has become a tradition to seek out Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems this is what to do with this new delivery of the parodic action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly disparaged we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumpy eyes and inexpressive face, has renewed his license to step foot for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation intended for non-English speaking cinephilic territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to glamorize, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a tip of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious international and travelling man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television commercials, sowing the chaos behind it.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good times.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor as the propellers collided against the hull.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps in, but the mood stays pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of “serious” movies like 007 and Impossible Mission add comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems more directed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and right as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its agents active in the face of the agent’s dismay in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and messy character who’s watching his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are in danger, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
That’s got to be the awkward Johnny English, who now teaches in a pyjamas school, though he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it’s a spy academy similar to that of the Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former bough buddy Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which he does not take advantage of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a multi-billionaire tech charismatic who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, no matter how funny and creepy, the whole thing still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drafting a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to target the savings gained by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official commented to The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t get one day for another, but the four-day work week is definitely an issue the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of party policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to reclaim the powers of “anonymous directors” and “exploited” by companies providing public services.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies do not recover all their participation, as a labor government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector companies’ shares must be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed for at least a week the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court magistrate and also raises the question of whether the results that were concluded could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
It was firm, resolved, secretive.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tangently," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star sign meets in favor of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clitivism,” which is called to the stance we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which, have already been disbursed or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with their full potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 of the country's 2,700 CITs.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor said: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved before, we will achieve our goals because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performances that we will feature at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Ministry of the Interior
“If necessary,” Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at legitimate government agencies, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if they do, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in his negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, noting that Russia only knows what to do, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve it of its function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the pipeline’s current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after holding a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The U.S. position has been met, however, with Germany’s rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organization in Germany, the German Industries Federation (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look closely at the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and for finally there to be women among the leaders,” he said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president as a candidate.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Council and stated that "he was taking the country the wrong way."
“I’m really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not appear, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
However, 32% of the respondents did support their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return with,” he told the audience who gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the country, have said."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been revealed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of U.S. asylum applications, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made a statement on Friday in which he said the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be failed under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and instead this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae said.
The lawyers also noted in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by stating that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“They can apply for asylum for people who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a particular political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced by people around the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to console her baby with fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to rebuff among the few drowned belongings left to them in an effort to recover what is possible to them.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong, replicas.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to China Daily's payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, something China denies roundly.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad publications in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press as it attempts to publish a payment ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that is taking on their country’s economy, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of mid-term vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially on the part of women, may occur in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
“In these kinds of matters it is not possible to backtrack,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation is enough to calm voters disgruntled about the matter.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate doors chanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) at a time when the Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Blaine's testimony.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation comes out of all the forecasts,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among indecisive women in outer neighborhoods and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he had full details of his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee’s vote or the final vote, not even whether they sit in the bench at Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they’ve treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who put themselves on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents said they believed Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought that, most likely or definitively, Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her by being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the technology legend, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique in the storage of personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created at Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been given the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the decoration of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", made the line advance before reaching a cannon with one hand and down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions that his grandfather carried out were “so big that I could never reach his height, but they were very uplifting.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath of flowers after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a whole privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of an authentic hero remains evident when he is shown such a huge backing."
MMA fans were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you won’t be left to see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There’s a government regulation that regulates content that’s being broadcast from 6 a.m. and this wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he will change the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the retransmission option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But it's at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our hour, which would be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans are happy and we pass.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he reached high school that “not everyone was like me.”
In Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to remain important to the fact that he won the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a sidekick, commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "you weren't socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion stated that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who has been with him for 20 years, although he specified that age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve lived so long since you were so young” (it was in your first Olympic Games at age 14 and your father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around ‘I have to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment that he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At the time I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at the Olympics, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed in the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event that is held every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was sacked by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so many times has it done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering at some moments and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and be able to rectify what hurts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the highest point in his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough continuously punishes with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer disheartening enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual matches, started off in an impressive way, Mickelson’s match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back and, surrounded by his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s mark of more Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of an entire Ryder Cups career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
"I think the younger players have enjoyed having it as a support, too this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just play.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with the others by pitching their heels for a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t stop reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to fulfill, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what their players have done in a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you test all your skills as a golfer.
That’s the message that players need to convey, get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it’s up to you to let go of your partner, go and get the best out of yourself.”
Faced with Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as a couple, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those midfield games.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressive cost increases, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement from a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery hindered the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power overseas) to be already outdated when they begin to serve, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The shortcomings in software were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff that was on the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31 billion ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>22 billion.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “going without ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old boats were dropped, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of batsmen
This new research, which has been conducted in a Scottish Highlands state, tries to figure out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is found sheds more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and helps guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton river bats and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of batsmen during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been reduced considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind,
but, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocalization technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish bats in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
"Here, at Threadave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and juveniles could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The leader of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spotted the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to get famous by just mentioning me, but it is so, I can’t avoid it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for “moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents recorded at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had cheated on that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but was consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had “terror to retaliation” and worried about “being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has switched to Juve, a major Italian football player for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK would "repent its whole life" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would temporarily stop at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact that delays in customs would have in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially regarding cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns that automakers are addressing revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the adjusted production mode (“just in time” or at the last minute), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and the shortage of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one inventory day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such controls in border crossings.”
"We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of step right now but we have to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today show.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan in which our future relations with the EU are delimited.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “possible for another week,” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before whether or not Trump decides to fire the Attorney General and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fuelled Washington’s frenzy for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he was carrying to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who was at the United Nations in New York at the time) for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" say goodbye to Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, though this would delay the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
We’re going to decide on the march and I’m going to inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting generously, although he said: "I didn't disagree with the fact that they were fanfare."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president conducts more questions and answers than any other president before him,” he said, citing without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think it’s much better that you do it to me.
We tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was, where he made an unscathed and sometimes bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland’s EU workers about fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union have followed on the way out in which she chose to make the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very disconcerting for you.
And it is for this reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of healthcare, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and crashed right there," Reed said.
Both trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to examine him in depth.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra money raised by this measure will be used to give shelter to the “topless” according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in land transfer tax will be imposed on those people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year that will go to the “no roof”
The additional money raised with the increase in property transfer tax to foreign property buyers in the UK will go to "topless" aid, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and bullish voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in land transfer tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be intended to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the rise in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are purchased by people who do not reside in the UK, which causes rising prices and makes it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major builders of keeping very high prices on the property by avidly buying land without intent to give it use and urged Mrs. May to remove the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the “shameful housing problem” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of unwarranted evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of each new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too hard to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to run Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club in the northeast, which currently ranks third in League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I just got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as leader of the Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it should be.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, having been an assistant coach at Dumbarton for a period of 15 months in the technical corps of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real cross," he recalled in reference to when he took over Alloa.
“I always believed that direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life where I’ve felt better, without a doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits at British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy, which was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still caused the pattern of the previous month to remain in July, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although the restaurants still have more.
The drop of 1.8% in commercial restaurant activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mostly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose to 6.6% during the month, while food sales declined by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth in fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that shows their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a healthy “principal” account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who accidentally ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site saw a teenager encouraging others to “violat” me.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's board of directors
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that the sport benefits from its great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the whole world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from having her in the lead,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I like to be the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!”
The advertisement of the bagpipes where it compares to mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A bootlegging company has shared public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares to mothers who breastfeed with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the “world’s first silent pickup truck,” consumer tech company Elvie posted an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers who tell them the freedom the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance track, along with some cows, with lyrics like: "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues: “Order them, ordnance them, I am feeding their babies, ordnance them, ordnance them, ordnance my women.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a big controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, except that they take their babies out days after they’re weaned,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor adapts discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was: "There was a more uncanny ad."
However, other people defended the ad, like a woman who admitted that the song was “disgusting.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still had to breastfeed, I'd probably have one.
Using the bomb, I felt completely like a cow.
The ad is a little biased, but I don't give you any more laps on it.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a lactation pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement neither the dairy sector is praised nor judged.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk out with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and engages discreetly inside the breastfeeding bra, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of lactation pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the aisle to designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Minors Discretely Moved to Camp at Texas Border
The number of detained immigrant minors has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are making it more difficult to patronize these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
About 80% of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors as soon as possible, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the reception centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at reception centers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent seizures or escape attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, the signs of discomfort in these children are overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism has almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said appropriate conditions were being given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "embarrassing irrational fears" that caused refugees to decide to stay outside the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters (linked to al-Qaeda), who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a dismissal or scandal prematurely terminate his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, indexes reached in peak audience hours have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on peak audience time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel indexes with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t figured out yet,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else you see on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families may meet, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information went beyond limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the “deep background” sources Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich leather hunter Paul Manafort (“a garment of pride and Washington’s implications of unmeasured word,” “The Post’s implications”).
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, when he talks about the alternate distribution of Trump’s show and his daily plot twists (either by getting into a fight with the NFL or King-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to stay behind.
When I went to speak with Mr. Fleiss this week, I had a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sheltering inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those program crazes in those days and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the most adjusted midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This Pittsburg residential district, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another re-election candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, although after it threw back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to bring the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions back to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," the department's spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to move forward, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next expected step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Trump’s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to appear again to voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with that I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. Only the West needed to resist him and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good since this newspaper reported that last year he had secretly suggested recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will face a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my home as an ambassador.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist at the meeting against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to score a good point, as Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
"We started the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was maybe a fair result.
They were better in the first half but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
We will have another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good workout.
I hope we can move forward, leave it behind last season and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be served, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in advance enough.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get attention, as those options can be a cost determining factor.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worth hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
Make sure you get a power of health care to designate a trusted person who supervises your health care and makes sure that professionals meet their own wishes in case they can’t communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on their behalf and make sure their bills are paid if they become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, the death toll is expected to rise.
With the communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes frequently.
Below, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the casualties occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, sparking a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of towns and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin has been sentenced to preventive detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of interfering in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and of possessing a weapon in a state of intoxication, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have punched him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Deadly Victims
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental van from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 charges that included eight counts of organized crime-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired to watch videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be removed in his hospital room, police said.
He was found not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence guilty plea without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the UK “would have left” if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been even more highlighted when a Tories group in favor of permanence has joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the plan of the commitment that was signed in Chequers amid the attacks of the Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where she told reporters: “I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers’ plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favor and is not popular among our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers hold their positions when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the concentrates that he would have to make politicians "feel the heat" if they saw that they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we’re not going to let them go with theirs.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, independent and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of the stay toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers every possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all possibilities of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes there being a woman at the highest.”
An arrest for LSU Sims player's gun murder
Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that finally caused his death,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been on the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-high original Baton Rouge player, played in 32 games last season, scoring in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders deliver victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxing and let Hamilton run in the group's queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly a lap later and put themselves behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with the almost-leged wheels that caused the Ferrari driver to lose the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clinched his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining fourth place in Raikkonen.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect partner," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the Supreme Court nominee.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and how good that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
We have filtered...? No, we haven’t filtered it,” she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did it.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnant, they don’t care who they do harm to, who they have to fight for power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the loss Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal advantage thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what may be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team eager to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equalize the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equaled the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game by reaching the end of the second half and secured the victory with his team's fifth goal as the final approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, sparking a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to strike the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people, with the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble and many people have not been able to be contacted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors in every way possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, after it said the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated healthy and saved the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be counted.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s something extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist until the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were doing near-improvement work on a dock also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended the presentation of her arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to link the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford went upstairs on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was " lying, because my van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would remain in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins in political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with a “extortion” case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg size, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for the one-day job and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things don’t go that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racists by saying that ending Maurice’s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife had sent him something I didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go after someone like that?
That’s not to say it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It’s great to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children’s book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was somewhat “grilled” after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to presume,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep pumping his heart were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died a long time ago and it was all going away.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I closed my head and the tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “Leave a void in the whole family.
It has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as the FBI begins the investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited-time, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to peak” amid a partisan standoff.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its negativity is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s defectors ‘fall’ with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 deserts last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of the North’s deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says it has illegally crossed the border with more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and is often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which generally agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will not be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives minority, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and teasing while talking about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the charges against him "gross and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that Kavanaugh could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed in office and the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be able to be in the court you’re in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to feel like everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, it is months and years of rage overflowing, and she cannot let go of it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do you?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was executive at some company and who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I kept on doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a men-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an unspeakable rage. An older woman, a serious manager who had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the elbow and dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he said.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential careers.
In 1987, when they caught Hart on an extramarital adventure aboard a boat called Monkey Business for which he had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-premeditated decision,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, it stayed behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on the raising of voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), they were attracted.
“The logical thing would have been to think he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
“You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put in my tombstone?
"Crying?"
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although much remains to be done, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, which charges taxes on half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent to U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match US attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second most powerful economy will loosen up soon.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions for starting a sharp drop in the economy in either of the two countries are actually far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the Center for New American Security Strategic Cabinet.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech earlier to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is more stable and secure today thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already being met.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would thank the aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe takes part in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest classification of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most wins of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It’s an achievement for the whole team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European team’s victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods as I’ve grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, staying just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we're going to lose him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I feel proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to tilt our heads.
We're out of control."
