Traffic congestion is a study of the activities of drivers and drivers and the relationships they have with each other between the two points.
It's hard to study traffic jams, as the character of the browser isn't 100% sure, as it's impossible to detect traffic jams.
As a matter of chance, the drivers show a bias in the area where the input voltage is present, so the traffic curves will have a certain input voltage and can be calculated by calculation.
In order to better deal with traffic congestion, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) congestion, (2) congestion, and (3) speed.
