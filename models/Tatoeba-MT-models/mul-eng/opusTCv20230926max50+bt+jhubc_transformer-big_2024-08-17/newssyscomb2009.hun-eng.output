Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The perceived weakening of the two parties of the grand coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results of Austria’s advanced parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously undermined, suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Federation for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the head of the province of Carinthia, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but lost 5.5 per cent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP was even worse, losing nearly nine per cent of the votes by 25.6 per cent.
These two major parties have so far achieved the worst results in the history of the Austrian war, and the result is literally catastrophic for the People’s Party, which is the cause of the upcoming elections.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to public opinion research.
The voters, however, were visibly punished for letting the government collapse.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were raised about the possible resignation of Wilhelm Molterer’s party and current chancellor.
Observers believe that this could take place as early as Monday in the extraordinary session of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the more likely outcome of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties, the People's Party of Austria (FP<0xC3><0x96>) had previously gained 18 percent of the votes and the People's Party (BZ<0xC3><0x96>) had gained 11 percent of the votes, but the Social Democrats had lost at the same time in 1999.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, is obviously counting on this solution.
The Green Party, which, however, was somewhat lost in popularity, came into parliament and fell back from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations could be frozen
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been declared illegal for the collection of bugs could not be solved, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be some mistrust in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherjee, his Indian partner today.
"If that doesn't work out, then yes, there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place under Czech inspiration.
After the trial, Mukherjee said that the executive power could hardly intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted and sentenced, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, which is the subject of the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
However, according to Mukherjee, Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for a free-standing position against the guard and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself similarly during the trial as well.
"He has appealed to the first court, it would be possible to release him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the defendant with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said the Indian side was already providing them with such assistance.
“Our main interest is to maintain the best relations with India with many years of legacy.
This is also acknowledged by the Indians,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistake," he said.
On the question of whether the Indian side had received a promise to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
“I’ve made a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It goes down to the wall electronic map, on which you can see Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the neighboring seabeds.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who belongs to the United Nations Division of Ocean and Marine Affairs’ thirty-member working group.
Its chief, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, the director of the division, closely follows the explanation, which he sometimes complements.
Work-life and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, hiding a little-known world so far.
Stone oil, ore and other minerals are available here, but so far also unknown living organisms, which, for example, may be the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
Larger seabeds than dry land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new undersea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the shores of a given country.
According to the Convention, such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, we consider the continental shelf to be the part of the seabed and the layer below, which is a natural continuation of the land below the sea.
At the borders of the coast, often two hundred nautical miles, or so-called "only economic zone", are exceeded," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission setting out the external borders of the Continental Shelf shall be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of cost research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success in the world recently brought about a revival that first significantly expanded its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of seaports judged for by the commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times larger than the country's territory.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits from the use of seabeds in the future will, in their hopes, be priceless.
Other countries are also making their applications on an ongoing basis.
They can do so within ten years of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean basins declared by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind" begins.
There is no longer a single country in which there is a unique situation.
The right of production shall be conferred on the international institution established by the Convention in this field.
“The seabeds, however, are not Klondike,” says CEO Mikulka by saying that “some areas have been legally clearly circumvented and their regime is enshrined in a contract.”
Czech Republic in the Pacific Ocean
A part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
This former eastern block is shared with other countries within the framework of the common "Interoceanmetal" organization.
According to the agreement, in 1991, this organization received the status of a so-called “traffic investor” similar to that of investors in some other countries.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati on the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than that of the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabeds are carved there, and the Tatra is a kind of underwater copy.
"This can be reached in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese-containing polymetallic ores,” says another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, an employee of the Macedonian division, presents another concrete example.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy with the magic words that bring G<0xC3><0xB3>lemet to life.
German special forces were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and the experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but no action was taken on them.
More and more details about the release of a dozen European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are coming to light.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue.
In addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the aircraft of the German Federal Police, and the staff of the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, are also at the scene of the liberation.
German forces were not needed, however, according to the ministry's spokesman on Monday night, as hostage-takers were allowed to run their hostages and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage-taking.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to act as an on-the-spot support force.
"Fortunately, it didn't happen," a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
Attackers from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight of their Egyptian followers were kidnapped in the southern part of Egypt on 19 September.
The hostages were dragged to and from the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad after a manslaughter in the desert area of southern Egypt.
The whereabouts of hostages have remained unclear, as have the details of the release of hostages or the possible exchange charges.
Meanwhile, the survivors arrived at Cairo in peace.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
No details of the release have been released.
At the time, there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force’s Airbus aircraft.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has received a small majority of the proposed $700 billion bailout package for the money markets.
The Dow Jones fell to the ground.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the money markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians from both parties, he did not receive a majority in the program that sought to curb the chaos in the money markets.
Supporters have been desperately trying to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic move.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party’s negotiations, called on representatives, even if the plan is still unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support for something that hasn’t even come in,” he said.
The Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent or 600 points during the vote.
Investors are concerned that the government's bailout package could prove to be a failure.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then fell again after the failure was made public.
Experts report further serious turbulence in the international money markets.
In order to enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
The directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is promised for German travel organisers.
According to one study, the traffic of reservations for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans were not in favour of travel, according to the study.
In the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year’s period, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a study by the GfK Market Travel Institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel offices in October was 11 per cent higher than in October 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on the GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the full market.
The institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States in particular was sought, the DRV said.
Here, the rate of bookings increased by one-third on the round.
In addition, Germany’s particularly preferred travel destinations include Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as its home landscapes.
Most of them were looking for organized roads,” said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to the rising energy and food costs, in the case of organized trips, the costs "can be better calculated for passengers than for individually organized trips."
Among other things, passengers can save money on booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth can be attributed again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook a trip compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Repetitive ballermann beats without a break, liters of corsair beers and design dinndlit wearing celebrities.
Debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't look much alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV presenter, and she's wearing a custom-made sledgehammer.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the turkish.
One thing, however, connects us: We’re barely three minutes away from Wiesnen, photographers are already hitting us and filling up their memory cards – very flattering, and all this is my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like a cheap sledgehammer will do his job.
As a Wiesn-tourist from the north, trained in white sausage, I still have a sense of comfort for the public.
But by the time we get to Theresienwiese, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears stretch marks or leather; no one looks slurred or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the sochiban stand are just my squeaky rope.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I have incorrectly tied the rope: "You are free to tie it to it, in the middle of the virgin, to the right, to the back of the widow."
Secretly, I put the fat over the back left.
"That's good," she says, and she laughs.
Others have less fuss around the subtle flirting techniques, and they carry a simple felt tab with the caption "I'm too drunk to dress up", and they unwittingly point their naked backs.
The young man with the exhibitionist attractions is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest in the first taste.
What you find very fantastic is that you've been giving away "aaaaa" for a long time.
He then tells me that he has been rid of the contents of his previous surviving corsair.
Right next to one of the fire pits that everyone sees as garbage.
So Bob's one of the notorious "waters in the ditch."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the rescuers march through the scene and take care of the poor couple.
Patients always show up in a team - at the same time, four shoes from the tent to the tent, a covered stretcher.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuck in a barrel.
It doesn't look like it's lying in the alcohol pocket under the ponies.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," cried one of the sanitizers to my question, and then turned around.
Police have named the victim of the accident.
Police have named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The accident happened Friday afternoon with the Brentwood-based Chelmsford Road resident Carole Paulson on Shenfield Road in the city.
They were taken to a hospital in Romford called Queen's Hospital, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's Broad Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey had intended to join the European Union, the European powers had burned down the desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with one or two towers at each front corner, and looks like a German country townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little cramped.
However, given the interior of the shop’s ticket office, it is obvious what size of business this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened by the German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation, in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of the conquests, wanted to realize its ambitions for the occupation of the Middle East, with the help of the railway leading from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during the First World War.
The railways were attacked by Arab Lawrence and Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army pulled out of Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station didn't get any better.
In 1917, a fire truck train exploded and destroyed the beautifully designed top of the building.
According to Turkish sources, sabotage was carried out.
Since then, it has been slowly falling apart and history has been greatly exaggerated.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region – at least symbolically – serves as Turkey’s expansive diplomatic horizon.
The Truth and Development Party in the government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is worth noting that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, with Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and with the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took a night train to Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the collision, which at the time gave the famous documentary about the old world, the rhythm of "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new, secular state, the backbone of which is the backbone.
However, the openly Islamic-rooted AKP represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went by taxi to the AKP's headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building specifically designed for this purpose - which stands in a developing suburban neighborhood, half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. It is to meet in the meadows - to meet in a meadow
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a better-medium-adjusted politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he had another Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to help re-introduce Turkey into the immediate environment.
The Cold War has overwhelmed the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its back country.
Today it had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to be opened in both directions.
"But is it possible that he will be forced to vote sooner or later?" he asked.
"Turkey has never wanted to come up with an answer."
He then stressed that what almost everyone I spoke to here was almost mechanically repeated: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East, but with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are equally beneficial to Europe, to Turkey and to the United.
It is as if they want to convey the message that, in a sense, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those east-facing railways.
When I was at Hydarpasha Station again, I thought of another, well-spent night, Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen, who 100 years ago had been watching the reconstruction of this magnificent building.
They would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the port for the compass to take him back to Bosporus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, there was no question as to which part of the land would be in need of this exciting country.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the music director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) has conducted the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
On the basis of his musical plans for the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, in the following year.
In principle, only under 21 years of age could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang the finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we were simply not willing to get rid of the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in accordance with the corpus' determination and ability to cope with any pack they put forward - be it a madrigal, or a Messiaen piece; without escort or a large army.
The musical diversity of such a young choir has often been amazing and always exciting, and we can thank the man whose inspiration for our passion for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it!"
The technique of karmaster has always been completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
Whatever the music level was, he was always up to it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there was ever a driver who was supposed to be hit by a horse, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well in the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty years, I have written reviews of more than 100 concerts, but I have never been disappointed with them, and I have often been impressed with them.
With Tod Handley, there was greatness and humility, which is very rare.
He hated those conductors who, living by his words, simply "were galloping through the whole world with one or two well-known fighters."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) "He continued his economic history studies at Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became a Fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute ... while he was continuously preparing for his undergraduate, master's degree and Ph.D. degree."
It comes from the author's notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economics at the University of Nottingham, and, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he was a Houblon-Norman scholarship holder in the United States, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not clear why Woodruff made his career better this season.
J. Vicente Resino in the Magician
I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black-and-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength flowing from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photos, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is influenced by the emotions.
Resino has come to immortalize the magical moments.”
Second-time sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of Jazz.
True, his predecessor was already quite large, but the design of the interior of the new model was even wider than that.
All of this is paired with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel-savings.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is what the second generation of Honda Jazz looks like.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the new Jazz scene, a number of internal changes have been carried out on it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we go into the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation.
So for the first time, we can conclude that Honda has succeeded in renewing this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less well-known, but it sets sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, in Japan, where in 2002 and later this year Jazz was the most sought-after automotive brand.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since they entered the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz in 2007, by 2009 it is expected to sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 pieces of Jazz on the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated with 2000 copies sold during the one-year divestment.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease the decline of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The company’s representatives are predicting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is a decrease of 16% compared to the 2007 figures.
Despite sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% from 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes that this will be achieved with the introduction of a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-wheeled and compact 4370 mm-long hybrid, from which the Japanese company will distribute 200,000 pieces a year in a global ratio.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50 percent of Insight’s market share would be made up of the United States, while the remainder would split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight after the official Valencia presentation scheduled for January, will take place in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider in all respects.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and its wheelbase increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to its size, the passenger area has become wider.
The larger interior is guaranteed on the one hand by the new body, on the other hand by the fuel tank in the middle - this solution can already be known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total storage capacity of the so-called double-storey container has grown, currently 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters, exceeds the capacity of the first generation.
Although these dimensions relate to the type fitted with the 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz’s pack capacity is 379 liters.
Some exterior modifications can also be discovered, such as the back of the glazed lamps or the optional panoramic glazing, as well as the easier accessibility of the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of sales, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4-litre engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both sources is more favorable than the previous model, as well as lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical consistency, while at the same time the engine has a high performance in all respects.
The power output of the 1.2-litre power supply is 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine - which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower from the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower 1.4-horsepower Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The anti-counterfeiting "killer"
For the development of accident-preventing technologies, this time Nissan is inventing a new inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the theft of bees to avoid accidents.
It may be that a device called Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Chief Technology PR and Research Brand Officer, the BR23C represents a further expansion of the Nissan’s four-level safety bumper.
The robot makes the company’s products more comprehensive in their combat-avoidance capabilities.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety fuselage.
However, much more important is the role of the complex eye of the bee, with which it sees in all directions at more than 300 degrees. As a result, the bee can crawl undisturbed in its own personal area.
To print out the function of the complex eye, the engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
The instrument identifies the obstacles within a range of up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately forms an operation to avoid the collision.
“As the obstacle is detected, the small robot, following the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle in order to avoid collision.
The system is most different from the currently available tools, in which case the avoidable manoeuvr is completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the circumferential manoeuvr cannot move upwards or downwards, nor can it move transversely, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in the infinite direction and in the way that occurs in the case of bees.
That’s why Nissan also used a rotational function in the robot to avoid collisions in addition to acceleration and deceleration.
“This structure only needs to process the data every few seconds and respond to it.
There is no need to store the data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvrings, so it can work without interruption with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it’s not really a gigabyte, but we’re not even talking about megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step in the development of the technology for immediate collision prevention, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, can become part of the series-production cars within ten years.
The robot operates lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, further application options may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to get the car to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the signpost
We must recognize that the U.S. Department of Commerce, in addition to having a lot of money to invest, does not have a reasonable understanding.
Because of the crisis on their necks, and the fact that Americans are not being called into question by pay-as-you-go signage banks, they have created an entertaining and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
This is the "Bad Credits Hotel"... that is, the gibbons.
The description of the accommodation, and especially the reception desk, suggests that we think again, twice, even, more than three times, whether the time for taking out the loan has really come.
And especially where we need credit, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for the gamblers than the general public.
But what would happen if we complemented the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, that's something, because we don't have to dream about buying an apartment...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it is providing equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank is paying $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley’s share price fell sharply.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price remains more than 19% of the value of the securities according to the book of 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide a 10% return, and its conversion rate is $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, when the global transaction is executed, it is based on a 29-dollar average exchange rate, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock price rate fell by 6.79% at around 17 hours according to the Greenwich median, closing at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a banking company,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group of companies.
Morgan Stanley last week approved the new status, which allows him to diversify his activities, while at the same time being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the companies listed on Wall Street.
By the way, the terms announced on Monday show that the deal has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely tribal,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
“However, due to the current market and economic situation, we would like to minimise and protect against possible risks.”
With regard to the weighted average, MUFG pays 7% more for Morgan Stanley shares than the book’s value.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a share is reduced by about 20%.
Under the agreement, the MUFG may convert half of its priority shares to tribal shares within one year if the latter's trading rate exceeds the conversion rate of more than 50% over a given period of time, i.e.
Morgan Stanley ensures that with the help of funds from MUFG, you can take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group’s spokesperson did not wish to provide accurate information on the two new federal strategic plans.
Following MUFG’s integration, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I pay capacity by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan stated that his balance has "definitely" improved since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great test for the group, as the stock exchange has fallen by half, while the cost of securing against the non-payment risk has skyrocketed.
This cost was moderated on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Only one of the big investment banks left the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers after the collapse and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is the Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had reached $15 billion in cash from Warren Buffett.
Statement by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
The re-establishment of the Republic in the spirit of 21st-century socialism.
This is a joint plan for Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following a sample of his colleagues and friends, Correa expressed his ideas on the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully completed his mission, as 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results, which accounted for 80% of the votes.
According to the census, 28% of the population voted in favour, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes were cast in full.
It took 50% + 1 vote to adopt the draft constitution.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations’ exits, and one civil organisation’s tally of “yes” votes, showed a huge turnout of 63% or 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, talked about the victory of his draft constitution from Sunday to Monday night.
"The constitution has achieved an overwhelming victory," he said, and in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, at the governor's seat of government, he thanked the Ecuadorians.
As is well known, Rafael Correa’s Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet congratulated him.
According to a report by the Observer Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, while maintaining the right of the state to "plan for development" for a country that is essentially based on oil production by foreign companies and on the currency sent by the emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can hold a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to live with this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will compete again for the presidency.
The constitution also included the freedom of health services and education. The president has already begun to introduce it in a country with a population of 13.9 million and half the population lives below its subsistence level.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the use of the Ecuadorian facility, which is the basis for the Quito-Washington Agreement.
19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the human traffickers, who had taken 11 tourists and eight of their followers hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now staying in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained for ten days in the desert, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad by an Egyptian commando during the morning.
Apparently in good condition, around half past four in the afternoon, they arrived by plane at al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to report to the press, and were immediately transported to a hospital in a suburb of Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy", and the kidnappers "did not pay a ransom", Egyptian Foreign Minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured at the foot of Mount Ouana on 19 September in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in an off-road safari. The group was then dragged from one of the 35 unknown hostage hiding places to another.
The group had 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptian: two foreign drivers, four drivers, a border guard and the head of the travel office of Aegyptus, the organiser of the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a special commando of 30 arrived on two helicopters at the site, where they crashed directly into the hostage-takers in front of a power train.
"There was a firefight between the teams, half of the men were killed, the rest fled," the leader said, calling for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special divisions had been sent from the Egyptian Villam Brigade to Sudan, where they were supplemented by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomatic leader, Franco Frattini, who is based in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to recognize that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and action groups," he said, without giving further details.
He also denied that the hostages had been paid a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had arrested a fieldman during surveillance, on which the kidnappers were traveling, killing six of them (including the leader of the Chadian army), and arresting two.
According to the army, the hostage-takers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization in question immediately denounced.
Lettres - The "silent majority of culture"
The focus of the press and the election campaign that is taking place is currently on the issue of funding culture.
We can only be happy about that.
But they still forget about a part of our cultural life.
Who is going to raise their voice to highlight the ridiculous amounts of small museums, bookstores, archaeological excavations and national historical sites that are on the brink of starvation?
What political mermaid reminds the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and buildings that form part of the cultural heritage?
Or the fact that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau Chinon in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all government bodies in a coherent manner.
Within the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers from the Association of Quebec Historical Societies (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec) are engaged in the research and development of history.
Often, these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth and claws, and with the last strength of the floodgates, when property developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of the historical and cultural heritage?
Fortis Bank is a part of the Benelux governments
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux states will help the Belgian-Holland bank, Fortison, which has been in trouble - as the first European - due to the looming impact of the US credit market crisis: the three countries are supporting Hungary's security interests by a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed on the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competitive responsibility.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of an international financial market crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the bank’s case can therefore be considered to be somewhat unprecedented.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, almost half of all three states (49 percent) purchase the bank’s existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Dutch company ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3> last year - especially its insurers.
Shares of Fortis began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious crises at the institution.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s papers fell by about 12 percent on Friday, down to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
With regard to the current stock markets, the total market capitalization of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company managers, this is not realistic.
The company's management, however, caused market uncertainties over the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan due to the collapse of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were already slightly up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to head the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but no one has applied for it with a merit offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients so far, the accounts have not been rigged.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and has also purchased licensing companies.
Rocks in the pond
In the U.S., life and health insurers are often denied, based on people’s drug purchase data, to sign an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts believe that the data market is becoming unchecked.
"There is a data protection program that involves the use of the drug analysis data in all cases for the consent of the data subject.
It has to be in independent hands, otherwise we'll rely on the shark," said Richard Dicket, the developer of a program that's suited to follow drug trials at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance premium and the amount payable in the event of damage depending on the health status of the applicant customer, and if the risk is judged to be too high, they shall not be bound by insurance.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacies to the customer's identification number, it is easy to obtain what medicines he has bought in the last one and a half years, and from this the program itself determines what kind of disease
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol-lowering, it suggests that your blood fat levels are practically unmanageable, which immediately falls into a higher risk category.
Several versions of the program are also on the market, some at the same time determine the number of risk pressures, so the insurer has little to do outside of the paperwork, although small difficulties are encountered.
One of the drawbacks is that some drugs can also be used for a number of purposes, for example, some compounds can also be used against migraine or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor in terms of business insurers, and the former is not.
For the collection and processing of the data, separate companies have been formed, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient's consent.
The authorities are now obliging them to do so, although no punishment has been imposed for their omission so far.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory tests and are also linked to the drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the patients’ health status.
More and more companies are accessing the data, and it will be increasingly difficult to control the usage at the same time.
There are separate health data protection laws, but they only apply to health providers and insurers.
Before the congress, there is the legislative proposal, which also gives the authorities control over the companies that specialize in the provision of data.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program, which would bind the transmission of data to the express consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the data subject cannot refuse consent, otherwise the insurers do not enter into a contract with him.
So then, the caterpillars are still referred to the welfare of the fox.

Doubles trade between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit also underscored this issue, along with the other, largely global problems.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will mainly be discussed.
The European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic superpower that should be given a greater voice in international affairs, but Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator if they support the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council in New Delhi.
This issue was thus not raised at the Marseilles held yesterday, and is now in its ninth summit.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the President of the European Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Minister Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the number of votes in five years, i.e.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange rate increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements existing with India have been summarised in a legal sense, i.e., air traffic may also fluctuate in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth in the list of EU partners.
The summit has paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, have been condemned in all its forms by both sides and have urged the United Nations conference to be convened.
The completion of the Doha trade round was also hampered, although both of them have a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that, alongside its sustained energy and climate programmes, it wants to reduce emissions of pollutants by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India has also agreed to this, as well as to conclude a global deal at the climate conference next year, and to moderate the production of greenhouse gases by 50 per cent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is heading to the French capital today, where he is preparing to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they are confident that the French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian bookshops in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair with a strong field.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, at the 60th Buchmesse fair.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will host 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, covering an area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The award-winning guest will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Java and Activities: Italy, through the establishment of a single Italian Bridge, will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Structure" of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, which will also provide an opportunity to present data, trends and views on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the area of adult and youth publications.
One year ago, billionaire Steve Fossett's plane was found.
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane were found missing over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, bordering California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, all of the doubts that still exist have been dispelled: "After determining the status of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the plane that Steve Fossett went missing on the day of his disappearance."
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigation committee was called in to identify the aircraft and determine that it was indeed about an 8kcab from the wreckage, which occurred on April 3, 2007.
Also yesterday in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some personal belongings near Fossett's home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two certificates in Fosset's name, issued by the Federal Air Force in Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
Fosset's search was abandoned after a month of disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of summits through which he has written himself into history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he managed to circumnavigate the earth with a balloon for the first time: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he also flew over the ground without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes, at an altitude of 15,445 meters, carried out by a second pilot.
GLK, amazing advertising
An unusual, yet original and determined form-world hobbit track, with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact SUV” with which the German carmaker tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
That’s why the launch campaign of the SUV GLK, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will be surprising and unusual.
Because the advertising campaign that accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle lives with this hitherto unknown media communication device, among other things through utopian 3D posters that have not been used by the car brand in Italy.
The giant plaque action, which consists of three stages, will rule Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Com<0xC3><0xB3>t, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the introduction of the car’s volume, in which the new SUV, in the Corso Como area, uses special glasses, in almost real sizes and in a three-dimensional low.
The image will make the viewer feel as if the car is standing out from the poster.
After that, thanks to the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible, and then it is assembled into a single image.
There is no doubt that with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the world of automotive stereotypes.
Is it possible to attract the attention of future customers? We will see.
We'll show you who the Italian football fans are.
Young people in Trivenet, they're probably excluded from the fields.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of the whole of Italy? Members of the group called "Ultras Italia", who have been following his selection for years, and who, in truth, has not caused too much trouble until now.
They never clashed with the enemy's cheerleaders.
The group's core is on the right.
The main organizers are from Trivent<0xC3><0xB3>.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined by smaller, scattered groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (actually only a few units).
Italian flags were flown, on which were displayed the hometown of the fans: on Saturday they were taken away so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were confronted by a real Nazi team of snipers, the Levski printers.
The Italian Football Federation issued 144 tickets to the Italian fans, which were tickets to the name, making it easier to check on the fans' team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was not one among the makers in Sofia who was in the process of being tried, no one who had been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian strikers, who have a priori in football, have denied the ticket and the exit.
The Interior Ministry is currently waiting for the minutes from the Sofia police, and then will take the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the riots can also be subjected to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visiting all the stadiums in Italy, but also to all the stadiums in Europe.
So our football fans can't put their foot in a single football field.
Oh, good luck.
But we also need to keep in mind that the Huligans find followers, that is, that they join the few hundred and fifty chiefs.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, it must not be saved by those who behave in this way," the Interior Ministry said.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s day is almost here in Lecce.
There is a small cell in the puglia that supports Italian ulcers.
The Observer Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Committee for the Analysis of the Safety of Sport Events, which may also be part of the internal security service, for intelligence services dealing with the behavior of the spectators.
"Duke Duce's scandal and a flying arm under the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
This idea was elaborated, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to the head of the observation service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente, before by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the Chief of Police of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italian group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims to be true is not forbidden in Bulgaria to live the Duke, but from this the behavior of the 150-200 cheerleaders was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, the first person in the observational service has added, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime is committed.
So far this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s talk a little bit about the Italian anthem being played out: it’s not a crime, but if I may say so, it’s not a virtue.”
