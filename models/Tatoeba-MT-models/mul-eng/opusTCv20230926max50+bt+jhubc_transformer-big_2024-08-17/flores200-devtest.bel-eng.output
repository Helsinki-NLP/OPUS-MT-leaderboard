This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also gives information that is usually not obtainable by studying fossils, for example, about the color and the three-dimensional space of the feathers.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brown-brown at the top and had a pale or red-yellow hue on the reverse side.
This discovery makes it possible to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the fact that the feathers of the dinosaurs do not have a well-developed trunk — a rhizome, but have a second species of feather — the owls and beards, the researchers concluded that the rhizome was probably a late evolutionary change compared to the second.
According to the structure of the feather, it can be concluded that it was used not for flight, but, rather, to regulate the temperature or pay attention to itself. The researchers allowed that even in the past, because it could be a tail of a young dinosaur, it could not fly on the fly.
The researchers allow that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, in the pattern you can see the appearance of an adult animal, not the smoke of a bird.

Gold can be cast in various shapes. It can be cut into thin sheets.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which then has no problem twisting and braiding. You can, in addition, unscrew it or slip into the letters.
It can be made very thin and attached to the second metal. It could be so thin that from time to time with its help the illustrations painted in the books —the so-called “sacred manuscripts.”
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical. You can independently make such an acid-base indicator with the juice of a reddish-brown cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or elasticity of a certain thing.
The level of pH in the trace chemical is determined on the basis of the number of ions of hydrogen (liter "N" in pH).
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

The rocket was used to send into the space of the satellite. Scientists have to use telescopes in space, because due to the impact of the Earth's atmosphere, the light breaks and the picture is told.
In order for a telescope or satellite to get into space, it is necessary to have a massive rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the light in an incredible way. The easier and faster movement is the biggest of what the wheel has done for us.
As a result of this, we have a lot of cars, trucks, and other vehicles.
Below are cats of medium size. Their prey is also of medium size — they are hunted both on the cocoons and on the antelope with allenas.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including housewives on a free trip) hunt and eat more small prey — insects, insects, owls, and birds.
The secret of their success is that everyone occupies their niche, i.e. has only its function, and therefore it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most companion cats: they live in large enclosures, which are known as prairie.
The parade can include up to three adult males, who are relatives, as well as up to thirty males and a child.
In most cases, women are close relatives, forming a large family with siblings and a daughter-in-law.
The behavior of lions has passed and the breeding of wolves or dogs is much similar. The latter can be strongly reminiscent of lions (but not of other large cats) in that they pose a deadly danger to the breed.
The game is capable of sinking (but not so well), jumping over a great distance, swimming and pulling with force five times stronger than a strong man, as well-prepared sportsman.
The tiger belongs to the same group with lions, leopards and jaguars (a breed of panther). No other kittens, except these four, can not scream.
The tiger's roar is more like a fairy tale, which consists of sharp and loud words than a full-fledged lion's roar.
Acelots are used as food for small animals. If there is such a possibility, they hunt for monkeys, insects, snakes and birds. Almost all the animals on which it hunts are much smaller than acelot.
According to scientists, wholes are tracked and found to produce a smell, smelling traces on the ground.
Thanks to the night vision, they can see well in the dark and very confidently move. They burn the acelots, merging with the surrounding environment and from hiding attacking their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they come (e.g., when moving through cancer or mountain masses, or if such living beings migrate to a new island, then they will return to the mainland), then they will return to the mainland.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need other features or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to be adapted.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to a new environment, animals are increasingly resembling the main population from which they have separated themselves.
It will be thousands or even millions of years and sooner or later the two populations mentioned will look to such a degree differently that no one will ever intend to add them to the same species.
This process we call the discovery, which in fact means the emergence of new species. The discovery is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe. They, in addition to this, consume the carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants "cook" themselves food from sunlight through photosynthesis. In addition, they give shade.
We build from the plants of the house and make from them clothes. We eat mostly plants. And animals would not survive without plants either.
For their time, the Mazazaurus were superstitious, so they were not afraid of anything and no one except the other Mazazaurus.
On his long scissors, over 70 oysters were decorated as a brush of teeth, and at the top of the mouth was another additional tip. This meant that his gains would not be able to be saved at all.
Exactly not known, however, it is possible that he had a double tongue. The ration of massaurus consisted of large fish, socks and other masaurus. It is likely that they could also be used in food and representatives of their species.
Despite this, he succumbed to everything that had happened in the water; his foot wasn't even worth such a giant as the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Despite the fact that their food would not have caused us most of the surprise, special dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them are wild, Paulina, Slimaki and one of the spices, known as the final sun.
Another difference was that when the poor and the women ate, sitting on the chairs, the rich walked the banquets, on which they ate and at the same time rested.
In the composition of dishes prepared in Ancient Rome, it was not possible to include products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia later.
They didn't have, in particular, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa. It should still be added that none of the ancient Romans had ever had the opportunity to ask an Indian.
To each of his gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built the main temple, which he considered to be his home.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs, honoring them with various festivals and ceremonies.
In each temple there was an inner courtyard and a shrine, where only the priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of the temples, special towers, similar to the pyramids, were erected. They were known as zicurats.
The tower's porch was a special shrine dedicated to God.

There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was “Scandinavian”.
If you watched the film "The Treasure of the Nation", you might think that on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is actually written on the reverse side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, was written: “The original version of the Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776”. The record in reverse form is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows exactly, but it is known that the large parchment paper (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) at the beginning of its existence was wrapped up for preservation.
Therefore, it can be completely possible that this record was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the landings in Normandy and subsequent battles, France managed to liberate the north, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was under the control of the Whistleblowers, the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon began – the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of “Free France” liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they set out to the side of Germany.
"Civilization is the only culture of a fairly large group of people who work together and live in a society.
The above-mentioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "gramadian". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, then "gramadian", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "state" of the country.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transfer of knowledge through generations, the uniform distribution and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Rarely, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence thirteen states first established a weak central government in accordance with the House of Representatives on the establishment of a confederation of thirteen states. Only Congress was a part of this government.
At the imposition of taxes, the Congress had no powers, and, since the national executive and judicial authority did not exist, he counted on ensuring the implementation of all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not set in motion.
In addition, it did not have the power to abolish the tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the House of Representatives on the establishment of a confederacy for the adoption of amendments, unanimous consent was needed from all states, and the states were so far from accepting the Central Government's attack that their representatives were often absent there.

Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the Hanseatic Islands. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelagic" from the point of view of geography, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when its name was written by European brands, which passed by way of “Pharmoz” – it meant “beautiful islands”.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of breadmaking. For the processing of rice and sugar plantations, the company hired a few Chinese workers.
The Tsing Dynasty (1644-1912) in 1683 captured the western and northern Taiwanese territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Tsing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Chinese government in 1895 concluded a Symanac Treaty, in accordance with which Japan was transferred the right of sovereignty over the island, and the last ruler of the island in 1945.
The composition of the Machu Picchu includes three main objects: the Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with three windows.
In order for tourists to get a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edge of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
Up to 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular format of photos for real shots in the world is the 35 mm format. On the scale of the era of analog images, this format of film predominates.
Such a film is still produced now, but more importantly, the ratios of its width and height are now used in the formats of the matrix of digital cameras.
This can be a bit of a slap from the pants, but in fact the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the ratios of sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) are 3:2.
The same or similar aspect ratios have many common formats (e.g., family of APS formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often subjected to attack and ridicule, presents itself with simple parades, which provide dynamism and at the same time maintain a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, then the best place to place the main object is at the intersection of lines, which share a photo in the vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activity of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close attention.
With all the linguistic and cultural differences that took place, the Christian religion has united the European countries for more than a thousand years.
All of them, from the king to the prastaludin, were under her omnipresence.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth must be used to reduce the burden and to alleviate the suffering, and that it is for this that the means of the Church exist.
For more than a thousand years, the central ecclesiastical authorities have been in Rome. Due to this concentration of power and money, many people wonder whether this dogma is being fulfilled.
The United Kingdom launched a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of the war.
The embargo on the supply of vital goods of military and civil purpose, although it violated the generally recognized international law, which over the last two centuries has been strengthened at the legislative level by several international agreements, ad hoc.
The United Kingdom has replaced international waters so that ships could not enter certain areas of the ocean. As a result, it has endangered even neutral ships.

Only four cents, a collection of works and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bachalar (his former workplace manager), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China there were unique ways to designate different eras. At each stage of the history of China or in each family under the rule there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, periods of dynasty rule were divided into periods of unified provinces, when there was instability. The most famous of them was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many of the courts, which fought for the throne, carried out indiscriminate hostilities among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest place in the Great Palace of Zion.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them is the transition from absolutism to the republican system of government, the introduction of a metric system, the emergence of nationalism and the belief that the country does not belong to the right.
In addition, the various post-Revolution positions became accessible to all male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious ones to come up with.
The same thing happened in the army, because if in the past the military titles were assigned, starting with the slogan, then now - on the basis of skills and skills.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries inspired the French Revolution to start their own revolutions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Magameta was deeply interested in the questions that went beyond the limits of peaceful life. In order to meditate and meditate, he often visited the cave on the mountains of Nur (presented as "light"), which is known as "Hira".
The very cave, which has endured the test at times, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual standings of the Magma.
Five o'clock is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find it, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the furnace you are in complete isolation.
In addition to the clean beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains you will not see anything. From the cave very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The pyramid of Heops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to our day.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were built to commemorate the pharaoh-infidel. It was built in the third century B.C.E.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of Death in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the wife and members of the Pharaoh's family.
The sign, which means the movement of the slide up, looks like a "V", and down - like a bar or square without the bottom side.
"The tip of the bow" means that you need to start the movement from the end of the bow and lead them up, and "the tip of the bow down" - that you need to start with the bow (this is the place where your hand holds the bow) and lead the bow down.
The movement of the tuning up usually gives a softer sound, and down - stronger and more confident.
You can put your marks on the pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols of the bow stand there not only so, but with a certain musical occasion, so usually you need to keep them.
On October 6, 1789, because of the crowd of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, was frightened of their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Mary Theresa), as well as Madame Louise, sister of the King, the Muse
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. On the way around them, a crowd of people in it rushed, broke and shouted threats to the King and Queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the curtains under the influence of the crowd.
At one point, a man from the crowd rushed to the queen, who was still scared to death, the head of a guard in Versailles.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists, which were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Philippines itself.
To pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were placed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the U.S. imperialists would be the surpluses that would have brought about the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
In order to imagine who the Templars were, it is necessary to understand well what became the preconditions for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, when these events took place, the Classical Middle Ages is a period in the history of Europe that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First there was the Early Middle Ages, after him the Classical Middle Ages, and after him the Late Middle Ages. The latter, it is believed, ended in about 1500 AD.
By the term "technological determinism" understand a whole series of practical ideas, from the pressure with the aim of promoting certain technologies or technical necessity to an accurate understanding of what the human destiny is conditioned on the logic, the logic, and the human destiny.
Two common ideas are characteristic of most of the interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself, to a large extent, goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, does not only do the same.
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of the road.
However, if the number of machines will be small, the common international network of highways does not make economic sense. For this reason, the development of new ways of production, which will allow to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of health protection, which allow to treat various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of romanticism.
When we talk about the era of Romanticism, people were strongly influenced by the geography of the presence. Over time, the traditions and culture associated with it have emerged. They were better than openly introduced laws, because they existed in harmony with the game and the game with it.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in the feudal era.
Around 400 A.D., the city gained fame as an epicenter of luxury and maintained this status until almost 1100 A.D.
By the turn of the 12th century, its status as a luxury capital was fading. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were sharp spices and shows, and they were valued much higher than was offered in the markets of Vienna.
It was at that time that Constantinople assumed the title of fashion capital of Paris.
The development of the Gothic style came in the period between 10 and 11 as well as in the 14th century.
At first, a strong influence on the style of conquest was shown by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles can be delayed by 25-30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people, as a result of cross-roads, began to use the sounds to play the dress, was one of the biggest events of the time.
In the natural farm house, a number of food products are produced, which provides the exclusive needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is a simple and, as a rule, an organic system. It is based on the use of a specific ecological region of preserved seeds in combination with sevasvarot or other non-complicated crops in this country.
A lot of farmers have historically grown a natural farm. Now many third-world countries are still practicing this.
Subcultures bring people closer together with similar views, which, from the position of social norms, feel separated attention, and allow them to develop in themselves a sense of self-worth.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and (or) gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a separate subculture can be based on a variety of factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often determine their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manners of behavior and jargon.
As an illustration of what constitutes socialization and how important it is, most often bring an example with children who have not been lucky enough to grow up in the atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various ailments or demeanours and abras and which adults have not socialized.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children have been in captivity for a long time (usually this is how their own parents happened to them); in some cases, the absence of parental care was not the result of parental disapproval and parental disapproval.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, the ferocious children could experience serious injuries or experience trauma. . . .
Others, it seems, were raised by animals; by hearing, some lived independently in the wild nature.
When a child has fully raised animals, his behaviors are reflected in almost everything (taking into account the physical limitations) of the behavior of the animal-educator: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be obnoxious to them.
While the goal of project learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Skafolding is not a method of learning, but rather a helper that helps people gain new learning experience. It can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants are both a teacher, and a small clip in the program "Micrasoft Office".
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed in order to ask questions, make instructions and explain the procedures with which the student or the listener is difficult to deal with on their own.
There are many reasons why children may find themselves in foster families. This can be both a harsh habit, and a lack of vision, and even a compulsion.
It is not possible to allow children to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, does not educate them and does not engage in their education, but it is still happening.
In our view, the system of foster families is a safe zone for such children.
It is believed that, thanks to our system of foster families, they will be dependent on reliable medical care, safe houses, good and attentive educators, and stable education. . . .
It is believed that a foster family must provide all the needs of a child who was not satisfied in the house from which he was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
Due to the special characteristics of the Internet, there are additional possibilities for its use and the satisfaction of the needs of the audience.
For example, the idea that concepts such as “education” and “socialization” are difficult motives for using the Internet is expressed (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal participation" and "permanent relationships" were also defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in the study of the audience's reaction to websites.
Thanks to the video, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions - they mean the movement of the muscles of the face, which lasts only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that the correct interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "President's Exit" Oliver Sax noted that people with a damaged brain, without understanding the speech itself, can, however, accurately appreciate the sincerity.
He even speculates that animals —for example, domestic dogs— may also be able to correctly interpret a person’s behavior.
The results of research of the twentieth century testify to the existence of two foundations of genetic variability, namely, the obvious and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutations, new genetic variations occur, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of detected ones.
With each subsequent generation, the segregation and recombination move variations in these two pools.
In savannah, existing plant resources can't satisfy the need for primates in amino acids, if their digestive system is similar to that of a human.
More than that, if they fail to do so, the consequences are serious. This is both malnutrition, and depression of growth, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins, which can be found in beans and leaves. However, if they are not properly prepared, then organisms of such primates as we have them are difficult to assimilate.
On the contrary, the food of animal origin (murders, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large number of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily absorbed.
Thinking about it, it is not surprising to find out that our ancestors solved their own “white problem” in almost the same way as the chimpanzee in the sauna today.
During the break of sleep is meant the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and resuscitation after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you are converting the clock into a dream, try to put it at the other end of the room. So, you will need to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants, based on biarrhea, before sleep it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (first of all water or tea, a known macaroni remedy) - this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
The inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The apparent life force is all the more positive than below the tension. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can reach everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The basis of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teaching of the Buddha, which was supplemented by the love of the Mahayana and a number of methods of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini-yoga and love for the whole of humanity.
The followers of Kundalini Yoga claim that in order to awaken the energy of Kundalini (the energy of enlightenment), it is necessary to practice certain postures of yoga, mantras and visualization, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a major part of the practice of Tibetan meditation. Visualization of various gods allows you to cleanse the energy channels, open chakras and gain an enlightened consciousness.
During the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial and cultural conflicts led to a dispute between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins – the former allies are transformed into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and it was really fought by the armies of friendly countries. The battlefields were located in different regions – from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence was broken up until 17 September 1939. The retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night, these plans lost meaning, because more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army in the composition of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Russian-Soviet and Russian-Soviet peace accords.
Freight transport by ship is obviously the most effective way of transportation through the ocean of a large number of people and cargoes.
The traditional task of the naval forces was to ensure that their country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time the worker could not transport his people and goods.
The North Atlantic Company during the Second World War became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the help of the United Kingdom, the Americans tried to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, using submarines for this, mainly.
Germany would probably be able to conquer the United Kingdom in the same way it would have conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had suffered a failure.
It looks like the goats were first introduced to the Iranian mountains of Zagros about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to divorce them in order to always have milk, hair, meat and skin at hand.
Usually domestic goats thrived in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Often they were cared for by Cossacks — children or teenagers. The latter performed the role of shepherds. So the animal will breed in our time.
As early as the 16th century, roads were built in England.
Although the cobblestone roads and were merely parallel wooden boards, they allowed the train horses to move at a higher speed and to pull loads at a greater weight than on the existing uneven roads.
Stoves began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that the movement of the rails will be more effective if they will be covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons were more quickly worn out.
After some time on the change of wooden wheel came iron. The first fully made of metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known means of movement was the hajj. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homa erectus (meaning "man walking"), people began to walk in a vertical posture.
The australians, their predecessors, usually did not walk straight.
The australopithecines are found in fossils, the age of which is between 4.2 and 3.9 million years, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago the sachelantrope had already walked on two legs.
You can be more aware of the environment, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future the aforementioned sufferings do not turn out to be very strong.
Often it looks faster than symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a temporary solution, then we need to find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to the technical and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the 4th of July declaration was adopted by the Congress, its handwritten copy, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hank, and the Secretary of State, Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printery of John Dunlap, which was located at a somewhat remote location.
During the night trains were made from 150 to 200 copies, now known as the “Danlap Arches”.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document in the Independence Hall court for the first time.
On 6 July, George Washington received one of the individuals, which he read to his troops in New York on 9 July. On 10 August, another individual arrived in London.
To date, there have been 25 first printed individuals of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original manuscript individual has not been preserved.
Many of the modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that it even exists to this day, only we call them birds.
Because of the feathers and the ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
However, to this day, birds have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have hips and groin on the legs, lay eggs, and, like the tyrannical Rex, walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations with encoded in the form of double-counting information.
A binary number can include only one of two values - 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (on a computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have a clear sign. For example, ribs are a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to establish an immediate diagnosis.
For the first time, the internal poisoning can be evidenced by an open container with tablets or taxi-based household chemicals.
Instructions on the provision of timely medical assistance for this particular atrut need to be looked at on the label.
For the definition of this group of insect entomologists, the term "pluck" is used in the formal sense.
This term was coined because people had long known what constitutes bed bugs — these insects, which, to a higher degree, are adapted to parasitic on humans.
Both the kissing flaps and the bedside flaps are nesting parasites, they have become accustomed to living in nests or in the house of their master.
About 400,000 cases of disseminated sclerosis (RS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is prevalent among adults of young and middle age.
Rash sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the head and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
According to the results of the study, it was found that women suffer twice as often as men from RS.
A couple may conclude that raising a baby does not correspond to their interest or the interest of the child that they already have.
Such couples can give up their child for adoption.
When adopting a child's parents, the child's parents refuse their parental rights in order to grow up and raise him, other spouses may.
The main purpose of science is to find out through the scientific method how the world works. In fact, most scientific research is carried out with the help of this method.
There is, however, not only him. An experiment (this is a test that is carried out to exclude one or more possible pitfalls with the help of questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Most of all, the attention of philosophers and naturalists was given to the classical text. First of all, it is also about the Bible in Latin.
At the time, Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including in the field of psychology, were considered to be generally accepted.
When the number of people who possessed the Greek language decreased, the West became endowed with its scientific and philosophical roots. . . .
Many biorhythms, which can be observed in the behaviors and physiology of animals, to a large extent depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been recorded, which are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even if the signals from the outside do not occur, the above-mentioned process continues in the form of independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is a genetic material, was tested in the course of the Hershey and Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA in the bacteria Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, during which the DNA of the bacteriophage was marked by radioactive phosphorus or by the radioactive serum - the bacteriophage protein.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of the genetic material in which the mutation took place, and whether the cells in it are bound by the cells of the embryonic line, the mutations can have a wide variety of consequences.
Only mutations in embryonic cells can be hereditary. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ekaturism convinces those people who are interested in visiting different natural zones and territories, because they want to enjoy the common species and landscape, including, to enjoy the sight of flora and fauna.
As an example of what you can do in nature, you can bring fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystems.
As an example, you can visit, study and photograph Arangotans on the island of Barnea.
People leave every morning on their cars from small provincial cities to go to work. Along the way, they are passed by other people who work there, from where they just left.
In this dynamic transport environment, everyone has one or the other to do with the private car-based transport system and is supported by it.
Scientific evidence suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has violated the stability of the biosphere, which has contributed significantly to human evolution over the last two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who take part in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you will hardly hear so many complaints about the fall of fertilizers or water quality.
Why transport systems are a constant source of such complaints, why do they cease to operate regularly? Is there a reason for insufficient competent engineers on transport? Is there anything more significant going on?
The term "transport movement" means the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and means of transport between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows presents a complex problem, because it is not possible to predict the behavior of the drivers with one-percent confidence.
The conductors, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, the transport flows are characterized by a certain rationally conditioned sequence and can be roughly described with the help of mathematical models.
In order to show more fully and qualitatively what constitutes the movement of the means of transport, it has been established that its three main parameters are related to each other: (1) flow, (2) straightness and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as to engage in their operation.
The first of the animals in the air rose insects. The ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more effectively, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are formed along the body.
Because of this, they can be killed in various very small places to hide there from the predators.
Stracoses and fly-overs are the only insects in our time that cannot make wings.
A man named Aristorus claimed a few thousand years ago that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many people had a different idea — that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
It's hard to believe that when you're on Earth, it's hard to tell if it's moving, isn't it?
Cancer of the Amazon occupies the second place on Earth along the length of all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times more than in the river, which occupies the second place.
The widest cancer on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the ocean from the planet's river.
Amazonian cancer, in which water from thousands of smaller rivers is infused, has a length of 6387 km (3,980 miles).
Although the construction of the pyramid with the use of stone continued until the end of the Age of the Old Kingdom, in terms of the size and technical perfection of the building, no one has ever been able to overcome the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period came to the delight of their ancestors of the monuments, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
There are only about 800 people living in the Vatican. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In the legislation and official communications of the Vatican, the Italian language is used.
The majority of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious rites. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (for example, gold, silver and copper) are found in nature in a natural form and they are relatively easy to obtain with the help of primitive devices of work, people knew about them even in antiquity.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that the composition of any thing includes one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas-like, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can and can be transformed into other things in order to become what we observe.
In most cases, the alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, the composition of which includes a small number of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that at the point at the end of this sentence, there will be trillions of them.
As a result, when the drug appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use have decreased as new methods of writing appear.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and the pointer is not needed by anyone.
We can only guess what fate will attack the keyboard if something fundamentally new comes in exchange for it.
The principle of action of a plutonium bomb consists in the use of nuclear fusion energy when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like jumping to the top of a very hard landing. Re-distribution of the core will release a part of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to break down with a slight external impact or at all without it.
The surface of the Moon is made up of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side - about 100 km.
Under the monthly margins, the moon's crust is thinner, and under the highlands it is thicker.
The lunar seas may be closer to us on the side of the moon, because here the thinner crust, and, accordingly, the lava was easier to rise to the surface.
The theory is based on what is driving people or what is enabling them to do.
These theories are based on the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they turn into internals and which provide a subjective character (i.e., internalized) during maturation.
The above-mentioned theories describe what it is that makes individual people want what they are doing, and what factors in their environment can affect whether or not they are going to do certain things.
Herzberg's "Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs" and "The Two-Factor Theory" are two authoritative substantive theories.
In essence, when leaders appoint their former colleagues, two types of behavior can arise. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain "his boy" (or "his girl").
The manager, who applies to this type, may observe difficulties with the assessment of the effectiveness of the work, the adoption of unpopular decisions, the application of disciplinary measures, the sharing of responsibility and the attraction to the responsibility of the culprits.
Another extreme is the situation when a person changes to unrecognizability - he feels the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and to attribute it to himself.
In the end, the responsibility for the success and failure of the team is borne by the leader.
This type of behavior often ends with quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standards of excellence for regular teams must also be adhered to by virtual teams, but there are small differences.
Typically, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the relevant real group.
Considering that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understandable for the local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of leaders that each member is subordinated to is the so-called “invisible team”. It sets standards for each member.
For what reason can the organization want to go through the continuous process of creating a learning organization? Innovation is one of the purposes of applying to the practice of organizational concepts of learning.

Thus, the process that is used by an organization, whose employees are trying to overcome some obstacle in common, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies the customer's needs.
The leadership of the organization should create a culture for which the character of innovation, the exchange of knowledge and organizational learning. Only after this organization can be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continuum approach is a method by which an organization can achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
The theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is reinforced by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. As a result, the field of research is narrowed and becomes more accurate.
The results of the research, which has been received by scientists, are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between the brain's pathologies and human behavior.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain and brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, formations, blisters, pathological changes and brain tumors affect behavior and change some of the mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes that are still unknown to us in it.
Thanks to this, we get a huge amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which, in turn, help us to understand the processes that are taking place in our minds.
Although usually the term "artificial intelligence" and evokes association with science fiction, in fact AI is a very important branch of computer science, which is engaged in the study of behaviors, the process of learning and intellectual adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks, for the performance of which it is necessary for machines to behave in a reasonable manner.
As an example, you can bring planning and control, the ability to respond to requests and technical problems in customers, as well as recognize faces, voices and cracks.
They have distinguished themselves into specific disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions for them.
In our time, AI is often used in economics, medicine, technical and military spheres. In addition, it is a component of software for some computer programs and videogames.
Excursions make up a large part of schooling. Rarely a teacher leads students to such places that it is impossible to get to by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, you can organize virtual tours. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beauty of works of art. And all this - without leaving the class.
Joint participation in virtual tours is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share the experience in the lessons in the future.
Students at the Bennett School in North Korea, for example, about their trip to the state capital each year form a website, and every year it is reworked, but the network in the form of an album remains old versions.
In addition, blogging can improve the student’s written language. Although at the beginning of the blog grammar and archagraphy in them often “culgaes”, this usually changes to the better side, thanks to the availability of the tools.
Considering that students are usually the most captivating audience, the author of the blog to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve his or her style.
Despite this, blogging “helps students to better understand the world around them.” The need to maintain the interest of the audience inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Tota, 2004).
The conduct of blogs promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach suggests. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Atava is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find many art galleries and museums, which give the opportunity to get acquainted with the past country and its modernity.
The Niagara Falls lies further to the south, and to the north is the Muscoke Lake, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
That's why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Antaria to be a typical Canadian province.
In significant parts of its territory, which is further to the north, there are very few people living, and some, at all, imagine almost an inhospitable desert.
To compare the population, you can bring up the following fact, which is surprising to many: the number of African-Americans in the United States exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
