Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the ex-prison of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of a deal with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet firm, the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which condemned the former prime minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be seen who is the winner.
As is already the custom in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of elucidating whether it is moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off from their hands.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit, instead, the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted the help of unfaithful dogs with gratitude.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "cruises"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make themselves with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of Shariah don't cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go to the hunt for investor seeker
A statistical storm has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical offices in the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards gradual slowdown in economic development growth is formed.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated four-quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest rate on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany, there are voices that say the ECB should grant loans ultimately.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a bonus of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so there will be no shortage of the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrate their pass to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defence, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the national football arches will receive a bonus of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes it was a good offensive game.
Both teams struggled just to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center in Iran’s Isfahan city on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is struggling to get nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of Isfahan’s nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which would be aimed at paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program, not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner wrapped
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as evidenced by current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for the healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children feed, for example, on stools at least twice as often as children in normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 Basic Education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and plenty of family exercise are determining factors, which make the number of overweight and even obese children significantly decrease.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results says.
No breakfast but with built-in for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, the details, which also count, are important, such as having a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school-age families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
But the worst part was finding that 10% of households don’t have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, insane potato chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“The popularity of sweet soft drinks is alarming in particular,” the study’s final report warns.
As a main meal, the pasta is taken from the palm and followed closely by the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence,” a significant change was made in many cases in favor of the principles of a healthy diet,” the study notes.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish in the questionnaire for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it no longer fits a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) how to dress a woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is cut short, someone has a stylized figure without proper curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must be able to visually soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to make the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not wearing it in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least one piece of extra tailored fabric sewn.
No doubt they will not regret it, because the clothes they feel perfectly are priceless.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop to move, stand up, dance on your waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I’m glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two costumes: one for the day and the other for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have recently weighed about a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them off from magazines or look them up on the internet and print them, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, is not only physically dressed, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k talked about all this.
But all of this is left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists encouraged Saturday’s conference with information about all types of bodies.
Designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just hang it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What is most valuable is the following advice: “In order to start working, you need to know all the rules first.”
“Then you can break them,” Jacob said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you need to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters find it useless too (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it should be borne in mind that they are very likely to indicate a size very different from their actual size (minor).
Then it only remains to peer and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has thickened/thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for the stylist to be fashion oriented, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you see, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t care, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify your wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t pick up and throw away everything there was and say, ‘Here’s what horror.”
“Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job bag.
This is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
There is also a nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or caps), special gripping clips of clothes in front, if it were larger (the pins and other types of grips are not allowed, because you could play a game)
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservations.
The truth is that I am not given those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that devoting myself to style at a professional level is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly the same thing as people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, we compete across America.
Reviewer
A trip, in principle unconcerned, gets complicated because of a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but this was of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new release, to which The Run is added to the title, sparked great expectations even before its release.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result, it appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results don’t vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given as acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, mistakes cannot be called, but rather the incomprehensible devastation of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
He introduces you to a story whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit on the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
From this it is deduced that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous series deliveries.
Therefore, it is nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a while, you try to advance a required amount of rivals (normally in a classic race), then try to earn time (classical timed duel) and then expect a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this, sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than one would expect (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of previous episodes.
That means it’s not a big deal anymore, but it can’t be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action suits quite well this style of driving, although we can find something better between the games of the competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a while.
Unlike the correct driving patterns, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games of this type you can’t expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can’t predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that when you make a very tight forward or circle the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making unchecked pirouettes.
It even ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no major problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s just a help in case something goes wrong, but it’s not very reliable.
Sometimes, even the reset doesn’t help, it just helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find "civil" vehicles at some point always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent forwards without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the match you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front, so at first you can make the car a mess.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race so that it doesn’t break the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas suppliers next to the road, because right there you have to change the car, although in the vast majority of cases it will be enough for you to have what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, by curved mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenge thread, i.e. there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for the challenges and the stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes available other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
By car you arrive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you get to run in the dark through the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you the convoy of the metro arrives and takes you forward without further ado.
In the editorial board we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the real authors take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoids absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eye with the force of airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks to be mounted.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> began her lecture in the Faculty of Law.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U.S. College of Law.
Vicen<0xC3><0xA1> also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes to mind is the criticism, that if it's insulting, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
“He’s a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them, and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new foreign and security policy representative position is explained by the question "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?", which is an important step towards unifying and clarifying the political union towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> has also addressed the follow-up, follow-up and follow-up of the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good commotion", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the EU budget for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is, I don’t like the ugly abbreviations, the extraterrestrials, or the jargon that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is due to a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?’ and it turns out that he doesn’t do him any favors.”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, is waiting for new very tough budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the two-speed concept, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, that stay out.”
“These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen Europe at both speeds,” Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would very accurately define IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that perceives itself as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The basis of this long-range character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the Bata entrepreneur in the Czech Republic (the IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in its relationship with the customer.
From the very beginning the company knew how to discover talent (being one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, whereby Palmisano will replace him next year with a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that ideas arise, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution concept rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Green Great” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include ATMs, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes, and floppy disks.
IBM is expected to make $220 billion this year, making it the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet for its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the Future
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and another-fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier’s share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern world financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM is acting on the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown strategically up to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
We can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 – originally a brand used in the Canadian and South American branches.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "check-in clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his Supervisory Board.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company’s large expansion began across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the boss’s chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of the time, came to the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive, high value-added advice and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances improved, for example in relation to transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her husband infiel:
Iveta, stay with that fool, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
And Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who lies with his wife.
If one day Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, his wife would not wait for him at home with his arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
“But here I would live no longer as my dear old fool who was wrong, but as a man to whom I have certain ties,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that he had already disengaged from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn’t care if his wife closes the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
“The company is still in effect, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases.”
“Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is we don’t share a bed,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I already know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can make men bleed?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who is addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one per week?
Do you like to buy often at discounts?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should pacify their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more through the clothing stores, look for well-fitted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner you’d better wait in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I would need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What's that?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite uncle.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Does he blame his partner for having stepped on the clean floor with a dirty foot, his children who have dirtyed a newly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In the event that you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should surely not occupy themselves with being paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make Unpleasant Comments
"Used socks are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you do those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will be able to get him out of his drawers.
Of course, you don't mean anything bad, you just want everything to be okay.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and Chismes
Some women are also given the slander, gossip, but also the insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
At best, each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless schism.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love gossiping and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women’s work team.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought the win over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina field and put the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jagr's partner, Jakub Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game, I told him I'd make a triplet."
“I presented it.”
“Sometimes they look ambushed,” explained Jagr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers’ first run.
A short time later the team’s second intervention also had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek made himself with the disc behind the Hurricanes' doorstep and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored the third goal, after his shot was tied for Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the pitch, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very pleased with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” added J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's penalty again, to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit him on the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury on top of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
“In the end, but it’s that nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even further, take the record out of our field."
“And so we leave gaps,” explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were mostly selling trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists went on holiday to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovak ones) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at the time, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night like that, or have “well-knowns” at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", which thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there was a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czech way of travel has been a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, the fact that to the present favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, you could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s visa exemptions were imposed to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was taking food (contains, sausages, etc.) with them to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the Czech crown convertibility, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in travel demand.
As the demand for travel increased, from 1997 on a regular basis, the agencies began to prepare travel using charter flights, which led to an incredible decrease in travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart to distant and warm countries. This winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit them about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including on-site expenses.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to be held this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement on the voting rules to be followed has not yet been reached.
Without them, you can’t even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post in June without first convening his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to handle football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighbourhood of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.
There was no consensus as to who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that point on, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Executive Committee could no longer shed more light on the situation than, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, it basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead end?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Region of Moravia is ready to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," this is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
That said, surprisingly, is also agreed with Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more appropriate for Pelta.
“I would like you to vote as much as possible according to the statutes.”
“So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first running as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still an optimist.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be pacified with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
“Football will again be the protagonist, and so it will cooperate more happily,” says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that a deal will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between bohemians and Moors, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
"This may result in a new blockade by the General Assembly."
“Anyway, I hope that common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who knows until the game begins if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport apart from the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k will fight for the presidency because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen’s head of football, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not presenting myself as an election candidate."
"But to this day no such person has been found," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, in case of victory, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly came.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people that I could take into account.”
“For me it was crazy to hear some say they don’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.”
“I would like to change that vision,” he adds.
What allegedly bothers Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k the most at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the status would remain in effect and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
“And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes some caution from his previous statement that he would “sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president.”
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k could discuss cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation."
"but not as a manager of an association."
“I also don’t put my nose where I don’t feel capable,” added Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first-division triumph in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee decisions, producing unpleasant situations," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said without hiding his dislikes for Spartan President Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing.”
“If they raised taxes on gambling, as announced by political parties, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he said.
In addition, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club shares to another person and then going back there after a year and a half,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
Jablonec’s representative is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the potential victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People of all levels have been taking care of football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President this Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta warned.
Precisely the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to gain delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
In the past, he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his legal training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k who, unlike Pelta, did not let the puppet with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the football world, and it's already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
“I would also try to resolve all the scandals that emerged because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector to ensure there is enough money for all of football,” the 46-year-old said two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios vacating before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
“Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader,” Pelta continues to be optimistic two days before the most decisive day in his representative career.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working with desire.
If current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl were elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the Fourth General Assembly, many people would surely show resentment.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to solving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by former President Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, to professional football or the training of young high-performing footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area."
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.”
“A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me that will stop me and hinder me every step of the way,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I should not give up because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith not to give up like that, without more,” he said.
According to them, he is also motivated to continue the work that has already begun with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose now was done.”
"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before the time of Hasek.
“I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few elected."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Moravia, whose winners would go to the first division.”
"It would not be the current situation in which we have only three teams from Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the fight in the presidential elections, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes,” Rajchl said, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year.”
“In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and he would not significantly change the staffing staff in the committees.”
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she could not miss in her luggage, a swimmer.
Tomb of backs on the water, looking at the artistic dome at the top, swimming towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool and amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathroom culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that fans in the bathroom have to conform to blue tiles and chlorination, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or hear the cheerful bird trins in the park.
“One day I wondered why the pools have to be so ugly all the time,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting pretty pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Swimming in the pool and the essential oils of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, the bathrooms have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it wants to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the Széchenyi bath in Budapest, 100 years old, are the waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of a terbez<0xC3><0xBA>r.
Many of the swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on the rooftop pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the skis from which you can practice it.
The design, perhaps most extraordinary, awaits customers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: The <0xC3><0x96>tztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steam rises in winter, while the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas-oil plague is so strong that people think it has reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose lémo stick to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed at a place in her search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found herself with a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decadence countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neo-Romanesque elements of the times of their construction be discovered in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the style of Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its bold modernisation in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
“It is a great honor to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the raw material business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, to 84 percent of Germans it does not seem acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges raises prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate’s campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price swings.
The main experts agree that players have disengaged from offers and demands, and draw profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the requirements of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Bets at rising food prices show especially dramatically how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann is considered to be the largest banker, especially in terms of obligations.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether Ackermann deals with the subject of people who go hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to barely care about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would bet.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they found that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would advise such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The House 21 in Vienna
The transferred pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
The modern postwar architecture is passionate, the clear forms, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exposition is a suitable example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Architecture Grand Prix for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th-century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked space and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good environment.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, was opened a lucky blow in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founder director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and patrons of the public.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the same name foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also an office building is built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with glass fiber was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a downlight panel between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and would also like the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
That of the pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and therefore wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city about a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train crashes in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train crashes and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, on the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For this, a better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and andes.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice trays for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of mishaps and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations under adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakdown of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millionaire Fines in the U.S.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector’s giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator has accused many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other major banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have set up countless processes to receive compensation or fines.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the most demands.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a FHFA lawsuit, dealing in business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to contribute $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
It should be understood long before IBM primarily provides services and provides computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed at CNBC that he has acquired shares of IBM for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing about the commitment so far.
He praised the management who took care of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of lucrative Information Technologies such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock market rose 1 percent.
“The blue giant,” as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is real.
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper talks about a “bloody ideology” that reawakens.
The murders of eight small trick and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin it has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin there is a ghost that was believed to have died long ago, since the fires in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with far-right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving?", headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" notes on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right panhandle.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap in the face: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci’s column title.
He points out that the killers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of German people of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not searched long before suspects in the circle of the far-right.
Some are less rhetorical as to the drastic media: “From now on it is lost here, immigrants are left with nothing but self-defense and armament.”
"This will be the best self-protection."
“Germany’s internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in danger, the attacks on M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen will be made clear in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press it was then mainly criticized the lack of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen fire attack he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the taxes of the Turks of Germany contribute.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deeply it has since been the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort for a broad explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for frank words.
The Bank of the Lake Zurich Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves friendly remarks about its future partners.
"USB has achieved a revitalization."
"Me alegra collaborar con Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, general manager of the USB, a well-known banker in Switzerland, had to go.
The president of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been known to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is certainly necessary.
He takes responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just proved again that it deserves the title “the biggest bank in the scandal in Europe” for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also manoeuvrable, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s major banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: “In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank.”
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general manager, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some looked contemptuously until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest-paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its misinvestments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a bond that was necessarily convertible, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated into a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defied taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
In doing so, the UBS admitted to having more or less helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customers' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through misconceived speculation and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it came to being something quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was going to get it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happened, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was going wrong.
And it turned out, of course, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in the investment bank.
“With the Adoboli case, it turns out that the risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
So the idea of precaution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been present, emerged to be the guardians of the world’s greatest goods: no risk too great, on the contrary, the security of money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks’ security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered at Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, to the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large signpost to indicate "safety".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both major banks.
The UBS has become too large, he says, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the great Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in its nation's history," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig writes in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they feel?
He talks to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make a step from bank learning to the summit.”
Finally, Ospel turned to Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: the defector arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the banks' success.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange operations and in stock trading it was at its highest.
However, the advisors of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his existence.
Avid growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold U.S. mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the downfall for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions at the UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But the investment bank needs to slow down a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
However, he insisted: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking right now.
So far, he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without effect.
The halted industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing at its origin a crisis caused by debt.
General relief could not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back on the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values closed with a drop of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
At the session, the market barometer ranges from 12,027 to 12,170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax index is down 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is placed at the end of its boom.
Companies produced 2 percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistics office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, just confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks from your point of view.
Instead, he throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Its more than $10 billion investment in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s share price and makes it price against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.

Smart grids spread in cities
In many places the grasses are considered "problematic birds": they do not expel these very intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grasses belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the crap and noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means has appeared against the “problematic birds” so far.
Grasses no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first grass symposium in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grades; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The tiles are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 he jumped the negative headlines of the press a controversial project to mass-murder the district.
Critics have called hunting animals by means of bird traps and killing them with sticks as especially brutal.
“Ejecting them and removing them normally achieves nothing,” said Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver, urban planner and landscaper at Leer.
Shooting with water at the nests or throwing trees are usually unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"Animals diverge, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Killing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of removing animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible for them to settle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens, psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a spike in the face with an aplomb."
In Schleswig-Holstein, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascheberger Graduation Course, where signposts inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms for the noise of birds: "Everything is forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the graces not only take advantage of the resources to access sketchy pieces, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge have checked in four degrees to what extent the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape the stone needed to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the astute graders had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get to their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four grades achieved it in the first attempt.
Portugal at the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the away game, made the five Euro appearances in a row.
The Czechs scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the away game (2-0).
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) lead against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) cut distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a free direct from more than 30 meters to get his head in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed off his dots to score from afar and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, Englishman Manchester City sent a header to the pole, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek hit the Czech Republic
Then, Ergolding’s fellow Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark filed a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with last doubt in the 81st minute with goal by Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the Euro.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own door (9).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the turn of the front, very just at Cech's gate.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper's larguero, the frontman of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey has taken advantage of the wonder of Zagreb’s football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was due to leave his World Cup third-party bench seat in 2002, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made place to Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won 4-0 in the away game prepared for a previous decision, put himself in the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the very first moment, the Estonian defence avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he pushed it forward.
After a defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, reaching 1-0.

A hungry labrador dog lights a kiln, setting a house on fire
A starving dog allegedly set fire to a home in Brandenburg/Havel.
The dog probably jumped over the stove to reach for food, police said on Friday.
He moved the regulator and lit a kiln.
Papers were taken on the stove.
The fourth-floor home of the neighboring house began burning on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died from inhaling combustion gases.
The fire-causing negligence proceedings against the 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the home during the fire, have continued.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software manufacturer, invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015 they will circulate approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros), the Dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and hire workers,” said Bill McDermott, co-president, at a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Canton, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are based in the country of the boom.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume for 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year it came in at approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the software provider’s businesses employing 50,000 workers around the world go as well as rarely in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We currently want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate sustainable growth in China through extensive instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can cause one to drop his soul at his feet.
Here are some action tips: gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he describes, rightly, as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from collegiate and botanical to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad, or die.
Their lives here blink like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others turn off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the disastrous trench war on the Western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall on their bells; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina drowning in cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
“A lack of facts,” notes Mr Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained from most of the previously published memoirs, letters, and other material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privations and fixing them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German high school girl says, "Successors, everywhere, successors."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed into beef fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and manifests about war: “You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no such thing as a barber’s hat.”
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you give up the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horrendously like “a convicted being strangulated in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century's bestiary: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-crafted clothes running his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embalm their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in a lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to " unleash exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels such as Sin nouveaud on the forehead of Erich Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, pulled that page of dramatis personae out of your fingers, and burned it with a brick.
After a false step in advance, a planned attack per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
He was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the okupas.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called riot training — counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
“To the few cops I know who were called to this, they didn’t tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” the person said, speaking anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but resigned when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district – dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good hour to enter.
“It was appropriate to do so when there was the smallest number of people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with headlights and speakers gathered at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages echoing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they were trying to prevent police from seeing the park go into action, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the park's western edge, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense personal effects swamp, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic trash packed with clothes, the Department of Cleaning teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's cooking area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were hung between them by the arms.
And two people chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut off the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests were for “change of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esp<0xC3><0xB3>sito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen widening the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers’ union will sue the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, the city’s parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city’s access to a health care fund.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing in the City Council last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council counterattacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued, and a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants, and features eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendance as they had been chronically underfunded.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District 36’s budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a job exchange, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parental coordinators were fired,” the complaint drafter says, “and not just in excess.”
Completed mission, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and for U.S. participation to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion.
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's a bipartisan support for his democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties fought with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in some sort of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not as angry as actually drying the grass under his feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO’s mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “states the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win full support from the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves an entire assembly vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have not succeeded so far in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated – the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate – and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment just in the House, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors – especially novice Republicans who seek to refine their curriculums – the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (New York Democrat) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that they have been members when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Golden but undefeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to death in a constituent act in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said she wanted to get it back again.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband animates her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "tough", a change request on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who was given two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords an article in the March 12 murder newspaper when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of her wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've only been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make me feel more sorry than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as a kind of orphan child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant American audience, sometimes adoring.
He gives praise to the troops for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief are conducted in silence and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider his service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled, telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape.
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to the rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room to have a drink.
“It sounded like an alarm,” Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas left his concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after entering Lyman’s room, the man approached him behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread military violation, in violation of soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or prosecute them.
Burke says he's going for the Army's bigger plane, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a structure from top to bottom,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, he will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damage is part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the top four military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of “personality disorder” assigned to rape victims in order to give them the upper hand of service – a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati’s Service of the Human Services Network.
The group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in how it handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her abuser - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared themselves as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember I said to my commanding officer, ""That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed him with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the service under less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his co-applicants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that comes with responsibility.
And he adds, “Probabilities are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs to the queue for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
“Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of his time ahead of his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer’s tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study center DEMOS.
Facebook’s personal information suite is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy – the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence, and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right matches in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a totally new way to do an investigation,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “Likes,” messages on walls, and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “supernova of data” is generating a surge in research, driving the number of academic jobs with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800 percent in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drink feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drinkers.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “clicking” on its own population to get data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - research data from the site should be long overdue.
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London’s Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study that carried out with students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of the user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subjectpaper and a pen are still the best research tools that no one can use.
“There is no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social – and a lot of social still happens offline.”
Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Knights Templar,” he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked under a key.
Everyone attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue suit and tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically alleviate the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I’d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” said a family member of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview, Shown in a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been unearthed as the lead in a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognised designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flowcharts – a man who believed many executives suffered from “a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there is great silence between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see as doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs’ career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years in business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that give you invariably are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting in detail.
Disappointing by the way in which the costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted to a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
The joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making one call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you shouted through the public phone and came back a minute later to the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think there would ever have been Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into turmoil just before the Pope himself was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of baseplates, he asked a customer if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with just 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got bored and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs propheticly predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of his market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is blamed on people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the victory's defeat.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and it grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain — these concepts — adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all boils down to taste – it boils down to trying to expose yourself to the best a human team has done, and then trying to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never had a shame about stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met in a closed-door meeting to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour historic claim is expected for March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be dropped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honor guest, or be on the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethical activists in the government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges that court the same rules apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were housed in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
His appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as an attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as if he were now being impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the maker of Boeing Co. aircraft and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It’s as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs – is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders as fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the fight for governor.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy to governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the violent state elections, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they took the ballots, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by little margin, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates abandoned the local candidacy for fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections may seem, a victory will help propel the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, facing next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two largest fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can’t be immune.”
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and Italy’s and Greece’s prime ministers have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asia support would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India is going to do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the billion-two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point you will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the many and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of mismanaged companies, and loss generators such as railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon Warnings About Possible Defensive Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon’s corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already dictating the $450 billion cuts over the next decade, but now it fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequences, the so-called “sequestration,” would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a boat or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to dismiss many of our civil servants involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to meet the goal."
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good disposition.”
Cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While funding for wartime in offshore contingent operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions to the base budgets,” Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the war-backed contract."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result you can live with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings will increase pressure on a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, despite reaching a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"In effect, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the cuts "generate major operational risks: delays in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter jet, a new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and face potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lie are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “stuck” with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsive countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridiculous with his demented quickly rebutted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university examinations are very widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers to the exams to the students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That’s for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the unknowns lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or “the location of lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie have been rebuffed.
The liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always sneeze, sneeze, or sneeze.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world—especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel good, managing their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-directed lies", while women say more "self-directed" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than to tell their non-married people (to tell them that they are not married).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do I know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide reference points to then measure the changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristics.
It’s best to know if someone normally hits you with their foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see your feet hitting you in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for misleading, verbal, and non-verbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioural groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of their body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or display a “post-interview disapproval”—that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all difficult questions have ended.
Questioners often falsely show that the interview has ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancer language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I am... to understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often an alert signal.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions while pacifying environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada’s CEO, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Nebraska Sandhills and Ogallala aquifer areas, a vast underground water supply.
“This is a true path to progress,” Representative Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to separate any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrorizing her little daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
“Lady Marmalade’s diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, both of whom suffered “personality changes, sleep disorders” and “increased their fear of strangers,” her family says at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year when tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building with her luggage, taking her to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle showed anger at the pregnant woman.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing water out of the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve became hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” the girl’s mother said.
LaBelle banged on the mother -- who was still clinging to Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and removed to a car that was waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking LaBelle for an apology, but she did not get an answer.
LaBelle's attorney and representatives did not return calls to comment on the incident.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer support association.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate Adversity Stopped the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-described of the change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead economic is recorded in the main deterioration.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of the overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in the economic sector, which affected the other sectors.
According to the report of impacts for the ice creams, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops burned were garnets and garnets.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, increased the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March, the number of unemployed was increased by 55,000,053.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
“What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, already for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, and invest them.
Detained Migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails between working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor reserves are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the State FDI amounted to $630 thousand 697, which represents a year-on-year decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million registered.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.28 billion pesos per year, mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic contraction scenario, the state government requested in July the approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be allocated to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was not for 2 million pesos.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ first year of Government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and especially the already synchronized good march of this new government team, we expect more next year.
Economic Slowness
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stated that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expecs.”
Redefining Vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to blame the state for more dynamic productive activities.
“In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the economic vocation and course of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to do
The Coparmex president stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better enacts the government’s efforts.
“In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term programme be developed,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of driving public policy.
“There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the convicted narco-comendist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist was riding in a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the vehicle's box and a small backpack in the copilot's seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was at the disposal of the District Judge and the sentence continues to be handed down within the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
You owe contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk of not having met the State Government with the corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these works becomes effective.
“They are almost 12 million and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they have had to give us a share,” he said, “we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
"We had already passed in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left behind," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite actions so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They’re almost 12 million and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Valid "analogous apag<0xC3><0xB3>n" cut in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have raised against the presidential decree ahead of the so-called “analog blackout” from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed in his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to finalize the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules measures for the public administration to prepare.
“I also do not consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected,” he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, who has constitutional mandate, the state’s rectory.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better utilization of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the change, he argued, would be delaying the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "demand the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectification of the state, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature is being provided.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6,744 total acts.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, yet the corresponding 6 votes are not counted.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be remembered, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, each time that the Congress of the State passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted the plea in the publication of the Oval Office.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative power and called the state president’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal,” as long as he has no right to “sanctify or ban them.”
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI, it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place on the assumption that: the results of the acts do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the file of the box or does not open in the power of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session the candidate is the representative of the petition
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed, in which case the electors will be excluded from the list.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his home town, this Sunday night, during Monday, awards and a requiem Mass were held.
According to his family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute to the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony on the Mars Field.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived the sailing chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was given a recognition at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues of the technological baccalaureate and the American football team, of which he was part Felipe Bacio during his baccalaureate preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and to have his ashes scattered in the mountain of Zapalinamé, he always manifested it to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considering that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and as a dependent of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said it was even raining on the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They give him the last goodbye.
In honor of this, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was sacked in 1985, in honor of the head of the governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, who gave him the people and the government of the state, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, in the study of the Sixth Air Force, and the direct study of the Mexic Air Force.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days when the helicopter that he was piloting, together with the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of that unit.
At 18:05 hours came the remains of the Saltillense Bacio Cortés (creamed), to be delivered by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, in the explanation of the plant, where he was already expected by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his sister.
Three abandoned corpses found on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with a gunshot, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place noticed that in the fifth, whose beige beard is color with coffee, the gate was open from pair to pair.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow beacher with a dark lace pants, without shoes; next to him was another with a white tie beacher.
Just a metre away was the body of another individual with a red beacher and blue pant.
The three of them were sitting face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no helmets were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth there are legends that go from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in it and the gate.
Captured at 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, murders, "halcone" and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information released, in a first instance on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of his freedom.
They were secured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that occurred on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
By marking their height and carrying out the inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda ejido, who on seeing the military tried to flee.
They are assigned clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed the country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well-defined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the beaten-up confidence in Italy.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian boss Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were driven considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary Support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are over.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his repairs in the face of a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish Rock is superior to the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten beat the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convocateurs reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, account for a broad record of class A interselection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one with the 50 international matches.
This figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain an intense activity each year in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
The above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated Euro and World Cup eliminations.
On the other hand, the players have a limited international presence in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Team is from archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the brainstem of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA last week alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke winger, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left side Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and the artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31) are among the most popular.
On the national side, with fewer than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var owns only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic goalscorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two-decade celebration tour
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was stated by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade-long working tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelina band The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live in intensity the previous days.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, they are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us amazed because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us would have imagined that we would be in a big rock band and having done it for more than 20 years ago makes it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love making music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and it’s something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange for a band like yours to stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, on its own, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too toured because it’s easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought, without falling for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and most importantly we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work and have more fun, to play football.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics for Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first things that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, their music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and a family member or friend gets lost, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his chief physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000), suffers several ailments, including a cancer in the tongue for which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, it has an 18 kg weight loss that has been linked to other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has served incarceration since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguay’s president, José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations," the South American presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remain tax havens from the international community, a statement that prompted Uruguay’s rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s “grey list”, made up of countries that did not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted fountain pen passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, but never before had he done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s head of specialized media in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time have greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario incursion also involves the character’s return to a portable console, a fact that hasn’t occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo makes nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting of the bigote fountain will have to travel through mined platforms from danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of ex-Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the $70 million laundering conspiracy.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeys the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentencing had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his term he “did not put his hands” on judicial resolutions and gave way to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an executive proceeding after all judicial and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the former between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the collapse of Q120 million in the Defense Ministry when he was president, which was the process leading up to extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of boys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
To this is added the one hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of doping or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of managers of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Councillor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Mayor and current Ecosocialist Councillor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0> attended the event.
They also visited the large room of the Fabra i Coats the current Welfare and Family Councillor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
An occupied farm has been moved where macro-festivals were made
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare experienced by the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they illegally occupied yesterday afternoon, and where they organized macro parties that were desperate for the neighborhood, on a court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multitudinary parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, according to him, the annoyances are not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks.
The manager of the club explained that the troubles were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he “forgives” the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had called last week "immediately move the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but over the last few months the occupancy had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been thefts.
In this regard, he added that, “it is necessary to end impunity and be blunt against the incisiveness that has been generated on the farm.”
Also yesterday, the Mossos ousted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. police reached 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park the mountain?
Architects agree on the occasion of the convocation beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of Barcelona’s already extinct Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional Easter eggs from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who do not orient themselves on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park gives rise to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors into the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring topic to throw your hand at when two members of this old cast of elected officials are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, think, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB3>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It must start from the base that Barcelona’s most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex,” says the architect for whom the title of "gates of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where one must act".
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertain that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that he had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries over where one can build.
“Limiting something is fixing already the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can set off real disasters.”
More focused on the question, M<0xC3><0xB3>dol believes that, simplifying, the Vallesana side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", because of a purely topographical question.
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he thanks the opportunity that the city council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the salvo conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to create: "The architects should only be a tool.
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the basis of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-contests have been convened in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This results, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the side door architect.
In its view, yes, the city council should ensure that the immediate upper edge of the Dalt Round should provide, to its full extent, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and will come out free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal authority of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After remaining in prison for 72 days, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal authority of the Casino Red granted him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a lawsuit for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
Following the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the regional city council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of Panista and on September 2 was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained in that place for the next 49 days after being given a second rooting order after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penalty for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he only stayed for a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, enough evidence was tested to determine Jonah’s guilt, such as the levy of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house.
On Monday, the legal authority of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, came before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region, so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Ministry agent assigned to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been repaired and who of the betting house’s partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the file 197/2011, Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is granted a legal pardon and in the following no claim can be made about the process followed by him; in addition, he will not be required to repair damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal authority of the betting house, around 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
You will also be notified of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results thrown on the crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter hit the ground directly in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
“The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage.”
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruising speed and that this happened in a soft upward terrain.
“This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,” he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual Flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM located suitable conditions for take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico were presented layers of low-altitude cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudiness conditions the crew sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft's debris allows us to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the crash there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During fieldwork pieces of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,000,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain features a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to be disarticulated along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the moored site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover the Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; Is Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the protocol 'Child and Adolescent Obesity Genetics', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 21st Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research it is invited to participate in the population whether or not right-of-way, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Western Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of East Mexico).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics regarding the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
In celebrating World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he said the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants are applied anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it is sought to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez noted that this research obeys the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in children.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed," the IMSS specialist said.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (canthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
Information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tale, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt to Avoid Bacchus
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a blend with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that send the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 rubble every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the construction process is a muddy and muddy
At its conference A technological opinion of the Baches, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it was announced that the laboratory at its disposal develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of streams.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is being modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt carpet, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating effort, it allows forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt carpet, it abounds, a last layer is placed called the rolling carpet, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the treading folder also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt carpet.
When the ground becomes wet, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a tray, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and therefore the thickness of each layer of the floor must always go in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is met, to prevent frequent bumps from forming.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair the slag easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected so that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of Princess.
Again the Cauca Valley is left with the wishes of the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, shining the silver crown and the band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (1989), where the Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian (1987), Marian), Marian)
Today the big question that many are asking is What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision taken by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the interrogator the Vallecaucana answered:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalization" and second by not specifically explaining how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina revealed to be calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favouritism.
A Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist hinted that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who carried all the preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public’s vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), “that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine in the Queen’s.
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both seemed safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN's "How to Home" program, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain as queen."
In addition, Valle was shown to be very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her father’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one has to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorious, dropped her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit came a cruel Vatican that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the content that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina starts today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her winding pass through Cartagena, was stripped of her crown.
This was the work of the executioner who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a Cali CTI lophoscopist went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top chief: "Alphonso Cano", through the rating of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the sectional of the CTI, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial research for 21 years.
At the start of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> municipalities, where he often had to interned for more than five days in the jungle to get to the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, i.e., of the palms of hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for her.
On Friday night he went out for the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man leading the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz’s decadactilar card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was the chief of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
The recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When captured, many criminals present fake cards or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because at that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not the appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the full hand print and identify the offender, who had participated in different robberies,” he recalled.
The prints can also dismiss or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative might be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does place him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscope expert explained that in the objects "the traces are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplantor or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes imprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective rating is performed.
‘Indignated’ challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under a court order, the Manhattan Square where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the “indigned” to return to camp on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the "indignities" response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the “indigned” proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization said that there were several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved in support of members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation must be analyzed this morning.
Some of the protesters who had been displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed it over to the officers guarding the square, prompting “some small clashes,” said Bray, who reported that some officers had slapped the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the early-morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” as “some businesses had been threatened” and the neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that at the bottom of Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", helper in "Baywatch", "Playboy"'s concubine, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with her then husband, the battery of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding on a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comedian who recently acted as a presenter on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married late March in Buenos Aires to Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a “whisper” during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government encumbered material losses by $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have softened.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the gross domestic product data between July and September was used to pass the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The record for the second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, versus the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted ups.
However, the true upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian momentum that invites us to take advantage of the crises to reinforce – or rebuild – the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a loss on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of economic flotation is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, threw their weak results between July and September at the yen’s price.
As long as markets continue their siege to the peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not lower the guard.
“We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that most member countries presented stronger signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being curbed.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, up from 100.8 in August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when it fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens re-enacts doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums shot down and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entrench itself in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is being imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed on in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that he will not support new measures of austerity in any case.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said, as he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his good visa to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is also no definitive date.
The Greek masonry still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s “predominant” place in relation to this type of finance
Spain “has reached a predominant place globally in the role of Microfinance.”
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a 2015 horizon, and, "very especially, in that which aims to reduce the volume to half"
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the most vulnerable.
They are “many achievements achieved” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is presented not only as a discussion forum, but also as the platform from which to push “two basic goals”.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will come out of the poverty line they are on.
The impetus in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago pioneering" by Muhammad Yunus, highlights Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose connection with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid "the head of the pobladolid".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, he said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez said micro-credits are “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluding those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors solidly."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy militants who believe that government policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine were registered against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, reveal any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
Delegates, on the other hand, rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank’s directive based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany’s weight.
Looking forward to calming the spirits inside her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The Impact of Fraud on Sickness Rates
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government take an offensive against the disease casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential campaign of right, most want to focus on disease casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of shortages on private sector workers before they can catch up.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unemployment without pay in case of low employment (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most people are putting the issue of fraud on the table again, this time geared towards the abuses of low jobs.
"There will be a significant increase in controls and, moreover, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand speaking at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-labour fraud.
In fact, since 2002 there has been a constant follow-up on this issue and various policy offensives have been launched, which have normally resulted.
The French are sick only in the rest of Europe.
First of all, let us look at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for lows accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents rates, while 54% is related to sickness rates, a figure of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5% of the expenditure on health care.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off from work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed they had not taken a single sick day off.
Another study, in this case the Health Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to more than 45 days of systematic control of disease falls.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term lows were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of falls of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and certainly considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos declared on Monday, November 14, before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days that have been granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve such a goal.
“To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as "the country's stay in the euro zone is at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said during a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the goals of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything to the cause.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient makes such a choice and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who are not.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is close to alleviating their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not lead to the understanding that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a trial should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of a patient ' s health care, the situation is not as clear, as indicated by the authors of the report.
In addition, his recommendations suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal from health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of experts signing the report as "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted yesterday with a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "manifist in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly concerned about the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complet"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad protested yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria intensified, which, with Russia’s support, resisted and denounced the existence of a “complot” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has stepped up sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have expressed support for President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has lamented that the mediation efforts Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has celebrated that the “consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” has been “reinforced.”
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was “forwarding towards the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco from his duties, which in his view constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not falter,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s crackdown, which, in his opinion, is locked in “paranoia.”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which foresees, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday condemned the Arab League’s decision as “wrong” while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, though it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include “sacrifices” aimed at regaining lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the unions and the boss.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has spoken of a wide program with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President-designate of the Council.
For his part, House Speaker Gianfranco Fini has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are a few deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that markets will have patience and will understand it."
Its designation by the President initially obtained the benefit of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include “politicians”.
The new government will have to work until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "recovering its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budget balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past months, has called for new austerity measures to be adopted.
Italy’s “boss chief” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “because a country that does not grow can’t meet the deficit requirements.”
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its “serious concern” over a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have declined or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% global increase in anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“Following a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have once again increased,” Human Rights First said in a statement, “increased violence against Muslims is especially significant.”
“Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the head of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new “Activity” tab and another so-called “Name” tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other “Twitts”, that is, of those Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) are still on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before it was broadcast to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poco instinctivo function, con terms ligerentes esotericos (RT para resend un message de otra persona, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a handle more comparable to that of the public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation by striking "tweets" with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,” writes <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a Budgetary "Gold Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Christian/Social-Democratic coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Vice-Chancellor for Democratic Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Constitution.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
It's a strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention of the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again if the yen continued to rise.
“We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen soared to levels close to the historical highs that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rebounding since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a “value refuge” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back to trading on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbol bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it intensifies the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when converted into the national currency.
“Japan is struggling to rebuild itself” after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, which fears that the yen’s rise will cut the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of homes affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “economic bases.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags flounder
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions with regard to the returns on loans from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing concerns from market players regarding Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed outlook in Europe and exchanges will continue to be held in a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates exceed by 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while the Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions with regard to the interest rates in the southern countries, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of choking on the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expected growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favorable than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure for the second quarter down, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
The facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed by taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it studies the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a interrupted power plant after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a speech.
Berlin’s election will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
It is necessary to meditate on the case of Denmark.
Europe’s champion in the wind sector, of which it gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the big users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe’s cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would represent a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic of the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show opposition in principle to that type of energy, according to the polls.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it spans a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-localizable jobs.
If France decides to abandon nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for either people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
As all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant study it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France’s “country of human rights”.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the May 23 Liberation newspaper) declaring from the past that France “does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters.”
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take charge of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus on the impact on migration among the stakeholders.
The restriction of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors with no employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, not to mention the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less expenditures) of 150,000 euros to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his tenure, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which dissipated immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
You need to think about this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a gap in the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take a coup d'état, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that follows the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from their impotence and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-motivated revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chip are generalized
The World Chip Card Show starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global microprocessor card sales (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart’s calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind with regard to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To make the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system,” says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks try to pay by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're backing out."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
iPhones will be matched by around 200 customers and collaborators with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact via their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show they’re cooperating,” he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger last January is said to have resumed.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Aye terrorist
The study of the calls made indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long remained in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and similar Kamikazes or explosive devices as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of illuminators not worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), prompts the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect from the sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and the attacks against the police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-weakened America, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strident foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, aid to Israel are spreading.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America overwhelmed by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, is almost drowned out by an attitude that “embarrasses” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stagnant in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations in relation to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “is trying to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had a military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President contest that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the rushed departure of Iraq’s “boys” and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The people judge in a more positive way Obama’s national security balance, which ended with bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is distrustful of military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the Baltic coast, between orchestral music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the valve steering wheel that controls Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1,224-km-long tunnel connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Land.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 that will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents areas of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow the supply of gas directly to Germany, avoiding the ground passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Strikingly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,” said Fillon during the pipeline’s inauguration, demonstrating to what extent major gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom’s executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: either by valves, or by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project officials gave up on it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to permanently establish itself at sea off its shores.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, carried out by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, Nord Stream, in charge of building and exploiting the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favorable.
After that, Gazprom leased to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of the gas transportation capacities.
“Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% by means of bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coast.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand booklet.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aging over time.
However, the Moleskine booklets with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Milan-based Italian company Modo Modo decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (top skin), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of booklet was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed, has remained far behind.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a booklet with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand encompasses a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Disadvantage?
“No,” said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
“The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“But there’s still a lot to do.”
It should be noted that disabled people continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They usually have a more advanced age: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed the bachelor’s degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the solution to the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of the people progresses, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest figures available, as of 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among the large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have employees with disabilities in their workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
As they face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure this friendly game generates.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the auditorium stage of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forward’s win against Turkey, the Belgian coach has no more than praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," replied Lille's frontman.
As for the contrast between his performances on his team and in the selection, “it’s a whole,” he has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
Not to mention the “pleasure.”
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
Undoubtedly, that will especially reinforce the “special” character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced it recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
In simple terms, Leekens has made reference to " pride" on his part.
"Pride" for playing "a party of gala".
"I'm proud" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento’s Portugal is facing a great deal of optimism at the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game, there was a lack of realism for both teams.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paul Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Sele<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Cup.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the departure match (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk because we haven’t scored outside the home.”
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect the game to be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 EURO”, he has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk because we haven’t scored outside the home,” Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
