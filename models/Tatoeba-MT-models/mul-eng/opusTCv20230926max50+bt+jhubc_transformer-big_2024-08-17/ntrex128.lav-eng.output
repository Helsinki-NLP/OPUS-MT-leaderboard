Members of the Welsh Assembly (Assembly Members — AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as comfortable"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM across the political spectrum worries that it can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group is concerned about "sounds with the words Twp and Pwp".
Readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "right", while "pwp" means "kaka".
Plaid AM pointed out that none of the group was "not satisfied" and has recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to look at the name change, but added that MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "mercy".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the English dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on changing the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on which terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Welsh Government (Government of Wales) granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, which provided broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Speaking of the AM name, the Commission preferred the Welsh Member of Parliament (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM is clearly proposing alternative options, but the fight for agreement can provide a headache for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
AM's final vote on what they will be called will take place when the regulatory acts have been discussed.
The Macedonian people go to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday, whether their national name will be changed to "North Macedonia".
The referendum was organised to resolve the decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of the northern neighbor is impressive for its claims on its territory, and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request for admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, one of the plebiscite’s opponents of the name change, announced that ignoring the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a change of name is simply something that needs to be done in order to enter the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s call to silence, to the churches of Harlem fighting for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to tell, there used to be a bar and a temple on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there's no one, no one else."
He admits that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People nowadays socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer in the neighborhood of the living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking to even the temples, he worries that the money he receives by selling the property will end faster than the expected leaders, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
As a church, he added, it may be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with apartment properties, where people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area will lie down.
"Most of the people who will buy the properties of the apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and with that comes the day when these temples will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who will be attracted to this life will be attracted to this life."
The two temples were built by the White Society, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation who had prayed to God right next door.
The Black Society of St. Martin's Church took over during his blessing John Howard Johnson. He was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, leading a working retail boycott that had refused to accept black bribes at work.
The building was badly damaged by the fire in 1939, but as members of the Johnson family planned to renovate the building, they ordered a game of bells.
His Holiness David Johnson, the son of his father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's Society, proudly called the game "for poor people's calls".
The expert, who played the game of these calls in July, used other words: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tifania Ng (Tiffany Ng) of the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionysius A. Lind (Dionysio A. Lind), who 18 years ago moved to the largest call game in the Church of Riversaid.
Mr Merivezer (Merriweather) said that St. Martin's Society did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s temple reflected the relationship between the assembled architects and builders, some of whom had been involved in the work of the temporal power, while others were the diocese of the episcopal church.
In July, the Council of the Council, made up of temporary leaders, addressed the diocese in writing, fearing that the diocese would "try to pass on costs" to the Council, although the Council had not been involved in the removal of architects and builders from the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Haisivs hurts 13-year-old teenager instead of Omar fish
Haisivs attacked a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday, who sniffed at the ants, and injured him. It was the first day of the ants season, the service said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends on Saturday morning had a baby for about half an hour when they heard that the boy was calling for help, and then with the group he turned to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a passion for captured humor, but then he "understands that the boy is shouting "I'm telling!
I'll tell you!"
All the bones of his keys were torn off," said Hammels, who immediately noticed it when he had reached the boy.
"I beg everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammels.
The boy was taken by air to Reid (Rady) Children's Hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of shark that has been attacked is not known.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles in the free press reported that sharks had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was acknowledged that it was not a species of danger to humans.
Jayls added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the torso.
Officials for investigation time and security purposes for 48 hours closed access to the beaches from Pontob<0xC4><0xAB><0xC4><0x87> (Ponto Beach) in Casablanca (Casablad), to Swami (Swami's) in Ensinitas (Encinitas).
Jays pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to squeeze into the UK beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" goes into attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal store-style beauty products for shelves and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK of more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the big beauty market, which continues to grow, although the trend of fashion goods and household items is decreasing, 11 stores in the country will be tested for such larger beauty products, as well as for all kinds of clothing
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously open to TVs, microwaves and goods for the home.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its offerings in the field of beauty shopping to up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also get more space with brand zones similar to those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its "Boutique" decorative cosmetics line, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger customers in the years to come.
In addition, the fragrance wholesaler "Fragrance Shop" will try the concession in two stores "Sainsbury's", the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be opened in Seliouk (Selly Oak) later.
Shopping on the internet and switching to small grocery purchases every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that commodity trading venues will become increasingly similar to universal stores, as the chain of stores is trying to fight off discount stores "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering greater services beyond the scope of the store.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the branding of goods and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to improve its beauty department and pharmacy ended in a crash.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boats in the early 2000s, but the union escaped after a dispute about how to split the proceeds from pharmacy goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores 3 years ago to the chain owner Celesio, Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Under this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with supplementing the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the environment for consumers, we have transformed the look of our beauty products and the impact they make.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
The range of our brands is designed to suit all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now an exciting target on the road to beauty, a goal that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter Johns 'full of nothingness' after Holliia Wiloubia quits the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "takes over the fun" after TV host Holly Willoughby turned down the deal with his lifestyle brand "to pay all attention to the new"
Wilubians do not have time to devote their home clothes and accessories to the brand "Truly".
Two businesses were compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning", a 37-year-old broadcast manager used Instagram to announce that she was going away.
Hollija Viloubia has forgotten "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones cooked up in anger, because at the last moment she stepped out of his enterprising lifestyle brand business — to pay all attention to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer.
Information sources claim that Jones was "full of nothingness" when a TV golden girl was forced to attend a meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where she announced that her young brides had a wedding ring, which is worth 1.5 per cent.
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Platrov brand "Goop", and, according to the house, it will double the wealth of Wiloubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) used Instagram to announce leaving "True", Jones moved away from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of the information says: ""True" was itself a top priority for Holly.
It had to become her long-term future, to which she would be dedicated in the coming decades.
Her decision to resign surprised all those who were not involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
There is a full warehouse in the center of Marlova for sale of ready-made goods."
Experts believe that the manager of "This Morning", who is one of the most financially profitable stars, going away can pay the company millions, because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from pillows and candles, to more clothes and clothes.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoubia's mother and her husband Dens Baldwin (Dan Baldwin) have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoubia "True" was founded in 2016 with Kep, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the Baldwin TV producer company.
Wilubian must become the M&S ambassador of the brand, and she will replace Ent McPartlin as head of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business deal!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies about a comment that some may deem "unpleasant to the president" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is the president so much of what he has refused?
Trump said in his image in the voice of the "dictator of news."
"I'm unatteicos not from any!"
He pointed out that Kim has shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea’s top diplomats, Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho), informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not seeing a “response” to North Korea’s response to North Korea’s backlash.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was a lot more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results — the cessation of missile testing tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to make an impression on the president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this densely populated territory, we have 200, look, here," Trump said, pointing to the effort right in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake set an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
While more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so this is a known problem," said Ms Sumbanga (Sumbang).
While "Gl<0xC3><0xA1>biet k<0xC3><0xA1>blis" collects groups for driving to P<0xC3><0xA1>lu, it is still not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work there.
The representative of the national disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pula to see if the international agencies would be able to make their contribution.
In view of the fact that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely vulnerable to drought.
Although Aceh (Aceh) has been created for tsunamis, they are rarely found along other shores.
Most likely, human damage was also affected by the fact that Palu did not echo the warning siren about the tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favourable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had once been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is now going to Pula, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new postage.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of the collapsed infrastructure of Indonesia a central point in his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has fuelled the administration of Mr. Joko, and his re-election is expected next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with the longstanding problem caused by the tension between sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: "Liverpool" player Daniels Stari<0xC4><0xBE>s with a goal restores the balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, winning the goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
The striker received a touchdown from Jordan Shakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), being about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea gates when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then threw the ball further in the direction of the gate pole.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
At the end of the ball passed to the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in the jump and landed on the net.
"I was just trying to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I'm just trying to get myself as much time as possible," Stari<0xC5><0xBE>s explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, striking the ball, and, without much thought, the game."
In the "Chelsea" halftime, the team was led by 1:0 after the words were given by the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
"Blues" striker played the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> (Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>ic), before turning to the middle of the field and maximally quickly falling on the side of the Liverpool field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful match between the players, allowing Azardam to get into the zone.
Azards overcame the rapid defense and finished the combination, with his left leg making a comet on the far pole network, missed "Liverpool" by Elison Becker.
"Liverpool" in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, at 3 p.m. "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will compete with "Napoli".
"Chelsea" with "Videoton" will be in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832 people
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia has reached 832, the state disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people have been trapped in the rubble of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) of high waves, the agency’s representative Sutopo Purhovo Nugro informed at the news conference.
The town of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, covered the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police suspect in rape of woman arrested 32-year-old man
An investigation into the blindness was launched after a woman’s body was found today in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old victim with a stab wound was found at 7.55 a.m., Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The police have called for people in this area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have something fixed in the materials of their car video recorders, to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenheda, and she was found on her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found today.
The investigation will continue, and as informed by the police, they are engaged in in informing the relatives of the deceased.
The taxi driver, who lives in Greisonmjoze, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter the building or leave it.
He couldn’t say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard how a police officer told a man that the whole neighborhood is perceived as a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She goes on to say, "It's so horrible!"
In the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one was located right outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the multi-apartment house.
All who have information, until 30 September are asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by calling 247 on 0800 555 111.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament becomes the latest "rewriting of history" scandal
The withdrawal from it would be ethically justified in the light of Taliban-like activities, as a result of which his fanatical puritanical followers have broken down so many monuments of English culture and religion.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure would also become the target outside Westminster Castle.
Cromwell himself neither ordered to carry out nor carried out the celebration of the feast during the English Civil War.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful depiction of Cromwell is a 19th-century view and is part of the historiography of a person who, as many believe, is still worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's many — perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century — considered Parliament's defence against external pressure, which in his case, of course, was a monarchy.
Historical discussions will continue on whether this is indeed a completely accurate representation of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality, representing one of the parties to the long-standing divide.
What she achieved, being a protector of the Lord, is worthy of praise and mention."
Chicken-slip to death saplos of farmers in China
According to information in local media, a pig on the market in the southwest of China attacked the farmer and killed him.
The man — only his name is mentioned Yuan — was found dead with an artery crossed, all in one blood near the pork market in Liupanshui (Liupanshui) Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, he is preparing to inject the vaccine into a swine herd in Xining, China's Xinhai province.
It is reported that he and his brother-in-law had left the neighbouring province of Junna<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found the man dead and discovered that the door of the pigeon next to him was standing open.
He told me that there was a big pig man with blood on his mouth in the pig’s womb.
According to the information, the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (<0x7E>249 kg) of severe wepris had broken up the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and bloodied," said the brother — only his name is mentioned Vu (Wu), writes "Guiyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan<0xC5><0x86>s entered the market on Thursday at about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juana did not belong to him or to his brother.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the Webris was turned on to prevent its attacks on others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information Juan<0xC5><0x86>a's family and market management discuss the compensation for his death.
While such cases are rare, other types of pig attacks are known to humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, as a result of which the man was critically injured.
Even 10 years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds (<0x7E>295 kg) in Wales kept a farmer pressed to the tractor, until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon fed his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba CBC News explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gunshot".
"They're just playful.
They like to dive, they are very scientific ... they do not want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of the Orkana Rose brings a broad and strong case in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Roza, heading over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will bring flood-prone greenhouse gases to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
On the fifth afternoon (after the time of North America East) the wind gusts of the Rose reached 143 km/h (85 km/h) corresponding to the Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low pressure ridge is formed, moving eastwards, towards the U.S. east coast. Roses with tropical storm force approaching the middle of Baja California, on Monday it will start to mass moisture deep from the tropical belt up to the northwards of the U.S.
Rose Monday in part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25,4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the impending low-pressure flood, will create a vast, powerful rain-gas zone in the Southwest in the coming days.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2,6–10,2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, landslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Wetness deep in the tropics will cause rain gas, which will reach 2–3 inches (<0x7E>5,1–7,6 cm) per hour in individual locations, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5,2-10,1 cm) of rain is expected.
There is possible sudden flooding with a rapid deterioration of the condition due to the spread of tropical rainwater.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert feet due to the threat of tropical rain gas.
Strong rains can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but will not bring local gusts of wind and sandstorms.
The low-pressure decking will bring the local strong stuff closer to the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of rain gas, which together will exceed half a inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm), and this can cause small duvet flows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first greenhouse gas in the wet season.
Separately distributed tropical rainwater to Arizona will begin to approach late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will take over the wider territory late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last throughout Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the U.S., as temperatures in the Arctic are dropping, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in the temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of a dramatic temperature difference on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Old Town and Demo (Des Moines), Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the long-term summer heat will try to develop and expand.
It is expected that in much of the central and eastern part of the U.S. the beginning of October will be warm, reaching temperatures of 80 and more degrees (after Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees after Celsius) in broad areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (after Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees after Celsius), which would exceed the average of about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate that there is a high probability that in the first half of October temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed average.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in Brett Caven's case
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels on Thursday with excitement, according to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual assault in the past 20 years.
Meanwhile, the political undecided continued, interrupting broadcasters' regular broadcasts to report on the latest turnaround in Friday's events: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement to investigate the FIB week's allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that Caveno had buried him in his drink and tried to take off his clothes during a high school party.
Kaveno unambiguously testified that he was completely convinced that it did not happen.
According to the Nielsen report, 20.4 million people watched it all on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, "Fox News Channel" and MSNBC recorded the interests of the average audience.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually comes up with problems, counting people who are in the office watching.
To get a better idea, this number of spectators corresponds to the number of spectators of the exclusion game or the "Oscar" ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million during a full-day listening session, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, and CNN – 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Fleik was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for Caveno, the senator noticed on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by a protester's hotline, tried to reach the hearing of the Justice Committee with a lift.
In a CNN broadcast, he stood for several minutes with his eyes closed as if he were tired.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "the yoke belongs to the power, as long as so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, informed him that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected on the live broadcast several hours later, when the Justice Committee was preparing to vote on the nomination of Caveno for the vote in the Senate.
However, Fleiks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would look at the allegations made against the candidate next week, which has been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleiku was partially convinced of the talks with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After negotiations with K<0xC5><0xAB>ns and several other senators, Fleik made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has instructed the FIB to investigate the charges brought against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
Britain's Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and the crushing of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to an interview with his newspaper on the first page, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan on Britain's future relationship with the European Union, its so-called "Chequers plan", stressing that the EU's proposal is "a compromise"
Form of Sims shooting: police have arrested Ditheon Simpson, suspected there of murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Diteon Simpson (Dyteon Simpson) was arrested and arrested on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police station said.
Officials posted a video showing Sims' collision with Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that the police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson's arrest, the police informed him that he had been found dead in the shooting of the Beast.
According to a lawyer, he was given $350,000 in high-security money.
On Friday, a team of medical experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish (East Baton Rouge Parish) court issued a provisional ruling stating that the death was caused by a gunshot to the head that touched the neck.
The Department is appealing to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the locals for assistance in the investigation, which resulted in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the territory's law enforcement for his "probability and work in the name of justice".
Simss was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (<0x7E>1.98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
In the last season in a single game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by the death of Veida.
"That's what a person is always worried about," said Form.
Vulcan spits ass across Mexico
The volcano, which rises from the Pokatepetl volcano, has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital city.
After an activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The Centre observed repeated fertilization and squabbling.
Images on social media showed that car windshields in the Mexican area, such as Hochimilco, are covered with a layer of flat ash.
Geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the activation of the current volcano in the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after an independency-supporting protester clash with the police and when thousands joined anti-government demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote to secede.
The group’s masked supporters, who were detained by the police of public order, ambushed them with eggs and burned powdery paint, forming dark dust clouds in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
The disagreements arose later on, and the police used sticks to stop the mobs.
Several hours of independence support groups chanting: "Don't forget and don't apologize!" were involved in a confrontation with unity-supporting protesters who chanted: "Long live Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were provided with medical assistance because of the small trauma they received during the protests.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal, but which the Catalans praised, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a great tension.
Voters strongly expressed their independence, even though voter activity was low, and those who were opposed to separation largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalonian officials, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, and there were vicious clashes.
The independence-supporting groups had been deployed on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different route.
Narkiss Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, acknowledged that he no longer wants Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year, as many of the most famous leaders have either failed to emigrate or failed to emigrate.
The 42-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, who filmed a protest on the phone in support of police, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians from both sides.
"The pressure is getting bigger and bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriol Junqueras, who has been in detention since the previous year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to uncover the democratic values of the regression and repression that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after getting into a car in a building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly shot at a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Balinagardkre<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>enta (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings (Bob Blemmings) informed that the doors and also the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the car was simultaneously fired from the barrel.
Mengas hit allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollia Menga (Dolly Menga) gave Livingston a victory
Supported by Livingston, the Rangers stunned Steven Gerrard by giving him his second loss in 18 games, which was taken over as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dollie Meng's victory proved decisive, as the team of Geria Holt equated the situation with Hibernian.
The Gerard team did not win this season of the championship, and the following Sunday they have to meet with the leader "Hearts", from which they remain for eight points.
Before that, on Thursday in the European League, "Rangers" was taken by Vienna "Rapid".
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his series without losses in the division to six games, and head coach Holts still hasn't felt the taste of a knockout since he replaced Kenny Miller in the previous month.
"Livingston" does not take advantage of the opportunity against dull guests
Holta team with their direct game, which in a variety of ways made the "Rangers" difficult, had to be in charge long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow (Alan Lithgow) tried to slip into the leg to prevent the left-hand Halket (Craig Halkett) from hitting the head across the gate.
The owners allowed "Rangers" to play in front of him, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that’s exactly how the decisive gates came about.
The Rangers allowed the freeway, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Galagers (Declan Gallagher) and Robinsons merged to provide an opportunity for Meng to sit and get the gates from the middle of the area.
At this stage "Rangers" managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not disturb anyone.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) led Kelly to save the gates.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the efforts of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithuania missed the gates in the Livingston combination.
In the Livingston area, centred balls continued to appear, but two calls for a penalty — after Halket's fight for the ball with Glenn Middleton and for playing with his hand — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamonts (Alasdair Lamont) "Tony Macaroni" arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to exceed expectations, constantly improving their performance.
Their style of play and personality have practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but Holts has earned a great reputation for how he has led the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett (Halkett) was a giant in maintaining a first-class organized defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Voral (Joe Worrall) were always on guard.
But "Rangers" is lacking in inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they entered the farm area — and it’s essentially a wake-up call for the ‘Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne awaits with shared feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police, as a reason to undermine security, blocked a large effort of 25,000 people, not allowing to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — a large part of them Kurdish — also made themselves known by condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to take him to their own.
The mutual protests of the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guest, some of whom are considered by the German Turk as a hero, while others are portrayed as autocrats.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist was killed.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, at the road stage with intense traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m. BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and the doctor gave help, but the man was at the scene of the peace.
The crash took place several months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Sunday, when the driver left the crash site.
The Metropolitan Police Service announced that the police officers are engaged in identifying the man and informing his relatives.
At the place of the event there are closed roads and buses, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six workers injured in emergency
The Prison Board (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in a riot in a men's strict-regime prison.
The riots broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and will continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight inmates who are confined in one wing, the staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved.
The workers were treated with mild facial trauma at the site of the event.
A prison official said: "In order to resolve the incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance because of the trauma.
We are not satisfied with the violence in our prisons and we are clearly saying that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated in the hospital after a prisoner's attack.
And last October, the workers responsible for the control of the dumps were sent to prison to solve serious irregularities in which the personnel had been attacked with a billion-dollar bomb.
Hurricane Rosa Feniks, Las Vegas and Soltleixitia are at risk of sudden floods (possibly benefiting from drought-affected areas)
Arizona suffers from tropical depression infrequently, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Roza with the remaining force will move across the deserts, creating a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning for sudden rains on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, in the south-eastern part of California, in Las Vegas, and in the south-eastern part of the state of Florida, in the south-eastern part of the state of Florida.
It is expected that on Tuesday, Rosa will be heading directly across Phoenix, arriving with the case late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter said that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Kathryn (1967) was an hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of the AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rain gas, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in individual locations.
Other southwestern areas, including the central part of the Klin<0xC5><0xA1>u Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1–2 inches (<0x7E>2.54–5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in individual locations.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rose rain can become a blessing, as the region has been visited by drought.
While the possibility of flooding causes very serious concerns, some of the storms will probably come in handy, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First of all, the Rose Road leads to the Peninsula of Baja California in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose still with hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eizenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) south.
The wind meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore experienced.
Therefore, it is expected that the hurricane with tropical storm force will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the part of the natural gas, Mexico can be strong, creating a significant flood risk.
"It is expected that the rain gas will reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from Lejas california in the southwest of Sonora, with precipitation possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rose will move north across Mexico like a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning like a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and arrive in the South Juta on Tuesday late at night.
"The main threat that is expected from the Rosas or its remnants is very strong rain gas in Lower California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that this rain will cause life-threatening sudden floods and landslides in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack of Midsommer Norton: four arrested for attempted kidnapping
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4.00 a.m. BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
Police reported that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Evona and Somerset.
The police have called for anyone who could have access to mobile phone material about what happened.
Trump says Kaveno is a victim of the Democratic Party's "evil and angry"
"The vote on Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the vicious and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Caveno is a victim of the Democratic Party's "evil and angry" throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno testified before Congress, where he energetically and emotionally denied any allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of the hearing about his accusations.
The President announced on Saturday that on that day "Americans saw" Caveno's "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a history of excellence in the service of the people," he told supporters in West Virginia.
The nomination of President Kaveno mentioned the environment, talking about the importance of Republican activity in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I didn't run, but I actually ran," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump objected that Democrats have undertaken a mission "to protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Caveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people had been killed, many simply wiped out when giant waves were hitting the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the city of Pau on the beach, where up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves were shaking against the beach chair, many of them dying and burying all who were on their way.
Cunami rose after a 7.5-point powerful earthquake.
“When a tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still working on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of India’s disaster relief agency, told reporters in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, it brought cars, beams and buildings, it carried everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"A lot of people crawled into the coconuts to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs taken on the plane of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and broken bridges, and a water-covered mosque.
In the afternoon, the coastal cities continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the Friday massive earthquake exceeded the energy of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima about 200 times during World War II.
The location of the city is long, at the end of the narrow bay possibly increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's posts were described as "wide", and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number and number of casualties could be higher along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "were completely broken, no information was received from the Dongal," informed Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to disaster-stricken regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami had visited Pala, although officials claimed that the waves came at the time of the warning announcement.
A video posted on social media shows that the man on the upper floor of the building is desperately calling people on the street below that approaching the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, scalding buildings and machines.
The news agency "Reuters" was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe loss of electricity supply, which shut down communications to Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials have announced that the army has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still require very much food and other first-time necessities.
The city's airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Doseba) said that the staff of World Vision, who had successfully arrived from Dongala (Donggala) in the city of Pau, and now had a brezent in the yard of the office, had gone through the streets of the fast lanes.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups have deliberately started to organise aid for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and personnel from overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the postal territory is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross representative Aulia Ariani (Aulia Arriani).
"When the government announces, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but such status has not yet been established."
When Pal arrived the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, still undiscovered human friends and family members continued to hope that their loved ones would become wonders that make life brighter during a natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the notebook.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, next to her mother’s corpse.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the hotel "Roa Roa", including Mr. Mandigi (Mandigi), were his pets.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I teach emotion to the nose."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paraglider team, he sent messages for hours on the WhatsApp to the participants of the Palu competition who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
Zag<0xC4><0xBC>i steals $26,750 at Newport on the Levee complex during ATM filling
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the bodies were stolen Friday morning from a $26,750 "Brink's" employee who filled a ATM at the "Newport on the Levee" complex.
"The driver of the car was running out of the entertainment complex ATM and was preparing to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "attended the employee of "Brink's" from behind" and stole a bag of cash with a ATM.
According to the press release, witnesses observed several suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanje Vests: reperis changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje Vests changes its name to Ye (Je).
Noting the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "There are people who previously know as Kanji Vestu."
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time, and used the nickname as his eighth album, which was released in June, the name ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
These creators say that he replaces the singer Arianu Grandi on the show, who interrupted the work "emotional causes".
Vests has said that this is not only a shortening of his current professional name, but it also has a religious significance.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," Vests explained earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
In the beginning there was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought of good and bad in us, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who had previously been known as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he prefers the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother of Love).
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, both have and have not used a mind sign and big letters.
President-elect of Mexico says he will not use the army against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty repayment of students is approaching.
Lopes Obradors on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The peaceful demonstration of the army unit was staged on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America.
Lopess Obradors has vowed to support young Mexicans in the coming years by issuing grants to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on "Google", "Mi",
The comments were made after the various U.S. government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks strategies in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a major country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so very backward in the US, and the next cardinal shift in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Li said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New Order of the World") was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has just invested
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegi-Melon) he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that surpassed America's best "Othello" (Reversi) player, but later he was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the CEO of Google.
Li acknowledged the previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the idea of a human being could be identified as a human being.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Li said.
"It is not China that disappoints the leading scientists, but the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have become accustomed to working with artificial intelligence in the last few years at universities.
He added that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Li explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people by academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. Department of Defense) established a joint artificial intelligence center, which is intended to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee of inquiry.
And this month DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Department of Defense) announced a $2 billion investment initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, the task of which was to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been working for several months.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic" by taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbor’s name is indicative of claims to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June, which was based on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists insist that the changes affect the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns as to whether voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendums to be recognised as valid.
The referendum ticket asks the question: "Are you about NATO and EU membership by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev (NATO), argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of South Slavia, becoming a member of an organisation such as the EU.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be needed in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no violations had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I'm going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs, his wife Zorika (Zorica) and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko (Dushko) voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, took place in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a small stage and arranged the chairs at the tents, which had been set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to step in with our heads raised, not through the doors of the servants," Kavadarkovs said.
“We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China or Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zajevs says that NATO's participation will start with the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia), it is clear that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than what is needed.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, it was found that 57 percent of the voters planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
Manchestras "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) is cleared through the entire "Brighton" defense to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling (Raheem Sterling) won the Brighton defence by allowing Manchester City to win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England by 2:0.
Agvero was impressed that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentinian striker received a touch in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He slipped between the three "Brighton" guards, and was thrown into a free field.
Then Agvero wore four green shirts.
He wrapped the ball for one defense, then skided over several more "Brighton" on the edge of the field.
Then he made a pass on the left, reaching Sterling.
The attacker of the English centre used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put in a good football shoe to reach the "Brigton" goalkeeper Metj<0xC5><0xAB> Raien<0xC5><0xAB> (Mathew Ryan) by hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," "City" manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he got the gates at the time.
But it was Sterling who provided the Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League race.
The gate was opened in the 29th minute.
Avero in the game received the ball deep in the territory of "Brighton".
He sent the ball with a beautiful bang along Leroy Sane's left leg.
In Sane he made several hits until he entrusted Sterling to deliver the ball to the nearest gate staff.
The attacker of the Sky Blues center easily spotted the ball in the network just before crossing the border.
"City" will compete with the Hoffenheim Champions League group on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at the stadium "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" in Zinshaima, Germany.
Hearts wants to provide problems "Rockies"
Since "Nationals" does not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart yet.
But Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against the Colorado "Rockies" on Sunday, but only if the "Rockies" will be up-to-date exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National League of the West group is in charge of a single game against Los Angeles
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with Friday night with a 5:2 win over "Nationals", but still has not won their first title in the division.
"Although we're playing the same game, we'll at least be able to have fun knowing that the airfield here in Denver, with the effort and the other team, will probably be the worst I'm ever going to touch this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as a message, is ready to let Shercer take a shot.
Chercer, for whom it will be the beginning of 34, held a shooting session on Thursday in the outdoor part of the "bullpen", and on Sunday, during the usual rest time, the ball will be fired.
"Washington" Labrocis is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strokes for 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Is Doing Myths in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kaveno, has been involved, while at the same time talking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is in danger.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't run, but in fact I ran, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of democrats who are acting right now.
And they are committed to regaining power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, the opposite of action.
They don’t care what they blame, what they have to go through to get power and control, that’s why they want to get power and control, and we don’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission "to protest and resist".
"And you yourself have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "successful, evil, accidental, and untrue."
On behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he named the Democratic Party Senator Diane Feinstein, to which viewers responded with loud apologies.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait — it was a really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerable to those who have been exposed.
It was no wonder that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be censored.
After all, I am until now the last member of the Labour Party who informed me that he was not wanted, that is all because we do not hide our opinion.
With my fellow Members in Parliament, Joan Ryan, she was a bit like that, because she was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing to Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, of national security, of Europe is ironic, but those were issues where Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In a statement on the meeting of the Labour Party in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my eight years as a member of the local Leiborist Parliament were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the airport is different and promises of a "better, healthier" policy have long been forgotten if such has ever been the case.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to have different opinions, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions, which I would never agree to in other cases, nor would I dare to do so.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying - there's a rumor about using social media, calling for a ban on running for the next election, hiding the centre's policy, claiming I don't have a seat in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have more success than some of my fellow Members, because the comments I make are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who face the stream of sexist and racist grievances every day, but never try to avoid submission.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal its use has become.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn announced that the Leiborist Party must plunder the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of views and with every expression of mistrust or change of the rules of selection, the party will narrow down.
During the last two years I have often provided advice to myself, inviting me not to go to the toilet, think what I was talking about, and then with me "everyone will be fine".
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined the Leiborists 32 years ago as a schoolboy, in response to the failure of the Te<0xC4><0x8D>era government, which my integrated school class had literally led to collapse, I have set the task of fighting for better public services for those who have the most common interests.
I have never hidden my political views, not even the previous election.
No one in the East of Nottingham had reason to doubt my position on policy issues and areas where I would not agree with the existing government.
For those who moved the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is resolutely moving towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to say is that it is not Notingema's "Momentum", but to their constituents whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I pledge that there is no threat of running for office, or that there are no reminders in politics, that there are none of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Uncomplicated "Ayr" reaches the highest row in the table
The last two attempts may seem to some extent a final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has deserved to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unsaid team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the use of much better spending that drove the owners, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tested all of our games and we're still not connected, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie (Robyn Christie): "All the honours of "Ayr", they used their advantage better than we did."
In the 14th minute, the attempt by Grant Anderson, made by Freziers Klimo (Frazier Climo), was made by "Ayr", but the yellow card was given to the Scottish captain Rory Hj<0xC5><0xAB> (Rory Hughes), where the game was awarded "Warriors", changed by "Jargos Beelrose".
The climb increased the control of "Ayr" with a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he got points, then carried out a solo attempt, so in the break of "Ayr" he went with 17-5.
However, the "Melrose" halftime started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was realized by Begots, reduced the rebound to 5 points.
Then there was a long pause, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe trauma and was taken away from the field, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly moved forward, when Stafords Makdovels (Stafford McDowall) moved on.
Ayr's former captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used a lean player - with the attempt of Bruce Colvine, which had not been realized.
However, the owners clashed, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for crossing the Klimo without a ball from the soda corridor, Makferson made a touchdown "Ayr" at the back of the spring.
Klimo made the ball, just like before, almost from the very start after Kyle Rowe turned over to David Armstrong in the field of play and sent the flanker to Gregor Henry's farm in the fifth month.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game", Ford Kieran, seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business, as he has revealed that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the show will be the last of its ninth season, and Kyrnan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kiernan planned to engage in the "floating restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, trapped in the land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines patrol around the docked Fleet headquarters in Lapa.
Social buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The fleet's base ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are crossed with a motto: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In a landlocked Bolivia, memories of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century about the lost shoreline of resources are still alive, just as long as the ship is still in the Pacific.
These expectations are likely to be the highest for several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many Bolivians are watching the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after several decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile's obligation to discuss the sovereignty of the province
Bolivian charismatic local president Evo Morales, who is looking forward to the controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's ruling.
"We're close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he said, enthusiastically at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court ruling in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and, even if it is adopted, major changes are not expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chile's territory, and its representatives have stated that the outcome of the negotiations will not be determined.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is adopted no more than six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained the international regulatory expert Paz Zarate from Chile.
And over the last four years, the Bolivian case has not moved forward, but, on the contrary, has stalled.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales’s military rhetoric is that the Chileans have tempered the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged shipments since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Edvardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze (Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze), did not agree that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "apply the point of 139 years of long-standing conflicts from which both sides will come," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used sea problems as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its rights to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to wonder what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons when it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never first dispose of their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Her comments were echoed at a time when it seems that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is ready to resume diplomatic measures on the road to nuclear deterrence, more than three months after Singapore’s meeting with North Korea.
Ri says that they are "fantasy" to hope that the United States still does not lift sanctions and does not want to declare the end of the Korean War will ever leave North Korea on its way.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant retaliatory measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the military, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris fashion show introduces you to the latest massive headline line on your way to the nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced viewers with a line of absurd, huge head-to-head items at the Spring/Summer 2019 season collection, which swirled against the Paris Fashion Week’s style background.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded "Instagram" this spring, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to demonstrate fashion.
The most outstanding creation of Valentino was a beautiful sand-coloured hat carved with colors similar to a wide edge, which twisted heads.
Among the massive accessories were gemstones, magic hats and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Braun also showed a strange selection of masks —just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had swollen lips, and they were rather added to Hanibalam Lecter, rather than to high fashion.
One of the formations was reminiscent of the demolition of the breathing mind, with pipes and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of dried ice cream.
And if you want to continue in mass fashion, then the right time has come.
Style viewers believe that huge crowds may be on their way to your nearest High Street.
Large-sized hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — salmon hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The very impractical status of hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another great creation on the tongue — the salmon beach bag, almost as big as the model worn in the swimsuit who wears it.
The red-yellow Rafia bag, decorated with Rafia bars and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the spring/summer season collection "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in Paris Fashion Week 2019.
Famed designer Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a huge impression on the audience that it will be difficult to ignore them."
John Edwards: Knowledge of language is essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have an excellent reputation for educational institutions, and it has retained it in 2018, when the results of the excellent examinations were obtained this time, which are further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sport, in art music and in other societies.
The aim of this school, which has a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to provide the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their pupils for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their life as citizens of the world.
As the education sector, which can develop and implement special school programs, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his mind.
If you speak in his native language, it stays in his heart.”
This is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and gain people's trust from other countries.
Taking into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the highest number of exams completed in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The Scottish Independent Schools Council’s data on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest grade in Chinese A, and also 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned French, and 63 percent who learned French.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is a foreign language as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice, independent school programs are rated as high as the subjects of the Science-Technology-Engineering-Science and Mathematics (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) group.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for the inability to fill vacancies.
Therefore, more and more often, language skills become mandatory in order to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
With the increase in job opportunities that will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by acquiring a foreign language, they will gain in the future the real advantage provided by such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the multi-language spoken competitiveness.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, but the French language was the only one that spoke a double-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to make a contribution to the learning of languages.
Several languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will give children a better chance of meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common modern languages, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the UK's future, according to plans by 2020.
Whatever your child will be interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the relevant field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children, and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success for someone to have a future.
At present, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It must be done well (it must be done).
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron makes his debut as Lakers on Sunday in Sandjego
Fans have finally waited for the moment when LeBron's first game will take place in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday before the season's opening game against Denver's "Nuggets" Sandjego.
But you still have to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed the Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Michael Trudell) tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing the practice started this week, James asked about his plans for the Lakers six pre-season games series.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's headline in West Virginia's event time, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of headlines today in Vilinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five myths planned for Trampl next week, including stopping at friendly places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Mr Trump's aim is to get support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control after the vote in Congress in November.
What will be the fate of Trump in West Virginia today, and how will he be able to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Vilinga, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s headlines in West Virginia online on YouTube.
It is believed that Trump is running for hearing this week in the case of Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno, who has been accused of sexual offences, and the Senate vote is expected to postpone approval for a week until the end of the FI.
However, the main objective of this myth is to help improve the situation for Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign shows that this next week’s task of five headlines is to “activate volunteers and supporters as long as Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Congress control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible, because we are launching an active campaign season," a Trump campaign representative who declined to reveal his name told Reuters.
This evening's headline, which is scheduled for "Wesbanco Arena" in Villain, will likely attract supporters from "Ohaijo and Pennsylvania, and it will be reflected in Pittsburgh's media," reads "West Virginia Metro News."
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey (Patrick Morrisey) of West Virginia, who remains in line with the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president needs to come in to help improve his poll results," Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: The U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to fighting to keep high hopes for Sunday’s singles games
After three sessions "in one word" on Wednesday afternoon in the format of the game "foursome" probably was exactly what was needed for this Raider's caucus.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations in success, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, on which side of his mind is he now a success?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, because I think it means in its own way that success has been directed at us," Jordan Spieth said as he walked in.
Europe, of course, has a preference, as it is managed by 4 points, but another 12 will be played.
Spitt explained that Americans believe that the wind blows their powers and they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
The spear has been destroyed from the first spot to the grass, and is an example of the winner.
Those gustular winning calls became louder and louder as his round continued, a decisive blow was made in the berth to four times reach the same number of blows when he and Thomas were back on two blows after two.
His hit in the bet that reached his victory 15 was perceived with a similar call, from them, for his belief that the American team has not yet been pushed out.
"You really have to yell deeply, and you have to worry about your sword," Spit said.
This is all that will remain for these players.
18 tricks to be successful.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are the Franciscan Molinaries (Francesco Molinari) and Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood), who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
The European strange but attractive pair is left behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Molivud was the only couple who went without a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and in the last nine berths on Friday morning.
This stream and the way their energy flows to this disturbing effort and back convinces that they are the players who have to win on Sunday, and Flintwood with Molinari will be the most popular players that can ensure a potential European victory when the sun defeats the National Golf.
We want both at the same time in different dorms.
However, the talks on the European triumph were premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpsons quickly came to terms with this morning's hero "fourballs" in the format of Sergio Garcia, who played alongside Alex Norena (Alex Noren).
Bogy and the two doubles in the front nine brought the Spaniards and the Swedes in the chain, and they were not even close to being heard from them.
But on Sunday there is no one to help you get through.
In the formats of the game "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch in the vicinity due to the interaction of the couple, watching what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days is in a far-flung lead, but this competition in the format of "foursome" showed that the US team is committed to fighting, which many, especially the "Stateside", have doubted.
The last day of the Raider Cup is in the lead 10-6
The European selection of the Raider Cup will start on a pleasant day in the lead after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" competitions ended in the lead with 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired by the pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Fran<0xC3><0xA7>esco Molinari, the two-way lead over hard-working Tiger Woods, who increased the number of points to four.
Thomas Bjorn (Tomas Bjorn) the European team to keep the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning competitions in the format of "fourballs", and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. more energetically opposed the "foursomes" format, winning two matches, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs 8 points in Sunday’s 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Flintwood is the first European freshman to earn four points in a row with Molin<0xC3><0xA1>ri, named Molliwood after a sensational weeknight is just the second pair in the history of the Raiders Cup, which earned four points in the first four matches.
In the "fourballs" format of the match between Wood and Patrick Reed, they then easily hit the tired Wood and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sensitive result 5&4.
Wood, who won two games on Saturday, for a while showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of 29 matches in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, in addition to seven in a row.
Justin Rose (Justin Rose) takes a break before the morning games "fourballs", returns to partner Henrik Stenson (Henrik Stenson) "foursomes" to connect with 2&1 Dustin Johnson (Dustin Johnson) and Brooks Kepku (Brooks Koepka), who take the first and second place in the world.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, although the day was a pleasant and mild breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competitions Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored 2&1 against Spanish John Ram (Jon Rahm) and Ian Polter (Ian Poulter) in "fourballs" format and returned later to tie Polter and Rory McIlroy (Rory McIlroy) with 4&3 "foursomes" after having previously lost
Only twice in the history of the Raider Cup, the team has played 4 points in deficit singles, but as the owners, the team of Farika (Furyk) is enough only with an indistinguishable result to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, it looks like Sunday’s counter-attack will be problematic.
North Korea has announced that it will not retaliate unilaterally in "no" case, without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States, and in no case will North Korea unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken "significant steps of good will" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the denuclearisation of nuclear weapons.
"However, we do not see a proper response from the US," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally retaliate first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known reluctance to oppose Washington's "gradual" approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea will be rewarded for steps taken gradually, his statement left an impression, as it did not automatically derailed.
Ri recalled the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to achieve the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump vowed to guarantee the pledge.
North Korea has been trying to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not acceded to the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "denuclearization must be first," and raises the level of pressure created by sanctions to achieve the goal with power, even in opposition to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could push us on the road is empty fantasies that people who don’t know about us know about.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Mr Ri did not talk about his intentions regarding Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned in a speech at the United Nations this week.
The minister in his speech specifically highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in during the last five months and added: "If the other side in this denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, not the Korean peninsular
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed dramatically from what he said last year at the UN General Assembly when he announced that North Korea’s missile deployment to the continental United States is inevitable after the “Left President’s Army” fired at Mr. Trump.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps in the direction of disarmament, but stressed that there was still much to be done, and the sanctions must be lifted until the ceasefire is lifted.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it does not matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what has been done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue energetically, without allowing mistakes, until a final and convincing denunciation has been achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an effort to achieve the depletion of funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly, and then informed that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not a success.
He went away from Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but it was only a few hours later that North Korea accused him of "gangster's worthy demands".
North Korea's meeting with Munu this month pledged to dismantle the weapons range and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University will learn the subject of how to get enough rest
The new subject of study at Harvard University this year has made students sleep more, and it is an attempt to turn to an increasingly popular culture of brutality that includes caffeine-filled study through the night.
Some professors have found that the best university students in the world often do not even have a clue about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital) specialist developed the subject of study, which, he believes, is the first type of teaching in the U.S.
The inspiration for the creation of a new subject of study for him arose after his speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of a girl came to me and asked, 'Why tell me that only now when I'm in the last course?'
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep is — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the free subject of study, provides students with basic information about how good sleep habits promote achievements in training and sports, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university’s health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the study week.
The long-term training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of the housing doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and how important sleep is.
In another section, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," added Professor <0xC4><0x8C>aislers.
He said that the culture in which he is proud of the ability to study all night still exists, and added that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep switches the brain to hunger mode, making it constantly exasperating.
Reimmonds So (Raymond So), a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop an object of study after taking part in one of the professor’s lessons last year, Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of the study has opened his eyes and was inspired to achieve so that the course would be available to the whole student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who gain a postgraduate education to master a similar program before going on to enjoy the competition.
Professor <0xC4><0x8C>aislers advises students to install an alarm not only at the time when they will wake up, but also when they will go to bed, as well as to keep in mind how people are affected by the "blue light" caused by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, because they can interfere with the daytime running.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Mengas gate bypasses Gerarda's men
"Rangers" was visited by another sad game of guests when Dollie Mengas (Dolly Menga) hit Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's confused team decision 1 - 0 loss against "Livingston".
The Ibrox team had been hoping to win their first trip since the 4:1 victory of St Johnstone in February, but Gerry Holt's team provided Gerard with his second loss in 18 games since he became the club's manager, and his team is in 8 points of the game.
Menga started the ball in the gate seven minutes before the end of the half-hour, and the lack of inspiration from "Rangers" did not look at anything after an attempt to equalize the result.
"Rangers" falls to sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to third, and the gate difference is surpassed by only "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" can come up with another problem, because the assistant judge Kalum Spence needed medical help due to head trauma, apparently caused by the distant end of the city object.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind "Ayr", reaching the "Betfred" cup semi-final.
In turn, Holts used the same Livingston 11 players, who took one point from Hearts the previous week, and he would be happy as his well-trained team pressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that "Rangers" more often managed the ball, but "Livingston" better used what was their action.
They were supposed to get the gates already two minutes after the start of Meng's first game sent Scott Pittman to the gates of Alan McGregor, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then the free kick of K<0xC4><0xAB>gan Jakob (Keaghan Jacobs) reached Captain Kraig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to throw the ball only far past the rear pole.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the play in the last third is expected, not believed that it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly believed that he should have taken a penalty kick in the 15th minute after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the lawsuit.
"Rangers" scored only two goals in the first half, but the former "Ibrox" goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not interfere in any particular way, nor did Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibaly) hit him with his head, not a decent Ovi Ed<0xC5><0xBE>aria (Ovie Ejaruma).
Although the 34th minute of Livingston may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" didn't end up with Jacobs' planned combination of spirit again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
During Gerard's break, Kulibali was replaced by Raein Kent (Ryan Kent), and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately blocked the year.
However, Livingston continued to let the guests play as they like, with Lithuania and Halket making one long hit after another.
Holt's team would have been able to continue the lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping James before Litgow made a head-to-head shot from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, asked for another penalty kick in the late game, after a collision with Jacobs, but Tomson's request was ignored again.
Almanahs: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm "Hanss" Geigers, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result, at the end of the day, there was a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has taken its place in science and preserved its place in pop culture, has also taken its place, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which the main roles were played externally unconvincingly by the type of cowboy: the scientist E. Rovans.
Man: "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you will be able to hear how the atoms that emit these minerals work because of the radioactivity they produce."
Evans: "Really, it's really a bird!"
"Hanss" Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, named for him, continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them
Within the framework of vaccine therapy, the immune system is taught to recognize malignant cells
Using this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
Then they will be able to "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows multi-drug results in patients with a variety of types of malignant tumours.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining from the patient's immune system cells, transforming them into a laboratory so that they can "see" several tumour-like proteins HER2, and then inject these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) in Bethesda, Maryland, reported Professor Jay Berzofsky: “Our results show that we have a very multi-solvable vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes several types of malignant tumour growth," including breast, ovary, lung, and colon cancer in the large and straight intestine, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, when the patient acquires immune cells, to which "learned" how to attack malignant tumour cells, has taken effect in the case of one type of leukemia.
Kanje Vests after staying in SNL, dressed in MAGA hat, attacked Trump's critics.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was cast in the Saturday Night Live studio during an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After finishing the third song yesterday, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore "Make America Great" hats, he began to sniff out loud phrases about Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
Well, if I was interested in racism, then it would have been a long time since I left America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate Judiciary Committee's charge of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock (Chris Rock).
It is not clear whether Roks was trying to wipe the West like this.
And yet the West commended the spectators for having been ill-treated by him in the rear of his skull.
"They kicked me in the back!
They said, "Don't get out there with that hat on your head!"
They kicked me out!
And yet they said that I've lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Vests went on: "Gribat see what happens when you lose connection with reality?", and promised to pull up "your Superman hostage", because it means that you can't tell me what to do with me. Want the world to move forward?
“Try to love!”
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience whistles at least twice, but the members of the show's team looked shocked, and at least one person told the press release: "There was complete silence in the studio."
The bride was last invited to replace the singer Arianna Grande, who had been killed a few days ago by a friend of rapper Max Miller (Mac Miller).
The vest mixed many with the song (I Love it), which he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Wes was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandance Turner, whose Twitter account read: "To one of the strongest people in the world: THANK YOU, WHO WERE NOT HAPPENED!"
But the head of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that Vests simply "was who he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to pay for a person (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, supports and feeds an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before this show's rapper on Twitter announced that he has changed his name, saying that he has now become "a being previously known as Kanji Vest".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the villainous music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "a stage artist formerly known as Prince".

Complaints will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kits Heringtons turns to toxic manhood
Kits Heringtons is known as the sword-cancerous John Snow on HBO's evil medieval fantasy series "Tron Games".
But the 31-year-old actor has turned to the stereotype of a brutal hero, pointing out that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thought there was a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kits, who recently met with his partner Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years old, acknowledged that this problem is important to him.
"I can't even think right now about what kind of mistakes we've made with manhood," he said.
"What do we young men learn in this aspect of the problem as they grow up taking into account the existing problem?"
Mr Kits believes that television, with its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood.
He continued, "Who is born, but who is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be such to be perceived as men?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are obviously problems with young men." . . .
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any "Game of Thrones" sequel or trailer, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are exhausted".
Starting with November, Kits will play the lead role in the renewed Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother a thief.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rosa to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife on this show because it in its own way ensured my family and my life from that moment," he said.
The Pink Emmy Award-winning fantasy series was played by Other character John Snow's beloved Igrit.
The couple broke up in June 2018 under the ownership of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has said that its citizens living with HIV and AIDS have increased rapidly by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which indicates changes.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials were briefed at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission as a result of sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is often found.
Taking into account the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually appreciate women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are not sufficiently protected by the result of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been committed to the general availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Voters has denied that the employee leaked the data of Republican senators, turned to "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives (Maxine Waters) rejected claims that its staff member has published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia's lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims are spread by the "ultra-right" wing of the news and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more innocent lies," Voters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the leaked information includes the address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a hearing in the Senate panel on Brett Caveno’s allegations of sexual misconduct in the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators had sacked Caveno.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, have reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the record is linked to the office of Voters, and have disclosed information about Voters personnel, Hills said.
"This baseless statement is absolutely untrue and totally false!" stated Voters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of this fraudulent and untrue claim, is not in any way responsible for the leak of information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely untrue and completely false.’
Voters' statement soon sparked criticism online, including criticism of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is an angry ban," Fleischer wrote.
"It makes it possible to conclude that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person must not be angry.
He can't be a soldier.
He must not express his views on the grounds of the complainant.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer's task was to compare Voters' reaction to the Democratic fall of Judge Caveno, who accused him of overreacting during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to get Voters to lose the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
In its statement, Voters informed that her cabinet had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all of their work that is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review — half-heartedly left Rowan Atkinson's parody of spy movies
It has become common to look for an association with Brexit in every new film with a British trailer, and this seems to also apply to the one that has resurfaced, the Johnny English adventure comedy franchise that re-launched in 2003 and re-launched in 2003 with Angie's "D."
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation to be satisfactorily cleaned of ourselves, of how obviously hopeless we are?
In any case, incompetent Johnny Anglim with his eyes peeled and unusually moving face has the right to create a scar after the second resurgence — his name signals more than any other that he is a wide-spectrum comical character who has been cast in the wild, who has not been created.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to adoring refinement, is a bit of a clown, a little bit of a Mr. Bean, and a dashing guy who plays one night in the theme of "Chariots of Fire" in the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based on the traveler and international, incomprehensible character Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos in his own way.
In the latest Johnny English adventure, there are at least one or two good moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Angle goes on a helicopter wearing a medieval armor suit, and the propeller blades for a while seem against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is well visible, but the humor is quite weak and strangely superficial, especially because the "serious" movie brand like "007" and "Impossible Mission" itself confidently uses the comedy alone as a comedy.
Humor makes the impression that it is more dedicated to children, not adults, and I think Johnny English’s absurd remains are not as creative and targeted as the tricks of the Atkinson Mom film in Bina’s skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that the UK has fallen into a serious trap.
Cyberhacker has infiltrated the UK’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of UK agents in all of this area, as an unwelcome active agent — the unfortunate role of little Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pompous and the conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing what she can, with Teréza Mei in part, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her advisers in the field of intelligence inform that, since all the active spikes have been detected, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the inexperienced Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher at a fine educational institution, and teaches the subjects how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes) because Anglis offers to master the punctuation profession from the very foundations.
Angles is brought back to Vaithulo's extraordinary meeting and is reunited with his former long-suffering assistant Bo, also played this time by Ben Miller.
For now, a married man, married to an underwater commander, is a fun character who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine has not been fully used.
And so Batman and Robin make a huge mistake in serving in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back and meets the beautiful lucky woman Ophelia Lodi (Ophelia Bulletova) pictured by Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko).
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously haunted by the charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Volta, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the UK's computer chain.
Angles and Bo begin their wild odyssey of fun: disguised as officers, they light up a fine French restaurant; they create a mix of secrets by diving into the Volts luxury yacht; and Angles causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual space on the Volts main deck.
Everything is made possible for the end of the dance, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has a lot of children's television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party rejects plans for Britain to work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but the salary will be five.
It is reported that the party wants corporate leaders, with the help of the artificial intelligence revolution, to allocate to the workers the saved, to give them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day long weekend while receiving the same high salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the agenda of the party in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the good of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that changes in policy will be announced by the end of this year.
"This will not happen in one day, but four days of work week is an idea that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in the industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce four working weeks already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as it is now does not support these hungers.
The Labour Party representative said: "The four-day working week does not fall within the party policy and the party does not consider it."
House Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give a boost to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Makdonela explained that he has committed to take back the power of the "mass of directors" and of the "speculants" of the public service companies.
The intention of the Minister of Housing also means that the existing average shareholders in the water companies may not recover their entire package, as the Leiborist government could implement the "rebate" due to the injustices allowed.
He also approved plans to include working companies in the boards of directors and establish exclusive Property Rights Funds (Ownership Funds) to allocate 10% of private sector company capital to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes", or FIB investigation in Kaveno case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the office could be left to a Republican senator to dismiss.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" broadcast correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FIB could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left a more open impression of a man than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, referring to the hearing procedure, I said that I spoke with Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the accusation became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, Grema’s vote is obviously carved into stone.
"We've made a decision on Brett Caven, and we're going to need a gruesome indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know, look what: Brett deliberately denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her name was able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive number of stars and has an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Central Park in the Great Moor, not only to enjoy performances such as the Janet Jacksons, the rappers Cardi B (Cardi B), and Sean Mensa (also known as Sean Mensa).
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer job, sending an e-mail to a world leader, sending a message, sending a message to a world leader, sending it
But how successful has the movement "Global Citizen" been, whose goal is to achieve another 12 years?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people seem to be really able to influence what by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, in an effort to achieve various goals.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to report on commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds allocated so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and executives established in the UK, committed to "help children grow to the full", vowing to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help save the world after spending more than $400 on Twitter.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave incomplete nutrition in the history of social injustice," said Treisy Ulmena (The Power of Nutrition) representative at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5000 measures were launched, by inviting the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced the funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – “What makes you think we can end ultimate poverty?”
Global Citizen commented: "This will be a long and long way in which we will at times fall asleep and suffer failure.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before us, we will also be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson (Janet Jackson), the Weeknd, Sean Mendes (Shawn Mendes), Cardi B, Jeanella Mon<0xC3><0xA8>e (Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e) are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness).
U.S. could use military fleets for "blockage" to stop Russian energy exports, says Interior Minister
"In case of necessity" Washington can use its military fleet to prevent Russia's energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said US Interior Minister Raiens Zinke (Ryan Zinke), as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, particularly in places where it operates under the legitimate government’s call, are an asset for the study of new energy markets.
“I think the reason it’s in the Middle East is because it wants to deliver energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can take care that the sea lanes are open, as well as, if necessary, to block them, so that Russia can not put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the audience who had come to attend the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization calling itself the "energy consumer voice" of the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation of Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option between Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy relies mainly on fossil fuels alone.
There are enough claims that the Trump administration promotes the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with many of the cheapest options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and also U.S. President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that would make Berlin "independent" of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s project of inflammable opposition is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agreed that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandar said after a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Riku Periyu.
The United States has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial sector organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), Dieter Kempfs.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she is seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During the hearing in Holio, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that she was considering running for president.
"There is a right time for Washington to have women who will 'yellow' the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president of the United States."
During the court hearing, Warren recalled President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply troubled by what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Vorena has openly criticized Trump and his elected Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Vorena said, "Of course, an FIB investigation is needed before the elections."
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was revealed that a majority of Voronezh’s supporters do not believe that she should run for the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe Center for Political Research/Journal of Suffolk University, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts voters said that senators should not run for election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey revealed that the former governor, Devals Patriks, had obtained greater support, receiving 38 percent for the election and 48 percent against.
In connection with the possible nomination for the 2020 election, the high-profile words of Democratic Party workers such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator B<0xC3><0xA4>rnijs Sanders will appear.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed that Baiden has committed to make an official decision by January.
Sarah Peilin in the novel by Treka Peilin in the novel by Donald Trump
Treks Peilins (26) spent years in Iraq after being drafted into the war effort in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with rape in the family.
"What my own son is going through, which he is going through after his return, I can relate to other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain amount of vulnerability, with which our soldiers are returning," she told the public in the wake of Donald Trump.
Peilina called his arrest an "obvious problem that we can't see everywhere" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back stuck, they go back to the battlefield, they go back to the battlefield, they come back again, they think
According to police department representative Dena Beneta, he was arrested on Monday in Vasilia, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women and the possession of weapons while in a state of captivity.
18 states, Colombia region met the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian region support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that provides shelter to victims fleeing gangs or violence in the family.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington on Friday presented a brief statement to the court adviser in support of asylum seekers who have faced the obstacles posed by the said policy, reports NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and her violent gang mate's son" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her plea for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grees described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large part of which comes from U.S. asylum-seekers, as countries where the problem of gangs and violence in the family is widespread.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing the violence family to seek asylum.
Colombia’s Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignore the state, federal and international laws imposed on the decadent.”
"Federal law provides that all asylum requests are examined in the light of the facts and circumstances of the relevant claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court counsel said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that causes immigrants to enter the country harms the U.S. economy, as these immigrants would most likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions turned to immigration judges asking them not to grant asylum to victims who fled the violence in the family and gangs for acts of ill-treatment.
"Respect is available to persons who abandon their homeland because of the persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political views," Sessions said in a June 11 statement on politics.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Efforts to rescue Palu by doubling the number of casualties in the search for survivors
The situation of the survivors has become more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old R<0xC4><0xAB>za Kusuma, calming her brown-haired baby in the evacuation center of the city of P<0xC4><0x81>lu.
"In just a few minutes, the emergency medical service is introducing new victims.
Clean water is deficient."
The inhabitants were visible, returning to their destroyed homes and crossing the water-scattered estates, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which had suffered from a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had a broken back and shoulder, were lying outside the Pal Army Hospital, where patients were cared for outside due to the severe afternoon.
His eyes narrowed, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the number of the hotel on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I seem to have been pushed against the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, claiming that his family had arrived in the city for the purpose of the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Inciting Attempts Using Propaganda Ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came up with a four-page long advertisement, highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an annex paid by the China Daily in the state-owned Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, but China denies it.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told the Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of a growing trade war, as a result of which they apply a series of tariffs on each other’s imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s repressive tariffs were aimed at exporters in states such as Aiova, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terri Branstads, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on Sunday's issue of the Des Moines Register, claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses in its favor the tradition of freedom of speech and free press for America by placing a paid advertisement "Des Moines Register," Branstads wrote.
"On the other hand, here in the ordinary Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited amount of different opinions and you will not see such a different opinion in a real reflection, which the Chinese people may have in connection with the disturbing economic trajectory of China, according to the
He noted that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn about Republicans cheering women’s turnout from mid-term elections, which involve the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the upcoming mid-term elections, they will not be able to live happily ever after.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that the majority of Republicans were already ready to give up their vote.
Such things cannot be withdrawn, "in that Saturday's article in the newspaper "The Hill" was announced by Professor Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maksvela School of Science.
R<0xC3><0xBC>hrer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s recent call to conduct the FIB investigation will be a pretty big reason to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser of the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" on the Senate floor, when the Republicans, under the direction of the Judicial Committee, chose to continue the candidacy of Kaveno in spite of Dr. Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Bleisija Ford (Dr. Christine Blasei<0xC4><0x87>, Dr. Blasie<0xC4><0x87>)
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst St. Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say that it's already at a high level, that's the truth.
But it could be even higher, especially among the city's vibrant swing voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29) who often don't go to the polls even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she made allegations of sexual violence on the part of the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts said it was a possible failure if Republicans continued to push for this candidacy.
"This has become a gradual chaos for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be tried, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they've stood up against it," said Guy Cecil in a news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are a little divided on who to believe according to the testimony of Ford and Caveno, a little more in the blink of an eye to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Caven’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said Caveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleika's prompting, FIB is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno, at the age of 17, had committed a sexual assault against him.
Ramirez claims that during her studies as a candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge, Jeila has shown her her genetics at a party in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web developer, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the first-order platform "Solid" opened in B<0xC4><0x93>rners-L<0xC4><0xAB>.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's secret intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses "Solid" technology so that people can build their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available simultaneously in a single browser.
The storage of personal online data is unique in that only the user determines what and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers through the use of data".
According to company manager John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make "Solid" available to everyone.
The company is currently operating in B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-L<0xC4><0xAB>, Br<0xC3><0xB8>ss, IBM acquired a security platform, some external developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
B<0xC4><0x83>rnerss-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with Facebook and Google about whether to introduce complete changes, completely bypassing all of their business models in one night.
"We're not asking for his permission."
In an article published Saturday by the platform "Medium" B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-Lee said that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on "Solid".
In 1994, B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-Lee transformed the Internet into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by establishing a Global Web Consortium.
In recent months, B<0xC4><0x93>rnersam-L<0xC4><0xAB> has had an influential opinion in the discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-L<0xC4><0xAB> will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Marking of the Victoria Cross awarded to a priest during World War I
For 100 years now, the city of its birth has been celebrating an event when the only guardian of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter.
This award was received by the Honourable Lieutenant Bernard Vens on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaukort.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
On Saturday's show in Northamptonshire, Northamptonshire, his two toddlers opened a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his minions, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "extremely symbolic", that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and large-scale and heavy-handed large fires."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and with the utmost confidence led this line forward before taking up the large-area zone, where he won three groupings.
The German sniper was killed by a gunman on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vence, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I could never do, and which at the same time is also a very humble act".
He, along with his brother Dr. James Vann, was also in debt to the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens said that he was "congratulating himself on participating in this debt" and noted that "the value of the true hero is evidenced by the support provided by many people".
MMA fans were waiting for Bellator 206 all night long, but instead they were waiting for C<0xC5><0xAB>cin<0xC4><0xAB> Pepu
Imagine that spent up all night to see the Bellator 206, but in the end you are prevented from watching this main event.
13 battles were included in the Sanhose poster, including the six main maps, which were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6.00 a.m., when Gegards Musasi (Gegard Mousasi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were pleasantly surprised by the change of transmission to C<0xC5><0xAB>cin<0xC4><0x97> Pepu.
Some were in a real misunderstanding, when all night until the early morning had remained dormant, waiting for a fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 a.m. this kind of content is not acceptable, so there was a switchover to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication.
"Puppy Pepa," "Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would work on a schedule so that viewers in the UK can see these broadcasts in the future.
"Thinking about re-transmission, I think we'll be able to sort it out," said Kokers.
"But the clock there is six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of text appeared after the switch, and they were not positive.
We tried to stop it because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problem.
We will stick to five fights, not six (as it has been so far). We try to please the fans, but let’s move on.
It is an unsuccessful situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Delilah did not feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic snitch Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
While attending the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", directed by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about gay rights to give others "a chance".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term program, has been given several months of rest due to illness.
Appearing as expelled from society in Laverne's first program, Delilah said that growing up to feel "less valuable" than others, because "in society it is not accepted that both girls and boys can be liked".
He said: "Until today, the feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main trigger that gave me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there is "something" to keep people from hoping when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic Games bronze medalist has become the head of a high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year’s Friendship Games in Australia, calling on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "the hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised the unprepared".
Dahl was awarded the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, and claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
“When you’ve gone through so much at such a young age” (his first Olympic Games were 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Delilah claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that mattered to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Delilah said that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Delilah was about whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she's not going to be in the front row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand until the moment he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, he took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — getting in front of the housekeepers at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song, "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to achieving the Olympic Games and still riding a horse.
The program "Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. after British summer time.
Michaelson's Reservist Step Out of Shape at Saturday's Raider Cup Play
American Phil Mickelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup game match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turnaround.
Michaelson, who is already participating in the championship for the 12th time every two years, captain Jim Furyk placed on the reserve step on Saturday for four ball games and two pairs of games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has so often been in connection with the US teams, the fifth winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game in the hope of fixing what is bothering him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the brunt of the fight "Le Golf National" in the uneven field, where inaccurate bats are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Michaelson will fight the exact British Open Championship winner Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molinari (Francesco Molinari), who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fletwood (Tommy Fleletwood), in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans who are left with four points, starting with 12 single-player matches, successfully take the lead, the Michaelsons could play a decisive role.
Furiks without words expressed confidence in the members of their team.
"He was fully aware of his role today, he pushed me on my back, he applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furiks said.
"He's very confident about himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and also this week.
I don't think I could have imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagine more, but everything has changed as it has changed, and that is what we are going to take into account.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson sets a record for Nick Faldo's most-played matches in the Raiders Cup race on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Raider Cup race career, which has never really been hidden from the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has won 18 wins, experienced 20 losses and seven undecided games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic and a bit witty, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great team member," he explained.
"I think the youngest players also liked to tease him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that in the management of a significant turnout, one can quickly get away with it.
European selection captain Thomas Bjorns knows from experience that a crucial step in the management of the Raider Cup in the final days of the singles game can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis made his debut at the 1997 Valderram Games, where a team of opponents, captained by Sive Baljesteros (Seve Ballesteros), won a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small lead, 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84> to win by 14.2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a significant lead in Valderram; we had a lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a small margin," said Bjorns (pictured) in the lead-up to the 5th edition of the 2018 edition.
Thus, history will show to me and to every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will return everything to yourself.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will also focus on it.
I have always said that I focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very well aware of what is coming against us on the other side – the most outstanding players in the world."
Facilitated by the performance shown by his players in the golf course, Bjorns remarked: "I never complained about agru.
Tomorrow there are new challenges.
Tomorrow is scheduled for individual games, and that is a completely different thing.
It is great if at times, when everything is going well, you have a partner next to you, but in individual games your golfer skills are fully tested.
This message you have to pass on to your players, that is, to them in the next day's game to give themselves back everything.
Now you are leaving your partner, and he too must be able to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents team captain Jim Furicks will be keen to show his players his best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Spieth (Justin Thomas), who scored.
Furiks himself has been on both sides of these important last-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later suffering a break-up when the European teams got a sensational success, which later became known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, combined his players for the final day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to immediately get into the fast track that you experienced in Brooklyn, that you experienced in Medina.
When such a pulse is emitted in one direction, it creates a great deal of pressure in relation to mid-season games.
We created our own composition accordingly and arranged the guys in the way we felt right. We will try to do some magic tomorrow."
Tomas was given the task of trying to lead the counter-insurgency, and he led Rory McIlroy to the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram (Jon Rahm), and Tommy Fleytvu.
"I put the guys in that order because, in my opinion, it's the best fit in the course of the tournament," Bjorns said of the selected single-players.
The transfer of the new German warship to operation has been postponed again
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen at least until next year due to the faulty system and rising costs, local medier reported.
The transfer of the main ship of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class "Rheinland-Pfalz" into service has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, it reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing a representative of the military field.
The ship was expected to join the fleet in 2014, but unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ordered by the Karaflote in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful large area, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal perception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods — the possibility of placing new frigates up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate their power in the overseas countries, will already be obsolete by the time it enters service, notes Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 last year was mined in all headlines when the German car fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and sent it back to the shipbuilding company "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the karaflote had returned to the shipbuilding facility after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for such a move, but the German media mentioned several significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warships useless if used on a combat mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships operate around 120 large crews, which are only half of the personnel of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also shown that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to make its improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
The cost of the entire project (including crew training) has also become a major problem in the same way as the faulty equipment.
It says that its costs reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important, given the recent warnings that the German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the car fleet was indeed "beginning to miss the ship to be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly reduced, as old ships are taken out of service, but new ones are not delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates had joined the fleet.
"National Trust" will listen to the lives of the secret gangsters
A new study, which is being conducted in a Scottish Highlands property, is aimed at discovering how hedgehogs in the process of searching for food use the landscape.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help them in future protective measures.
Scientists from the Scottish National Trust in the gardens of Inververe in Vesteros will study pruned worms, pigme worms, as well as brown longhorns and water nightworms.
In the main places, special entrants will be placed in the property, which will follow the activities of the bandmates throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of band calls and which species are performing the specific actions.
A biotope map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view reflecting the behaviour of the bandwagon.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for vertebrates and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits provided by the management work of biotopes such as the creation of meadows, and how best to preserve the forest band and other related species.
During the last hundred years, the population of the sexes in Scotland and the United Kingdom has deteriorated considerably.
These lands are threatened by construction and development work, which affects the loss of the hiding place and the place of residence of the gangsters.
Also, wind generators and lighting can pose a risk, as can fly paper and some building materials chemical treatments, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, the bracelets are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears during hunting are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated support-location method to identify insects and obstacles in the trajectory of their flight to find them.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the problem of hedgehogs.
Ten trained experts are at the disposal of the organisation, who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups of the interlocutory vaults and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even established in Scotland the first and the only specially-designed "Threave" reserve in Damfris and Galove, where eight of the ten species of herring found in Scotland are minted.
The property manager, David Thompson, claims that this area is ideally suited for the hip hop pairings.
"Here's a great place for bracelets," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and in general a suitable biotop.
But there are still a lot of things that we don’t know about hippies, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
He stresses that before carrying out the maintenance work of the property, it is important to check whether there are no ropes in the relevant place, since it may be assumed that up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed, thus populating the possibility of the disappearance of one of the mother's hiding places.
The hens are protected animals and must not be killed, bitten, disturbed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust (Scotland) has called on the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about herring, and for many species we just don't know how to coat them."
Ronaldo refuses to file a complaint by appointing lawyers to sue the German magazine in court
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned him in the prosecution as "bad news", claiming that people "want to pay attention" to him using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The Portuguese-born and Turin-born "Juventus" football star is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid a woman $375,000 to silence her about the incident, it was reported on Friday by Der Spiegel.
A few hours after the statement was made, Ronald, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers via Instagram online, calling this information "bad news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or award winner told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it is part of my work.
I'm a lucky man, and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel magazine for the allegations they have made about "unacceptable disclosure of suspicious fundamentals in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent that it corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino "suite" class in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada, it is reported that after meeting at the nightclubs of Ronald and Majorga, the player returned to the hotel number, where he sexually assaulted a woman.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on the road and said that he was "about 99 percent "good guy", but fell in this "one percent" campaign.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened after a bilateral agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and photos of the trauma she had received at the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wishes to agree to the terms of this agreement, as the incident left a lasting trauma.
At the time of these statements, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this year for 100 million euros he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexit: UK's loss of carmakers 'unfortunately regrettable'
"The United Kingdom will 'sad forever' if, after Brexit, it loses its position as world leader in the production of cars," said Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
They are "disturbed" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production near the Burnaston plant in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said that a delay on the border in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could put the game in the workplace.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been concerned about leaving the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, "BMW" claims that after Brexit it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month.
According to the authors, the main concerns are about the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "stunning in time", where cars made on order receive parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border that could lead to some delays and abstentions.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not be able to hold more than one day worth of inventory at its Cherubishi factory, so would have to stop production.
Mr Klark said that the exit plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "exactly calculated to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I said, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indication of this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota's inability to say how long production could be halted, but warned that the long-term increase in costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsuvallaris (Peter Tsuvallaris), who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as a union merger coordinator, said that his members are feeling increasingly anxious: "From experience, I can say that as soon as a post disappears, it does not return."
The government representative said: "We have submitted a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, reports White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "suspended for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Caveno's candidacy continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference of Russia's will, the link between Trump's funds and Russia, as well as possible non-compliance with the law on the part of the president.
For months now, there has been a debate in Washington about whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed signing up with Trump and the possibility of leaving the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where he made fun of the talk of his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump, who was present at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time.
Trump said he "preferred" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which witnessed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing a sexual assault — Dr. Forge.
On Friday, Trump asked the FIB to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations made by Caveno, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders (Sarah Sanders), visited Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be a week or a week later, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
The manager, Kriss Vallas (Chris Wallace), asked why.
Sanders said the lack of freedom has nothing to do with a dislike of the "famous cards" of television reporters, although she added: "I don't deny the fact that they are the famous cards."
After that, she proposed direct contact between Trump, as a result of which the interest of the press will increase.
"The president engages in more questions and answers in sessions than any president before him," she said, noting, without providing more detailed information, "We are interested in the number of them."
Sanders said that the holidays will still take place, but, "if the press will have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions indiscriminately, it is indisputably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this, and you see we've done a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to be a press release at the place where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps, the president demonstrated its reason for this week in New York, accusing the reporter of an uncontrollable and sometimes strange expression of effort.
Health Minister writes to EU staff Scotland's NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish for the resilience after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman (MSP) sent a letter less than six months prior to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fr<0xC3><0xBC>hmen wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal, which led to the decisions expected this autumn, continued.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very difficult time for you.
Therefore, I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and provide benefits to our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Kristjen Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation
In Tennessee state "Tigers" for the defense of Kristen Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) was performed an emergency operation after a head injury, which he obtained in a Saturday game, in which with a result of 31-27 climbs "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported "Tennesssean Mai sport"
In Tennessee, the head coach of the state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was received shortly before half-time.
"He came to the side of the line and said it collapsed," said Reid.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the trainer and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put on a stretcher and escorted him to further investigation.
A state official in Tennessee told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had been isopered at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is currently no information on the type/weight of the trauma", and the Tennessee state team is trying to figure out at what point this trauma is obtained.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after replacing Ilonis against the Tennessee state team.
Before leaving Saturday's game, he had made five blocks in total, which in this season totaled 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the accessories obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralize Corbin’s efforts to attract new voters.
The increased state fee will be applicable to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national case states that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million can be collected annually, which can be diverted to provide assistance to homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national tax rate by buying property in the United Kingdom and by diverting the proceeds to provide assistance to homeless people, it will be announced today by the Mayor of Teréza Meja.
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters with pledges to provide housing at more favourable prices and by talking about the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state fee will be applicable to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money raised to allow government efforts to tackle the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level levy introduced two years ago for the purchase and purchase of a second home for the purpose of leasing, could be as much as three per cent.
The national case provides that such a step may supplement its budget by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents, thus imposing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their homes.
Many rich national territories, especially in the capital, have become "spacious cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state tax so that more young people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by digging up the land, but without using it, and urged Mrs. Mejas to give up the quotas in respect of the price-acceptable housing to deal with the UK.
Mr Korbina has proposed a number of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on rent control and removal from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new housing.
Mrs Mejas said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream - that is, every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means arranging the market for our beloved homes.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not true that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK, so hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of their home has become too far away, and the problem of the homeless is still topical."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is at some point to become the leader of Scotland.
Scott, 42, has taken on the challenge of restoring the Northeast club, which currently takes third place in the first league with three points from above.
This year he moved to the Stadium of Light after the St Mirren re-entered Scotland's premi<0xC3><0xA8>re last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B cup, and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC's Sportssound broadcast.
"But I grew up with my father watching the game "Scotland" in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity will only appear if I would be successful in leading the club."
Rosa's leaders at Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moijes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Poijets, and Guss Poijets.
The former chairman of Alloa Athletic says that he has not felt any anxiety following the footsteps of such a large club of recognised managers, rejecting the offers previously made by Barnslijk and Ipswich.
"My success will now be assessed as to whether I will be able to return this club to its premi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
It is because of the structure and possibilities of this club that it is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"To return to the club premi<0xC3><0xA8>re will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will be here successful only when this task is completed."
Ross is only in his third year as a manager, previously serving as a deputy director in Dumbarton and spending 15 months as a Hearts coach.
After that, he helped the club "Alloa" recover from falling to the third level and in the same season "St Mirren" helped to win the title of champion.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than during his player's career at clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"They may have been true crusades," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa".
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling — a lot more appropriate than playing.
It sounds familiar, because I have had good success, I was able to live and enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it. It seems that I’m in the right place, I haven’t felt so good all my life.”

The survey found that the best time to enjoy a pint is at 17.30 on Saturday afternoon.
The summer heat wave has allowed the UK’s less popular pubs to settle, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The collected data revealed that sales of bars and pubs had increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consultancy agency CGA, which collected data, said: "Incessantly sunny weather and England's long participation in the World Cup race meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, the fall of June, the fall of the
Restaurants, whose competition decreased by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even more difficult situation in July.
The situation in the pubs and bars was the most pleasant, as they experienced a much bigger uphill than restaurants experienced downhill.
Even food-based hooks suffer from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant staff felt.
It turns out that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The consumption of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the consumption of food decreased by 3 per cent.
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend that is observed at the end of April.
Timescales and the impact of a wide range of social or sporting events are the biggest factors that determine turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although the drop in sales by 4.8% compared to the previous year’s period will be particularly painful for additional incessant cost pressures.
With regard to food suppliers in the spirit and in the hot summer could not come at the most inappropriate time, and time will show whether a moderate temperature, which we usually experience in August, will provide such a much-needed shelter."
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the UK’s sales watchdog for bars, pubs and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from its 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is the industry’s benchmark.
Every fifth child has a hidden social media account, which it hides from its parents.
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a hidden social media account, which they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, which involved 20,000 high school students, revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show to their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, forms social media accounts, which they hide from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, it was found that the number of fake profiles on Instagram is growing rapidly on the photo-sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clean main" account, which they show to their parents, and also have private accounts.
A mother, who is on the run for her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eil<0xC4><0xAB>da Doila will be the "lightest voice" on the Scottish Board of Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors of Eilidh Doyle, he was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as Director without executive powers.
Doila is Scotland’s most award-winning space and outdoor lightweight, and President Ian Beattie has described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at an international level in the coming years.
"The elites are given a great deal of respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world in the light-hearted community, and we are confident that the Scottish light-hearted will gain tremendous amounts by participating in their government," B<0xC4><0xAB>tijs said.
Doila said: "I want to act as a "simplified voice" and I hope that I can really get involved and help move this kind of sport in Scotland."

He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't afford it.
The doctors said that only time will tell if and how much I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I completely recovered, re-learned to walk and I can already do exercise today!
Thank you for the inspirational words!”
Opinions shared on breast milk pump advertising, which compares mother to cow
The breast milk pump production company has taken care of the shared views online in connection with the advertising, in which the feeding mothers are compared to the feeding of cows.
To mark the release of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump" into circulation, consumer technology company "Elvie" releases a sticky message advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that a breast-feeding mother gives a new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance with a wall-filled cow in a cow at a song whose words sound like this: "Yes, I'll spit myself out, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not ghosts, they're my breasts".
In the parable, he goes on: "Send, send, I feed the little ones, send, send, I send my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has evoked a wide range of resonances online.
The video, viewed 77 000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received mixed reviews from viewers, and many argue that it highlights in the light of the milk industry's "shocks".
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they, too, have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they are born," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively fits into the breast of breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast milk pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The opinion was also echoed: "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the advertisement, and some woman admitted that, in her opinion, the song was "exciting".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I would buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Milk withdrawal made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun ad meant for moms who take off milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like a "goat".
It is not an advertisement that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovers that she was all dancing with unscrupulous pumps placed on her breasts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who withdraw milk claim that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely silent, it does not have wires and pipes, and it is inadvertently included in the breast for pregnant women, allowing them to move freely, hold babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Ana Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: ""Elvie Pump" pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a bold and provocative release on the market.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and milking cows, we wanted to focus on milking, while demonstrating in an amusing and understandable way the overwhelming sense of freedom that the new pump will carry."
It is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come into the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared in the language of Martha Jakubowski on the screen using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent town near the Texas border to remain silent
The number of detained migrant children has grown rapidly, although the border is crossed by relatively as many people every month as before, and in part by the rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to accommodate children at the sponsor.
Usually, the majority of sponsors were also undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that, openly applying to take up a child, it would jeopardise their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other immigration-related institutions.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior immigration and customs law enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for sponsorships of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously convicted.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or house-sponsors are staying here illegally, and a large part of these people are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute such people," Mr Albens said.
According to the asylum seeker, in an effort to expedite the examination of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules, which provide that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of their detention and not 60 days after their arrest, as the norm had originally predicted.
Many will use the videoconference call option rather than come in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
The persons who will be considered unfit for the purpose of obtaining the exemption will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children are held in detention, the greater the likelihood that they will become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, has been reported according to information provided by the asylum-seekers and testimony received during the last month.
Advocates argued that these concerns will increase in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering, are more often overlooked because of their breadth.
They added that moving children to the tent city, not spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to give up on friends, could create traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria prompts U.S., French and Turkish "occupying armies" to withdraw their forces immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for almost eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syria to defend the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "which against terrorism has almost ended".
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleared of both terrorist groups and "the presence of any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions had been great for them to return, and punished the "separate Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears", as refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the restoration of the country before an agreement on the end of the war between Assad and the opposition is concluded.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the basis of the last dumpsters in Idlib has created an opportunity to intensify political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal "is definitely on time", and expressed hope that military action will be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked group Jabhat al-Nusrah, which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Stafans de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura) hopes to convene the first meeting of the new committees, comprising representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualems outlined the conditions for the Syrian State's participation in the Committee, stressing that the group's work would be limited to "review of the existing Constitution's articles", and warned of interference.
Why Tramps will be chosen for a second term
From this point of view, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election, unless, and on top of that, perhaps, many liberal observers, impeachment and scandal will prematurely fail to make a point for his presidency.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic presidential final of all time!"
At the moment, there is no evidence of the observer's reluctance.
Since 2014, the ratings have more than doubled in the most profitable CNN broadcast, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.

She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he's harassing me,'" said Skovela's cousin.
Chaos is, to some extent, amusing.
Of course, unlike all the rest that can be seen on TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen with the judgment of Rou v. Vieid, whether the immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.

He was unable to stand, even when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future at the Supreme Court was threatened with fraud.
"I remember the time when we made all these crazy shows and when people said, 'They're the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from abroad into the pre-election campaigns of the most protracted interparliamentary parliamentary elections
It is no wonder that the Pennsylvania 17th congressional election district seeks to receive money thanks to the transformation of the congressional districts, which will result in two existing MPs fighting for a single seat.
This newly converted Pittsburgh nomadic district is linked to the Democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who took his place in another area last spring of the year in a special election.
Lembs will fight another former member, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th district, which is largely covered by the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the cards were reworked.
The competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the party's main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became famous in Pennsylvania when, with a small majority, he won the widely-watched March election in the 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania.
Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won this area by 20 points.
The political experts provide the Democrats with a small surplus.
The U.S. considered the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners came out behind the door of the Trump organization's management team.
The decision of the State Department officials to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of a "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said H<0xC4><0xAB>ter Nauert, a representative of the Department, in a statement.
However, the penalties were considered to apply only to El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately 140 million large sums from the United States, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the restriction of targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where the level of unemployment and the number of homicides has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, the focus of which would be on security and economic well-being and which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as an attempt to bring the US closer together.
In mid-September, the country's top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending their considerations of punishing Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration is emphasizing the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious announcements or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, declined to provide further information on the debates characterised by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations if their anonymity would be maintained.
His story was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be retained.
Study of history
The second stone in the garden could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trump may have delayed justice, which has a lot of evidence in the public domain.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If there is a second party in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this body and perhaps also to the jury of his colleagues just as he is already in the process of meeting with voters again.
There are many 'but' and I did not say that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that we will have to make on all sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German leaders were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We ran out of gas and missed the opportunity to avoid the year-long bleeding.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he had secretly proposed to enter into negotiations with the president and argued about his inapplicability to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How can we be held responsible if the investigation of the FIB requested on Brett Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to be a High Court judge in spite of his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?"
And, most importantly, will we vote for the interim election of the Congress, which will call Trump responsible?
If we do not pass all these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed in everything we do by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once minted in my shipping house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the Sabbath candle on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorans) feels optimistic about the fight with Vienna "Rapid"
"Rangers" will take on Vienna's "Rapid" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive indistinguishable game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European G-League Group.
The road trauma did not allow center striker Graham Doransam to resume participating in the season games until an indistinguishable result with 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can enjoy it because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game believing that we were able to get good success and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but overall undecided is a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were left in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got good results in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my traumas and changes in the club itself, it was obviously hard, but now I feel new news, which I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, to leave last season behind and to succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they are worried about their pension deposits
While the survey participants knew clearly what care they wanted to receive, there were few people who had discussed this issue with family members.
About half of individuals in a national study indicated that they do not talk to a married friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by family members, but they don’t do anything to say it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to a married friend and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known already a good time in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with the amount of money to cover these costs, or an insurance through your property – the main thing is for you to have money.
Develop your own legal documents. Avoid legal battles even before they have started. The legal battles are over.
Talk to an authorized person about health issues so that you are a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act according to your wishes, if you are not able to express them to your own strengths.
Consider also the possibility of conferring a financial power.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so by your own strength.
And do not forget the seemingly detailed details! Imagine that one of your living parents is being taken to a hospital to get the necessary help.
Will you try to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Indicate these facts in the written plan, so as not to surprise you with such a situation.
"And it's not just about finances, it's about who's the doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan has been drawn up."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday has killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will increase.
Due to the delayed communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal (Donggala) region, located north of Pal and closer to the 7.5-magnitude strong earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pal and Dongal, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379 800 people living there.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and a tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017 there were 299 200 people living in the region, which is part of the province's administrative region.
Fishing and agriculture is the economic support of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially on the coast of the Dongala region.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, Sulawesi on the opposite coast.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Prevention Agency, Pal and Donggal have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and left hundreds of buildings in the Dongal.
Cunami also gasped over the western part of the Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes are regularly forming.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast line, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias (Nia) off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, in the south, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude strong earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters of tsunami waves that set off dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake approaching the Earth's surface visited the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, creating riots and panic, as it reminded of the destruction brought to it by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in damaged buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit Indonesia's tourism island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and temporarily caused hundreds of tourists to return home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Treks Peilins (Track Palin), the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Peilin, is arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report on the incidents she claimed to have occurred, he picked up the phone from her.
Pellins has been detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility, and he has set $500 in large security money, KTUU reports.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked if he recognized himself as guilty, he declared that he "definitely is not guilty".
He has been charged with three Class A offences, for which he may be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, for which he can receive a day-long prison sentence and a 2000 U.S. dollar fine.
It is not the first time that a criminal charge has been brought against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todam Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Peilin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
This case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of the report on domestic violence, and of carrying weapons in a state of captivity in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he's going to punch him in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peilin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from service in Iraq.
Earthquakes caused by a tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have been killed after the earthquake on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has laid off thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put in place and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake erupted near the central part of Sulawesi, to the southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are distributed, in which there is a moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city of Pau, when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to request a rare death penalty for a person suspected there of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saifullo Saifov (Sayfullo Saipov), who is being held on suspicion of a terrorist act in New York City, when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that in the state for federal crimes.
As it is claimed, 30-year-old Saipov used the Home Depot rental cars to make an attack on the highway in October along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he entered the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "with intent" killed eight victims and "with intent" caused serious trauma, as mentioned in the notice of intent to demand the death penalty, submitted to the New Yorker.
According to the court document, the death penalty may be imposed on both of these charges.
Within a week of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury adopted an indictment of the summons of Saipo to the 22 charges of responsibility, which included eight counts of espionage for the purposes of extortion, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as crimes committed by motorists.
The attack required "considerable planning and prior intent", prosecutors explained, saying that the attack carried out by Saipova was "horrible, malicious and inhuman".
"Saifullo Habibulajevi<0xC4><0x8D>s Saipov (Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov) injured, injured and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Djego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Kl<0xC4><0xAB>vs (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorcad De<0xC4><0x91>el
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since New York's Southern District District Attorneys have filed a complaint in a case where the death penalty can be imposed.
The accused, Kalid Barnes, was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life in prison in the end of 2009.
The death penalty was last committed in a New York federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were sentenced to death on charges of embezzlement in the Soviet Union during the war years.
The death sentence for Rosenberg was carried out in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, during the days and months, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret for the attack.
As reported by the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he got the inspiration to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also asked for permission to put the ISIS flag in his palace.
He has rejected 22 of the indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "deeply dissatisfaction" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty is not to accept the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to be released, but only extends the ongoing trauma to all parties involved," Paton said.
Saipova’s defense team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Conservative MP announces that the conduct of Brexit negotiations must be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL PARA<0xC5><0xBD>AM
During the protest, Nai<0xC5><0xBE>el Fara<0xC5><0xBE>s promised to "mobilize the People's Army" at a conservative conference today.
A former UK Independent Party leader said that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the MPs in the Mayan parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative-leaning member Peter Bone announced to the march in Birmingham that Britain would have resigned long ago if Mr Farage had been the minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Mrs Mejas will have to face in trying to narrow down her opposition party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who supported the EU's stay and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on Britain's and the European Union's relations in the future (Chequers compromise), and to feel attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The public insisted that she would resolutely try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would allow the aurocheptics and leiborists to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr Bouna's "Leave Means Leave" (excerpt) in the headline Solihull announced that he wants to throw Meja's plan in the weasel (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Farage an ally and entrust him with talks with Brussels.
"If he had been at the rally, we would have already stepped out," Bouns said.
Parliament's MEP from Velingboro (Wellingborough) added: "I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Mayan plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be servants!
We want to adopt our own laws in our country!”
Mr Bouna ignored the assumptions that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is absolutely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular in society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please step back from the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in place when they deliver on their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the dark should feel pressure if they are in danger of failing to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them do it."
In his message, he said: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit to us.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never give up until we get to the fact that we are an independent, self-governing, proud UK."
In the meantime, the Palic<0xC4><0x83>i moved through Birmingham before a two-hour hiatus took place in the city centre.
Unknowingly, activists welcomed conservatives against Brexit banners after a group meeting this week.
The Workers' Party representative Lords Adonis referred to the Conservatives on the security issues they experienced with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the IT system and all their technology for Canada and beyond, and still, to the undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Vorena plans to carefully consider running for U.S. president
Senator Elizabeth Vorena says that her "carefully considering" running for president of the United States after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the West Massachusetts City Council.

Saturday afternoon event Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, using the city council since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for president's office.

With regard to the murder of LSU basketball player Simsa has been detained
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspected person was arrested on Friday in the case of LSU basketball player Veida Sims.
The Baton R<0xC5><0xAB>d<0xC5><0xBE>a police station said that at 11.00 a.m. Daiteons Simpsons, 20 years old. ET press conference.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches world champion title after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the work of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
From the start, Bottas started well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his place in the first two trips and invited Fetela to attack his teammate.
Fetels first walked into the garage and left Hamilton in the suburbs to deal with the rest, it was probably the deciding factor.
The Mercedes pilot filled the lap later and withdrew from the Fetel, but Hamilton continued to lead after the force ratio, which saw Ferrari's drivers inevitably leave the inside free, risking to leave behind after a double-maneuver to defend in the third.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on the tyres to quickly reach the finish and heal Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
In the end, he arrived in the 44th round in the garage, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikonens remained fourth.
This is a difficult day because Valteri did a fantastic job at the end of the week and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one and two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her reluctance not to express the letter of Christine Bleisia Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in the headline in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak about Ford's testimony it gave to the Senate Legal Commission, but commented that what happened to the Senate shows that people there are "bad, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, have you leaked the information?
Do you remember her answer to the question... or did you print the document? — "Well, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
Whether we did it...No, we didn’t," he added, in the senator’s intonation.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter explaining in detail what Ford is accusing Kaveno of, and in early September, the contents of the letter were published, but Feinstein denied that it had happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't 'enforce' her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did too."
But her ban did not appeal to the president, who commented on the situation on Saturday night as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the president proposed that Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They're purposefully orchestrated to regain power by any means."
Do you see evil, coincidence, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said.

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on the plane to escape during an earthquake.
Some air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself to safely lift the plane with hundreds of passengers from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The territory continues strong in the afternoon and many are trapped in the dunes in the city of Pau.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganav<0xC4><0x81>ns Agungs refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the control tower of Palu Airport, which was shaking violently.
He remained in his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely be lifted into the air.
After that, he dropped out of the traffic control tower, thinking that it might collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation representative, Johannes Siraits, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to deliver it to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him today before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he said.
Meanwhile, state authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is thought to be a beautiful growth, as many more people's bodies are under the rubble, as well as many are not accessible," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative.
The waves, reaching a height of 6 meters, have left Pala, where a massive birch will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.

Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini" says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has disappeared, although before that it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crash aircraft.
Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not answer for one of the passengers — a man.
The airline has announced that it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals helped rescue other passengers by boat and crew after the plane sank into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The reasons for the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane crashed into the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitness accounts showed that the length of the runway was being re-evaluated on the aircraft.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and also other passengers were able to get out of the crashed plane using emergency exits because the water was only up to the middle.
He said that the guards fell in panic and shouted, as well as that he had a slight headache.
Marines from the U.S. Navy, who worked closely to improve the ship's landing, also helped rescue by using a inflatable boat to take people ashore before the plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years, no one is associated with "Air Niugini".
Psychoanalysis commenter explains the course of events on the night in which a woman was burned alive
The complaint on Saturday provided evidence again in the case under consideration, where a man is charged with the incineration of a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlets, a commentator on psychoanalysis at the U.S. Department of Justice’s Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a witness to an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the defendants how he used the information obtained from the phone to put together how the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old incarcerated Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rovlets said she had received location data from several phones, indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, disputing her previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers' time, when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified in court Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "melting because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted the messages, calls and contact information received by Chambers from his phone.
"He's going to wipe him out of his life," Heils said.
It is expected that the defence will give its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about this genre of music, with their music providing a positive message.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has shifted from its beginnings to the news of a political nature and when it solves the problems of a social nature.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced the recent revival of AK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York City, a widow complained of being fired after receiving "racist" news
In New York City, a widow has sued for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mistakenly sent a message from her mother, who complained that the widow "is black again."
The couple denies that they would be racists by comparing the court's right to "print".
Lindsey Plasko-Flaksman, the mother of two children, expressed her disapproval when she learned that the new babysitter, Gisele Mauris, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NECTION, ATKAL MELNAIS," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Mauri, in addition, twice.
Contemplating his inaction, the "samsussi" Plasko-Flaxman's dismissal of Mauris, pointing out that his former apprentice, who was an African-American, did a bad job and that he had been waiting for the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maury paid for her one business day and sent home with Uber.
Maur<0xC4><0xAB>sa has now sued in court for compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for a six-month period of work with the secured housing she originally applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the allegations that they are racists, claiming that the termination of Mauris’ employment was a reasonable decision, because they feared that after her apology, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasko, the husband, said "Post."
"But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened just because of mistakes?
Your young man?
But think about it."
When comparing court hearings to "printing", Plasko said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"Are you really addressing someone in this way?
It is not an acceptable action," added the investment banker.
While the proceedings are still taking place, the public’s views quickly go to court on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington's books were afraid that readers would not be able to associate with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said of the letter: "It is difficult to "put yourself in someone's shoes" who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising now to learn what we know about Paddington's great achievements."
Noting that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children on a small toy boat, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that on the 60th anniversary of the book's release there was a "cold rush" after the end of the war.
Speaking of Padington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly boasts of his eventual successes.
"He was a quiet, quiet husband and wasn't great," she said.
"But because Padingtons was so real to him, it was just like if you had a child who achieved something: you were proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
It seems to me that he looked at Paddington's successes in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the profits to Padington himself."
I had to give up my dying daughter by phone.
After landing her daughter with the rapids was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought continuously for her life.
"Neds called regularly and said it's very bad and it's expected that she won't survive," Ednana-Laperuza said.
"Then I received a call from Ned saying that she would die within the next two minutes and I had to give up on her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Yeah, I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart function slowly ended and left her body.
She would have died even faster and it all ended now.
I had to sit and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I could not enjoy or complain because I would find myself in a situation where there are families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to manage."
In the end, a daughter who was already suffering from loss, Ednan-Laperousa got on a plane with other passengers, who did not even have a sense of where she was going.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I put my head down and the tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but right during the flight I felt a deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and comprehension.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Sweeping women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicides
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, are acting to help others not to take their own life.
Sharon Deivis and Kelie Hamfries strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and get support.
David's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Deivis, 45, who lives in Lidnia, said that her son was a multi-souled cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognizes him by a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
However, he refused to work before he died because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
The goddess said, "I will always be worried that it will have consequences."
The goddess created the cards, "to make it known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit in silence – you have to talk.”
Humphrey, who has been David’s girlfriend for years, lost her husband, Mark, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that I felt sad or depressed or anything else I felt," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning —when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
His death was a great trauma for the children, but they have to cope with it: "It destroys the whole family.
It's up to us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Caveno's future in the air as FBI launches investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for — in a time and volume-limited investigation — we might be able to reach a little consensus," Fleiks said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "dear away"
Why does Kaveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their detention is just a coincidence.
The election is in five weeks, on 6 November — if, as expected, the Republicans feel bad, then their attempts will be significantly weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the highest court.
George V Bush called on senators to beg them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently holds 51 seats for Republicans and 49 for Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kaveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Michael Pens, the vice president, to decide the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "decreased" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
North Korea’s number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korea’s lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2011, when the number was 2,706.
Parks said that stricter border controls against North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
There were no public comments from Pyongyang.
The majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship at the end.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the most border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China’s political asylum-seekers are seen as illegal immigrants and are being forcibly deported.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearisation talks.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho was punishing US sanctions since these talks were non-existent.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally retaliate first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nessie Pelosi calls Bret Caveno "historical" and claims that he is unfit for work in the Supreme Court.
Court Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno "historical" and claimed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, they would call her 'historical,'" Pelosi said of his reaction to the testimony to the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Krist<0xC4><0xAB>na Bleizija Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoky, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats on the commission, citing accusations against him of "rapid and harmonious destruction" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believes that Kaveno's testimony is the reason that he cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with such statements and the attitude he's dealing with against Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when he asked her if she would try to question Caveno if she would approve him and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say that — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the current workplace,” Pelosi said.
Kaveno, currently, is a judge in the Washington District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possibility that Caveno will take decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation negotiations, Caveno questioned whether he would reject the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no suitable time for a hysterical and bipolar person to work in court, but we would expect from us that we would happily say, 'Isn't this wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
But women need to hold themselves in their hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has been "over the edge", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself to cry.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinemas told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, what do you think?"
She went on, "Once I was very helped by a woman who herself was a manager at a company who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a technique — when she became angry and started to cry, to the person I was talking to, "I was crying, I was crying, I was crying, I was crying, I was crying, I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I think that’s great.”
Assault as a form of anger discharge is only partially recognized, because they are extraordinary on their own grounds.
One of my brightest memories is from the oldest work in which the proportion of men was expressed, when I was once crying out for the unspeakable anger, when behind the beautiful tomb was an elderly woman, a reluctant leader (a woman), whom I was always afraid of.
"Never let them see that red!" she told me.
"They don't know you're in debt.
They think you're upset and will just be glad that you managed to "fall under the skin."
Patrizia Schr<0xC3><0xA6>der, then a U.S. Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart in his election to the campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, who was arrested in connection with adultery, left the ship, also called "making fools" and resigned from the elections, Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The elections were already seven other candidates and the last ones they wanted to see will be another one.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She later took part in the campaign, she withdrew the fundraiser and promised not to participate in the election unless 2 million US dollars were raised.
It was a lost battle.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1000 to male-level representatives, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — thanks to the people who supported her, she would be disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and the voters would not be able to talk about sex, and two would talk about sex.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they would write on my lap.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Beneficial for Beijing
The main defences of this as the beginning of the trade war between the US and China are hidden and as long as the fight does not see an end, disagreements between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing China’s main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the value of the unit of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) immediately, half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "well" answers every time, the latest being a five to ten percent rate of $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to the US one by one and is doubtful that in the near future, the world’s second largest economy could shrink.
In order for Washington to back down, it would have to agree to certain requirements, but publicly slandering the United States would have been too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its part correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can positively affect China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the economies of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision was taken either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than those previously acknowledged by observers," said Abigail Grees, a New American Security researcher.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily take back refugees and calls for help in restoring a country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids Almualems said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Right now, the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territory destroyed by terrorists to its normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still live in the country and they need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the restoration of the country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to sponsor the riots.
European golf team sensationally wins Raiders Cup race in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, beating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by Danish national Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was needed to beat the U.S. team.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the whole tournament, put his T-shirt in the water at PAR 3 on the 16th of the berth, joining the cat Fran<0xC4><0x8D>esko Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly played in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to get a 5-0-0 result since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
The American Jordan Spitt, 5 to 4, lost the European team sensationally, according to the ranking of the lowest-ranked player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to Ian Polter from England, for which this was possibly the last Raider Cup.
Eight Raiders Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, became the tournament's all-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Well, I don't run, but today I can't control the tears."
This was a tough year.
From the heart I am grateful to Thomas, for he raised me up and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
This is the team's profit and I'm glad I was able to help," commented Garcia emotionally after winning the European Championship.
He further gives the name to his compatriot John Rham, who on Sunday won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in 2 to 1 matches.
"It's the pride I feel when I win Tiger Woods, I grew up following this player's footsteps," said 23-year-old Rams.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a career record with 13-21-3 Raiders in the cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find their own talent, except for Patrick Riddle, Justin Thomas and Tony Fina, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. selection captain Jim Furicks after his team's unsatisfactory performance said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time today when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
All honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players won a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You need to touch your hats.
We won.”
Latest news about redness: The concentration decreases in Pinela (Pinellas), Manatee (Manatee) and Sarasota (Sarasota)

According to the FWC, flowering plaques have been reported in Pinela, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a reduction in concentration.
The red herring blooms about 130 miles from the Northern Pines to the southern coast line of the region.
The planks are located about 10 miles from the coastal areas of Hilsboro (Hillsborough) County, but in some places they last about a week.
The red carpet is also appreciated in the Pasco area.
