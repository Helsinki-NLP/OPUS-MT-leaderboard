Germany's new warship has been rescheduled
The German Navy's most successful new Ladaku ship Chiso Cold War-War War Ships was replaced by the Commission in the year 2014, due to the faulty system and snorkeling costs caused by the loss of cargo another year in the Riegel region, local media
According to the Garda Dy Jet newspaper, which quoted the military spokesman, the new brandco-head ship commissioning, Bedeen-Vyurtemberg-class new brandco, is now suspended for the first part of 201 9th century.
The project, which was launched in 2014 by the Royal Navy, was a major success in the development of the Port of Delhi's flagship project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg-class naval ships were replaced by the Magaiko Th<0xC3><0xB6>yo in 2007, now the Bremen-class frigate.
It is worth noting that a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft cannon and anti-ship missile launcher and some secret technology radars are presented in the form of radars, inverted and sonic signatures.
Other important facilities of the Lamo Murmat period include the Gardachh-yo new frigatehrulai domestic port port of Tardha, possibly a two-year lease.
However, the constant presence of the leading battleships of the Bhaneko Sea across the German Sea led to the entry into force of the Saakthio-Sevama force by the former Bela Samm, the Dy Jetle notes.
The diseased F125 frigates made headlines last year, when the German Navy relinquished the official RUMMA portal to the Commission and turned to Yassali Hambergama Bluhom and Vos Boat Prangan.
This was the first ship to be delivered by the Thio Navy, the ship's manufacturer.
While the German media was largely responsible for the "software and hardware errors" mentioned in the article, the German media was reluctant to take the large-scale warships deployed in the combat mission.
The private software company is responsible for the huge number of Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships of the 120th class, and the operation of the fleet of the old Bremen-class Ladaku ship is a popular asset.
In addition, it was reported that the ship's naval capacity was reduced to six times as much as the bulk of the ship's performance and limited to the Navy's capacity for advanced thrust in the future.
Germany's World War I experiment with the Gariaca-class destroyers is loaded with 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" on board.

A recent warning that Germany's naval power was being crushed by the new Ladaku ship, the Samatela, is becoming more and more important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelle, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "a soldier-worthy ship out of Nisko."
Officially, the issue is the time of the day of the big day, whereas the old ship's service is free of charge, which provides a replacement for Veslaharu Gari<0xC3><0xB1>.
He said that he was able to reach a naval base in the Baden-Wuertemberg-class Ladaku najazhharu.
