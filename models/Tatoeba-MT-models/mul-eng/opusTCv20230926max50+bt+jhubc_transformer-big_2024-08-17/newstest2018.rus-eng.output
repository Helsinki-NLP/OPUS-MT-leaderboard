Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and procedure of payment of goods (work, services) in the execution of purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of non-performance of its obligations by customers in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not get paid for already executed state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia gave the order to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers, who entered into contracts that were not backed by financing, anyway tried to avoid the obligations taken on payment and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interest of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor’s office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration of disciplinary responsibility attracted 4.5 thousand officials, to the administrative - 533, to the investigative bodies for the organization of the proceedings
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs was repaid in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Substantial debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
This is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for providing social transport services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his means of trading, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial burden on wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor’s office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been levelled as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor’s office operates under manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor-General personally conducts outreach meetings with representatives of the local authority, which deal with all the violations and measures taken by the Prosecutor-General to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers, which will be able to improve the implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ on amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences in connection with the establishment of administrative responsibility of officials of the customer for violation of time and order
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is awaiting disqualification for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group has issued a warning on the movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of Colored Population has issued a warning for color people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and attacks on racist soil.
The statement of the group reads as follows: “Warning of non-travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to show compassion.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of Colored Population, to declare a warning on the movement of the group has triggered a law recently adopted in Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win lawsuits related to discrimination, as well as the fact that their law enforcement agencies are not shy.
“You have people who are in violation of human rights.
They are being stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against the U.S. state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gasoline during a state trip, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without bringing charges of a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is to keep people aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to be prepared one way or another, whether they’ll take the money to pledge or tell their relatives that they’re traveling around the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th in the state by number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to the new law in the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a lawsuit against a legal entity in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement authorities were ordered to arrest people for violation of the ACLU, to commit immigration.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recent public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol in Egypt.
Unknown persons shot dead a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing Egypt’s Interior Ministry.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the other managed to hide.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
Rosturism’s head, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBC’s TV channel that “positively” refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free baggage transport for non-returnable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage,” he stressed (quote on TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transportation of top clothes and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all of our citizens and tourists and to say that, to say that it is to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer will not have a relationship," Rosturisma said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on the free carriage of luggage with a non-returnable air ticket.
The point is that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He mandated to identify sources of funding, plans and contractors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full recultivation of contaminated areas.
“It is also necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are worn out,” – RIA Novosti quotes the president.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct a verification of the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems related to the appearance of natural discharges and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the rest.
"I want to emphasize this: not everyone in a row to check, here too, the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of objects under environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin, in the course of a direct line, declared the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special regime of protection.
The residents of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, informed him about the problems with the conduct of economic activity.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are related to a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in Yugra.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous minority peoples of the North "Rachtinya", together with residents of the Berezovsky district take part in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is on the river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed already this year, now domes are installed, church bells are available.
The fleet's game-changer REB provided transport support.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosov, fishing gives the villagers a job, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school papers as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are the laws being enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the open air dining room.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while cucumbers carefully store a box of iron seized from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred meters to it - and throws the bull there.
The fine for garbage in the public place is 500 local dollars, - reports Chang.
You know, I've had just a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a phantom from a candy to a bridge, immediately fined.
And now there are video cameras all over the place.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as in a museum.
Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted the graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
What?!
Imagine yourself.
He got ten hits with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
In general, physical punishment is not uncommon.
As in Singapore, the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws are combined, the observer of the AIF understood on the spot.
“Nobody here is thinking about abolishing the death penalty,” explains attorney Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been interested in the opinion of both the European Union and the United States in this regard.
If a person carries out a large batch of drugs or trades them - he is placed on a leash.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders, and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the boy was eventually hanged.
After that, the drug dealers are carefully sidestepping our country.
The case is as follows: in Singapore it is stipulated that laws are to be observed by everyone in order, and not only by the modest and unwealthy people.
It doesn’t matter who you are, a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option in this case: if you find a shelf of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you are simply wondering - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is only sold in pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by prescription (!) of a doctor.
Tourists on arrival will not take the zucchini, but it is worth sticking the "resin" in the metro, will incur a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
For four days, I met two people with white plaques on their necks: "I was dirty."
Behind the abandoned urn, cucumbers in addition to the fine are often referred to as "a reference to the nobles": a week to remove the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. is paid by the "criminal", who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and in an attempt to cope with a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is worked - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of indoor plants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters to the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you are bound to break something.
This is not the case at all, - is trying to convince me Mohammed Kabir-Kadjaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone be attracted to them for their violation.
Why do they stay?
Don’t let the citizens relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let’s say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone will be punished on the chain: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hit with sticks on the “backside”, and the seller will also pose and put in jail.
It is because of such harsh laws that crime in Singapore is very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of the fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of the whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for the bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the apartment and send for years for the grill.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a variety of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - guests from the United States brought to the horror of the general wealth of residents, "terrifying a clean airport" and "cultural nature".
To say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first few days in Singapore and you’re really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you get excited if you get in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and all of a sudden - "disruption of the pattern": there are plastic cups at the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
It's all happening.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you must know that if it is calculated, you will not retaliate, for you have broken the law.
Most often, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often take out of the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
In our streets, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of dragon penalties and merciless (until the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll figure it out.
Such is the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was behind the wheel until they started to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary observance of laws.
And we have to think that in Russia, people would also be happy with the clean streets, the lack of trash in the subway and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here are the physical punishments - thank you, you don't have to.
In the rest of Singapore’s laws, at least, it’s worth taking a look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is aiming for the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it begins to fight statues.
The Americans understand this no worse than all the others - hence the deliberate theatrical portrayal of Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic torch over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
Counts of the owners of walking ships and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus' poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller said to Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, who dream of breathing freely, / The unfortunate rejections of your abundant possessions."
Never before have "unfortunate discards" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn’t do literature – he made it clear that in America, Trump doesn’t expect these people.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who were struggling to put her words on the statue posthumously – understood very well that they were committing a perfectly political act.
The sculpture by design was to mark the connection between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poetry the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
In 2010, a voiceless Rash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who heralded Trump’s arrival, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather she is an early neoconservative, carrying America’s flame to the dark world: “Freedom goes ahead.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against the usual Limbo here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends exclusively on the point of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been seen by the improbable, unfortunate, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Elyde Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scottish men in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of the Lightweight Athletics Federation of the United Kingdom, said the 16-member Scottish side of the World Cup team would make a “significant contribution to the team’s game.”
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the opening Friday of the 2017 London Championships.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is being born" and that the British Athletics Federation should take that into account.
“We know this and we’re trying to understand and we’ll support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it’s about what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, you have to work.
The British Federation of Athletics: With what they have done, you have to work.
People on the street think the same way.
I don’t know why this is happening, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish light-athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Elyde Doyle has chosen the team as her captain.
"Elizabeth is modest.
Her captain’s speech was great,” Blake says.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elyde put into it were wonderful.”
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth Championship, who at her fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British national team - it's "incredibly".
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who specializes in running for the middle distance, has beaten five British and two European records last year.
She runs at 1500 and at 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hara, who will compete in the 1500m race, is another Scottishman to pay attention to: behind his back is a lucky season in which he won the British national team and the annual competition.
Doyle recalls his first World Championship when, in addition to her, Lee McConnell was the only Scottish on the team.
The captain of the team says she is “incredibly proud” that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you was chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the team.
It shows how much we have accomplished.
And they're all the former athletes who will strive to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I was just paying attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just great.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: You don’t have to go into public office if you’re not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, was irritating.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the dumb, will behave like sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people, who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The subordinate governors called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of “well and what.”
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratically-advantaged state.
He is ranked second in the approval rating among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He showed a firm hand in the administration of the state and a commitment to its principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary method of communicating with his constituents and jokingly shows on his page his baldness after chemotherapy head.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by administration employees on taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, claiming that blocking comments is just their moderation.
But it's too easy - to use the image of trolls, spammers, and heathers, harassing on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan being a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about crimes on the ground of hatred.
“I have written a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of its response to crimes committed on the ground of hatred and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the article in the Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called conundrum, instead of admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the subordinates of the governor call a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call an "active life position".
In the Facebook era, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical leads, or arrest and shut the protesters' mouths.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users, who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria James K. Casheris, the chairman of the county's supervisory board, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by taking the voter into his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable email spending was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four times, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online project "Documents of George Washington", his office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Maritimes.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, of thought and of speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with it.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for home facilities at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferti hopes for home facilities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood in the Archerfield Links club, and moved in the direction of the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ills, attached to a new place and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re watching it come to success with this event,” Rafferti said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job setting this place up.
He is a strong supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour for his 32-year career.
“It’s really a special feeling,” said a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special feeling to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returns to the fight on his homeland of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again, and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how everything is going so far.”
In the field of this trio will join the former winner of the Masters tournament Ian Wussem and the champions of the majors for older athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrens are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmayer, and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if two or more people are in the car.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions.
The tunnels above the main roads, capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The country’s transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the roads in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric cars, implement a number of measures to reduce the flow of automobiles on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric trains and modernize the park of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev on the penalty
The Moscow court changed the punishment of disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, for a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the probationary period, explaining its request that Mamaev’s illness “impeds him from being in prison.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison with imprisonment in a general regime colony for the robbery of which the former Special Forces fighter has been a victim.
On 19 July, a court at a departure meeting in SISO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s “golden land”
After lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove.
It’s rarely even used badly.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a "nut", right in the gorge.
After half an hour, the fattening clubs are given and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she doesn’t have any furniture – and this is where she does her homework, like washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Many of them are common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many are drinking, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to go to the village after five o’clock,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupiers.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which retains tight control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaipur, the administrative center of the province, to Nabira, and then a five-hour trek on the rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in various shades of pink.
Few of the Indonesians came here, not to mention the journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pagodas worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this garment,” Degei says, pointing to his bright, hand-studded turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on the body.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy levels among the worst in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian gold land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport acquired gold and copper for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that the powerful Indonesian armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the papayas threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are mercilessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings of indigenous peoples in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” the report, published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report by the prosecution and torture.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the incidents take place every week,” says Andreas Harsono, who is researching Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The gaiks were delayed, as Papuan resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese lavochees, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than native Papuans,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, due to work.
“Because of this, the natives of Papua – the mother-mother (women) of Papua – have lost their sales market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known to the people as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former butcher has pledged support for 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” You said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokova Paniai experienced a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas hymns at the skeleton in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javette Thebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, pursued the children and beat them with examples of rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting bows and performed the waita, the dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran round and depicted the bird singing.
Some protesters began to pour stones into the police station and military base.
When the situation worsened, soldiers on internal radio were given the order: “If the crowd shows resistance more than three times, shoot them”, – so he sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine “TIME”, but which was not found.
Fifty-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, addressing the crowd with a request to break up their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I came back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but says the bullet flew off the side of a bunch of assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Jouva was hit three times, according to his cousin, who became a witness to the shooting.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, the senior police inspector of Papua, told reporters that his officers were only “defending” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pujo Sulistio, a Papuan police official, said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and far more were injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic delivered a speech in Jaipur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuses by the authorities in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never repeats itself again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately the answers were sent.
“Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeroes.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done,” he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to consider complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided by the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloodied vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been committed, including the incident in Paani.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with similar statements with a dark mistrust.
“I’ve been asked four times in the last three years, but there hasn’t been any change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid that the military will arrest me, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiai.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned while catching fish in a runaway river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry residents of the village protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, residents of the village poured stones into officers, who in response made warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution,” said twenty-year-old Dominga Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how quickly the wounded were being delivered.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called in for a response, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
The Panya has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the territory of the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by orchestrating sporadic attacks and raids by kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and indiscriminately detained by the military on the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a “careful, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of the rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The bread is not available to the same degree.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten clubs of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new migrants has increased, which has come in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing jobs are usually made available to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papayas rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “insufficient coordination with the relevant organizations” despite being given rare permits to conduct the video.
According to Felim China, the deputy director of the organization Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the election campaign of Djokovic to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development were not fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are facing new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Papua shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, refrained from the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so to hide the evidence of human rights violations would have been
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch human rights ambassador Kyes Van Baar, visited Jaipur on May 4, the locals broke the silence, asking: "We want freedom", as a source who has also been present at the ceremony claims.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will take place in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“Jakowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other papuas, consider their voice given to Jokovi, a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of non-compliance: buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military site.
Knowing that justice is likely to never disappoint, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seventy-story structure at an elevation of 337 meters.
This is already the second fire that took place in the high-rise building – which coincidentally is called “Fakel” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, there were no reports of human casualties, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a resident of the skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defense Department, fire crews extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government has reported that it is working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the administration of the “Fakela” after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected by the plating – the external panels used for the design and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the system of insulation and plasterboard panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East took advantage of a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which by 125 people or by 0,6% per annum.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign - increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased most significantly - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the hotel in Ida-Virumaa.
Andrei Malakhov has made it clear to the fans who are to blame for his departure
Andrei Malahov hinted at his fans on Instagram, who blame him for his departure from the "First" channel.
To date, he has not commented on any rumors, but today placed a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed with the tag "boss milk sauce".
The article on how to prevent the “burning” of the worker and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who took to re-format "Let's talk", it becomes clear what he hinted so clearly, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in a car explosion.
At least five military personnel were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, in the evening near the military checkpoint in the district of Girishk, a mined car exploded.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP took place in Girishka.
The armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Daver took a video of his camera being bitten by a shark
Daver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video of a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The film was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Scomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, according to the Necn portal.
The man during the underwater swim tried to remove the shark on the camera, which he held on a special stick.
After noticing the man, the animal more than three meters in length floated towards him.
The shark had begun to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in such a way as to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such a behavior of the marine animal turned out to be innovative for scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District came to the Elan Training Center, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to the Mash branch, which appeared on the page "VKontakte", contractors of the Ural military part number 31612 fought fiercely because of an unfurled bed.
It all started with the fact that the serial named Sayan demonstrably ignored the officer’s order to fill the crowded plain.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth round.
Sian supported the first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young boys were beaten in the barracks of the bed and sink, beat the glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass fighting.
The CVO has denied information about the porosity.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study showed that more than 20 percent of air passengers consciously or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the aircraft through U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent of those who had been placed on the plane, regardless of whether they had prohibited knives or other sharps.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition, or explosives in their possession.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and covering more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned from ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past ATB employees most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specifically passed through the examination of acute subjects, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through inspection at the airports, and how many had done so consciously.
It is quite expected that most often – consciously or unconsciously – smuggle smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
The head of the EPA Priuitt refuses to delay compliance with Obama’s emission reduction rules
The following day, after a 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama aimed at reducing emissions of substances, pollutants and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that now his agency is listening more than in previous administrations to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position, filed in the federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline for states to ensure compliance with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would delay their compliance for one year to give its department more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who, before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of rules that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewitt in return for the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s enforcement of a rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing the course regarding ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of meeting new standards in a timely manner.
"In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to make the deadline, after which he had been waiting for demands from groups of activists and others and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous post.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we are serious about the deadlines.
We are also serious about our constitution and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could at some point re-use its "authorities for delay and other data by law authority" to make sure that the rules "jcyjdfys on clear notice and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of ozone-related rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA's rate - after our demands - is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Mann, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, joined the suit.
Ozone at ground level occurs when ordinary contaminants from machines, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting ability can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt’s course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress Extends Removal of All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Board for the Restoration of the VFLA, which issued a report on Monday in which it recommended that the removal be put into effect.
166 people voted for the extension, against - 21, TASS reported.
The report of the IAAF Council stated that the WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Board for the reinstatement of membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA will be permanently disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
A report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent expert Dick Pound was then published, which spoke of numerous violations of the WADA regulation by Russian officials and athletes.

Aggravated defeat
Within the framework of the 3 rounds of the Fonbet championship of Russia among the PFL teams, the New Moscow "Khimik" held a away match against FC "Kaluga".
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The "chemist" did not concede anything to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to a foul goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat by the Kalujans at 0:3, many had predicted an easy victory for the hosts in advance.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoscians forced themselves to consider and act from the defense, but from the position of force.
In 1 time, the Kalujans were more creative and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave partners confidence with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Khimiku" did not have enough effort and luck to put a stop to the defense "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run on meeting courses.
The Novomoskovskys were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the Kalujans to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Khimik" intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the monks played their role - they performed the ending more politely and coldly, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Khimik" transferred the ball to the corner, the submission of which the owner of the field without resistance was transferred to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, "Khimik" demonstrated a good game, but suffered a bad defeat.
In front of our team is waiting for another departure - August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, the new Moscows will face the favorite of the group "Center" of FC "Ararat", which consists of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izlov.
Come support the "Chemical!"
The place and time of meeting of the Novomoscians - 18 h. 30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Eastern, d.2, corpus.
Composition of "Chemical": Syrotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Sviatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to the published decryptions of the phone calls, Trump has pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall on the border
The Washington Post published deciphering telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he will not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. president mocked him for publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t say that to the press.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In the published decryption of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a hot break was also found.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal, according to which the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia, was “funny,” “disgusting,” and “stupid,” and insisted that because of the deal signed by the Obama administration, it would look like an idiocy.
Trump ended the conversation, telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia of the Russians, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reported.
At the end of the follow-up point, officials of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city’s mayor, told reporters the Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic said that all costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles to the families of the deceased.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia’s leadership expressed its willingness to pay relatives who died as a result of the explosions of tourists’ flights and residence in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only confidence in the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudaut district in the warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic’s missile-artillery weapons, after which they began to detonate the large-caliber shells stored there.
As a result, there was a fire in the storage room, which provoked uncontrollable explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result, two citizens of Russia - Elena Polyakov, born in 1970, and Elena Tymofeev, born in 1962, were killed, who were on vacation near a hydrogen source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity were brought to the medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, there are seven people left in the station, the rest are written out.
Study of Russian influence on U.S. elections will be held by a large jury
Russia’s special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has called a grand jury in Washington to investigate Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives M<0xC3><0xBC>ller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury, which started work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son then another candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller had previously promised himself.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously said that since his meeting with Veselnitsky, he had been waiting for a compromise on the headquarters of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, information appeared in a number of media outlets that Trump’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitsky was literally dictated by Trump’s senior.
The White House said the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice-mayor Penza has been detained in the workplace
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshin was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee in her workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement authorities on the matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the SC SC has assured that they will follow soon.
Pence’s office has not yet commented on what has happened.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has curated urban issues and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the management of the State Building Inspectorate in the Penzance region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three underage children, it is remarkable that once again she became a mother a year ago, she gave up her leave of absence and returned to work.
Of course, in Mexico, there are no cosmodromes or carrier rockets.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person who has been in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are worn in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk on the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in Houston, USA, near NASA’s former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga appeared a monument to Yurius Gagarins.
That’s how the name of the first cosmonaut sounds in Latvian, and it looks like it’s 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Will Lose Lynch's Courts on Stage to Call for Justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury drove past the spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and with a swirling swirled to the small bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her off.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin stripe - stretched out with a cigar and looked through wind glass.
The people inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
The squeaks broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22nd, is just a staging.
But when Roger's neck was thrown into the loop, almost all the spectators were actually holding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Mors Ford Bridge to lose again the night the puppeteers lynched two black couples in 1946 - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s odd that for all these years, no one has been arrested — even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the film.
“It’s a stain on our history and it’s a stone on our souls.”
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former congressman from Georgia who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice,” he says.
“We can’t move to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covered the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say the city has always known two related motives of lynchings: politics and sex.
In April 1946, for the first time, the Supreme Court’s ruling allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
During roughly the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm punched Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumours spread in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of the prison and arrived at the Mors Ford Bridge, a crowd of snipers surrounded the car.
“It’s a dream that he organized and commanded the killings of Harrison,” the FBI said in a report.
“It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attempt at electoral rights,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a black signal in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you.”
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been leading the annual show, which reproduces that line-up at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Her show is spectacular, it captures the viewer and tells the story of the deep racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It’s hard to look and it’s even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that’s the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s courts because they show us our own uglyness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear that I’ve survived.”
Rehearsals of this year’s show began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest of blacks – gathered in the room and listened to a review of the play that was deciphered over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never been easier.
“I feel like I’m screwed because it’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigger, get out of my house!"
Raccoon screams in response.
It's a hit.
And at the same time, everything (at least all black actors) is exposed to hohot.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What is it?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I overplaying?
“No,” says Green with a laugh.
“I just don’t think white people were saying ‘nigga’ then.”
"Yes," laughed one of the black performers.
"You have to lose the hard 'r'."
And the energy in the room also changes: the discomfort is replaced by the feeling of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not just for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona says the word for the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends abruptly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in sad black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from her eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance; many live very close by.
They all endured for almost eight hours the heavy breath of Georgia, while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings remained only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are swirling right in the air.
When the last note of the song calms down, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and immobile bodies, and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” one little boy whispers, as if to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the audience, and suddenly it was over.
Actors throw strings off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show has finally fallen on him.
“It’s all right,” one of the women whispers.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience will sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta vividly discuss a show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinski finds it difficult to find words to describe what she feels after the show.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynchings are still going on,” she adds, “only now it’s called shooting the police.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, took over.
He says he has already started planning for next year's presentation.
“The stop is inspiring us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve been through, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are condemned to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations of the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonovskaya court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny for 300 thousand rubles for violation of the order of organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in Article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation "Repeatable violation of the order of the organization of the meeting".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakayev, concluded to consider the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of oppositioner Alexei Navalny, who was involved in the responsibility under the same article as Navalny.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which the supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on 8-9 July.
Seeing the agitmaterials that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police thought that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - public action (for which it is necessary to ask permission in advance from the authorities of the capital).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomasuyev applied for an end to the administrative proceedings due to the lack of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police allowed certain errors in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the "agitation Saturday", but he received an order obliging him to appear in the police department to tell about the event, which he actively participated in.
The same agendas were received by Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition – Nikolay Lyskin.
In Mordovia arrested the murdered bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, the 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several times at the guests of the event, who came to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case under article 213, paragraph “a” (“Holiganism”), paragraph 3 of article 30, and paragraphs “a”, “e”, “and” of article 105, paragraph 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (“Inciting to kill two or more persons committed in a general way, from hooligan riots.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the guests of the wedding, after deciding to bathe, passed through the territory of his site to the water.
Minenergo tightens requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
At the launch of gas turbines, gas turbines, oil-trapping facilities and oil extraction equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the Government was already ready for public discussion.
The new requirements will only apply to “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The potential threats in the document are called phenomena such as access to information and access to control of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On August 4, the press service of the European Union said that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against Russia have been extended due to a scandal with the Siemens production turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to bypass the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries for the extension of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be taken by the end of the day, and here the decision is made, sanctions against Russia are extended.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to bring the business back to life.
On Friday, the British education group of companies “Pirson” announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of pre-dividends by 72 percent as a result of the start of a new restructuring program aimed at fighting their business problems.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon’s chief executive, will mainly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US$394 million) in May during its third cost-cutting program to try to get back into business life, which hit a rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed as a result of deadly explosion
According to information received from official sources, the terrorist-killer attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Karabakh urban area.
The blast was the last of the blood-soaked attacks in Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed as a result of Tuesday’s explosion at a mosque in Gerat.
On Monday, a terrorist-killer killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which took place on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “self-propelled explosive device portable by a man.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, an explosion of a suicide bomber in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attack.
On May 31, more than 150 people were killed in a powerful explosion in the center of the city, the country’s deadliest number of human casualties since U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence is accentuating an unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has canceled the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law that states should limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states filed a lawsuit against the agency because of the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone Measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and the responsiveness to them,” Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced its intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced, so that it meets the stricter standards of air purity in 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, for the most part democratic, along with the federal district of Colombia filed a lawsuit alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
On the website of the Environmental Protection Agency, it is written that the use of ozone-containing air "may impair the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms", for example, asthma.
The Association of European Business Opposes New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Business has expressed disagreement with U.S. economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the EBA, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB said in a statement that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from EU countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and consensus.
MPs ask police to restrict movement on the Pskov embankment
Pskov’s people’s voters sent a call to the head of the UMVD on the city of Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the coastal river Velika.
The deputies of the pride of Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, controlling the drivers will help make this territory more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the intruders ignore the signs of the "walking path" and roam freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that the capital repair and refurbishment was carried out.
Sports and children’s playgrounds because of the cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov news agency, in the evenings, the central coastguard is patrolled by the employees of the PPS and the spouses.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin has demanded that investigative bodies not remove hard disks
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to ban investigative bodies from removing servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
This was announced by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, “it is necessary to exclude the use in the interests of investigating measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, secure them and use them in the course of the investigation."
The head of state added that it is not possible to “create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until it is impossible to pay taxes”.
Olga Buzov told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzov admitted that she very much wanted to call her ex-husband, footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with working issues.
Just the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on Instagram.
She said that she did not marry, did not make new tattoos, and did not name her ex-wife with the words that he had ruined her life, although she was very eager to do so.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fadge in a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the 92nd year of life.
This was reported by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
The actor’s death was told by his relatives.
According to them, he lived “a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television for 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, at the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played alongside Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy also remembered the repeated performance of the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenplays of Agatha Christie's works on Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981) he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt more than once.
Something was lost in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and in fact Henri Marie Jean-André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried along with his vengeful wife, Queen Margaret.
This year, the four have a "golden" wedding, but on the agenda of the couple - not preparation for the celebrations, but a funeral dispute.
His highness refused the title of prince-consort, while he banished it to the queen's address, which he never regretted the title of king-consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's wife.
Russia's Foreign Ministry calls on Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to statements by Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The corresponding statement was circulated by the Foreign Policy Office some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using the cold war prints, inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
As the “Arguments of the Week” wrote the day before, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup d’état in Montenegro.
Mothers Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, who are believed to be moving steadily towards having the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, did not walk down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, a world boxing champion.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories by Eleanor Bronner on Saturday on the showtime channel, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noted that a potential decisive battle between them would be at once.
“I used to be in a light weight,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled.
“I was promoted to the category for the Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big anymore.
I'm short for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to get up to half-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll make a match.
That's what fans want.
Let’s fix it for them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he adheres to, that Lomachenko will hold his debut fight at 135 later this year, to appoint next summer a meeting with Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a (37-0, 30 knockout), who will also be in charge of
“The fight can be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said, later expressing willingness to fight on the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready.”
Garcia said he believes Lomachenko is a “surprising boxer” and may attend his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately kiss Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the blow, and then the box.
They both said they feel as the tension increases before their own fight.
“This fight has to take place.
No other fight has caused so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will cover the movement for the weekend
On this weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic will be limited in the capital on Tverskaya Street from Nastasiinsky Avenue to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street 1.
In addition, the drive will be closed on the Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yamska Street.
On all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, reports the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight of August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their renovation.
Also on the weekend will be closed the movement on the part of the Moskvoretskaya embankment.
The construction of the Zaradye Park continues there.
Putin ordered the Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to carry out an inspection of the territory of Baikal on the subject of facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to examine the territory of the bay on the subject of facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of the violations will be revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results from the Swedish asylum-seekers’ tests, which were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Judicial Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make an age assessment in the process of granting asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed they were underage.
Currently, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the subjects were assessed as persons 18 years of age or older, and according to another 25 cases, the forensics agency estimated that the subject was “probably a person 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where a person's age raises doubts.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson from the Agency of forensic medicine, the results correspond to the results over the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference with the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people have been assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely to be 18 years of age or older tested.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that he is 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, consisting of doing an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to the analysis of dentists and x-rayologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolingian Institute, Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through sexual maturation before or after the usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we should use the measurement methods that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with confidence, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransen from the Agency of forensic medicine said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistakenly adopting a child for an adult child.
The biggest risk we face is when a person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I wonder if I can run for president.
During a working trip to the Buryat, Vladimir Putin was puzzled that he was ready to think whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to the request of residents of the village of Cheremushka Buryatsk region.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be held, we ask you all to run again for this post.”
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on statements by some media that Vladimir Putin’s pre-election headquarters will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Viino.
Peskov called these assumptions “nothing based on, hypothetical reasoning.”
"Until there are no headquarters, until the establishment of headquarters is far, until the election campaign is far," Peskov said.
“Until it is on the agenda,” Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party.
The governor of West Virginia, a representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Jastis said.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I say to you, people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a democratic governor.”
The meeting exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I’m going to change my registration for a Republican,” Jastis added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Trump previously promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent lead, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement saying that “the transition of Governor Jassis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is rather hindering than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justin’s statement is just one more rejection of the party, which has no leaders from the top down and is unable to find a positive, unifying statement in the news release.
Cat-heavy named Mr. Krasavchik found the house thanks to social networks
The town of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) has set up a cat named Mr. Krasavchik weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat with a request to find its owner was posted in the pet’s account on Facebook because “someone apparently fed him before.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal’s muzzle can become a new meme.
The publication has garnered more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to welcome Mr. Krasavchik.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American woman said she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users paid attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with the photograph of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Kou praised Russia’s “sincere” apology for the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Kou on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate again in sporting competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Shlyakhtin told the congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in Light Athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and fair.
He apologised to “all the athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to preserve the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the state-sponsored evidence of the use of doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s answer, today’s report were very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Kou, told reporters.
“The whole Council and the whole Congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the reconstruction of the Federation.”
Kou said he also “liked” that Russia agreed with the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of a special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” said Kou.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the blocked system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will take part in the World Championships in Athletics under the neutral flag, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements are yet to be met for the restoration of Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the drug testing is still not being carried out in sufficient volume, and the removed coaches are still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a state man.
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky has been arrested for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication "Journal Zhytomyr" is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and in an attack on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities’ measures against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Commander Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the navy of that country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposition cabinet and Tobruk-based Libyan parliament have accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Haftar gave his subordinates orders to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they do not believe in these threats and intend to send another military vessel into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saradzha.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegals that have entered the country from Libya: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The Government said that the resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A large-scale crash occurred on Skype.
A global failure in Skype’s work has been recorded today in several countries of the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began mass sending complaints to the developers of the program.
At Microsoft, they stressed that experts are already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, RIA “Novosti” said.
Let’s remember that in June of this year, Skype also failed.
Users were unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine on light athletics removed from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the team of Ukraine for the 2017 World Championship in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the instigation of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) disciplinary proceedings in relation to athletics.
The composition of the Ukrainian delegation also excludes coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
Povh is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the European champion of 2010 in the relay 4 by 100 meters, Zemlak - the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the relay 4 by 400 meters.
The World Championships in Athletics will be held in London from 4 to 13 August.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs do not prevent the world record holder of the transfer of Neymar from the Spanish “Barcelona” to the French “Paris Saint-Germain”.
Whatever the consequences may be on the chain, for the Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power the teams are prohibited from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
According to UEFA’s 2011 Fair Play Financial Rules, PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a lawsuit that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
The PSG can certainly be torn apart to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling Qatari family.
The clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French football player believed that clubs falling into huge debt in their pursuit of success, in essence, were swindled and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, the FFP ceased to focus on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spend in order to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During this three-year period of assessment, which is exciting for 2018, the clubs could suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite Platini’s shameful removal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive and we, moving forward, will tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the purchase of Neymar’s contract at the same time, it can distribute this amount for reporting the entire term of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual report as costs of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 heavy sanctions were applied to PSG, as well as to Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
The PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at that rate it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014–15 season by 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to override its financial inspections by diluting their income at the expense of the companies associated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could offer PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the amount of PSG funding from Qatar’s Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the PSG.
According to the most recent published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that Neymar’s arrival will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and t-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Unquestionably upset by the departure of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares doubts about La Liga's financing of the club by the state.
“It’s all the consequences of participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and venue of the swearing-in will determine the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law developed by the State Duma Committee on Law and State Construction.
A week ago, MPs planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, following from the revised text amendments to the draft law "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation" (at the disposal of "Izvesty"), which the committee will consider before the second reading on July 11.
The idea of introducing the oath when entering the citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
MPs drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v.
According to the draft law, its logic was this: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - got on the path of extremism, he breaks that promise.
In April, the bill was introduced into the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Justice Russia") and the speaker of G.D. Voché.
On the 19th of May, the deputies accepted it in their first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Interior.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the Russian coat of arms is possible is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal institutions, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be ZAGS.
To carry out a solemn oath wishing to obtain the citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after the officials will check their documents.
But the Russian passport a person will receive only after he takes the oath, follows from the finished text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the order.
The updated text says that the oath of office of Russia will be from 18 years, not from 14 years.
There is a rule that exempts those who are incapacitated or who are incapacitated from taking the oath, as well as those who are unable to pronounce, read or sign the oath by themselves.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons",
Also in the updated draft law there is a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of the citizens of Ukraine, who are considered carriers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship, making a corresponding statement to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Refusal of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons that are not dependent on the person”.
Corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first deputy speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Irat Farrahkov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision about their nationality of the Russian Federation, - explained on the eve of the head of the Duma committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have given up their “other” citizenship in writing and handed over their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons other than its dependent country” it has not ceased to be considered citizens.
Now foreigners are prohibited from occupying positions in the municipal service, to be admitted to work at facilities and in organizations, the activities of which are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law will come into force from September 1, 2017, by that time the necessary sub-legislative acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "The Bright American Summer" and "The Warehouse Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgicly reminds us of the glorious days of characters in the 80s; of the era of the 90s (about the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made the comedy sketchy "The State" itself for MTV);
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronism.
“The first day of camp” was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of a vegetable-talking bank, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; as a result, the impossibility of returning to being a part of the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from 90s Stalker films like "Hands Jumping Rabbit".
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the plot moves are the same.
The Goodwill Cup (Shooulter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet divorced his virginity.
And there is still a crazy and false conspiracy, in which Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter) is involved, which is now instigated by George Bush the Elder (a tried and tested parody performed by Michael John Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the withdrawal from it.
Especially fun to see the forever young Radda, who sings the song of Matt Dillon from "The Ones", whose character, the former big man Andy now looks like an old lady.
Bringing this franchise success could be a random craze in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it comes to what, I think, would be its logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: A Hot Company Would Have Been Gone Twenty Years Later", where at the end of the movie
Amazon's "Cooper Detective" refers to a different type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans", "Explosive Blonde" or even "Bleak" with its images of fighting East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gateswood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist pout.
The main roles - which saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelius Ulich, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a game of chess, as Americans might watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slater, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevinyi - allows interesting to play in the "guest voice".
But Comrade Detective is so held up for the veracity of the nexus of the propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed, and it’s funny not very and not often.
If it were to be done shorter, Comrade Detective would be better able to cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the U.S. Embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginative communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of anything to make a beekeeper.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them as well.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will amount to about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there are almost no tickets for the match.
The Spartak-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 9:30 p.m.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Uffizis cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The next day, a 37-year-old Ufimetz, who owns a furniture company, approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The extraction of ware became tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, perforator, hydraulics, swivel.
The police began to search for the criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first hit car service.
The case of theft has already been initiated against them, and the law enforcement has managed to return to the rightful owner only part of the stolen instruments.
The State Department commented on Medvedev’s words on relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Duma, Heather Nauert, in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “areas for interaction”.
“Look at the truce in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
“And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” the RIA Novosti diplomat said.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to the trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, US President Donald Trump, signed into law last Wednesday.
However, he admitted that the document failed and was contrary to the U.S. Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillierie - has complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They featured five new rings and three collar-chokers on the barhat tapes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and pendants made of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of gliptics (hand carving on stone) and respect and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses grown in his estate in Granville by model Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Cathelan.
Trump found guilty of worsening relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out with sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later circulated a statement by the president in which he said the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer together.
The Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya has withdrawn from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of the subsidiary of Sberbank.
The decision was explained by the RBC’s intention to “focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move will be a "best investment in time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank’s unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected in July the application of the consortium of NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriyev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the country’s president Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One such financial organization - in addition to VTB and Vneshekonombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
With explanations about what happened, the head of the department, Alexander Novak, spoke.
According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity due to a road and transport accident on the territory of the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the power transmission line, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
The failures in the power supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists removed the malfunctions within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could be abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and debilitating inflation have forced rumors of a possible increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain unsustainable, and left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on family incomes.
Specialists of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for keeping the rates at 0.25%, while this month fewer members of the committee voted for the rate increase because weak economic growth weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes will continue, while it is still expected that inflation will rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank has warned that rate hikes over the next few years will be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that it is likely that borrowing costs will have to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan, according to which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he has announced that he will now have to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion – up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion under this plan.
In a decision-making protocol on rates, the bank said: “According to the basic forecasts of the MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, it would take "some tightening of financial policy", in "somewhat larger" size than expected by markets.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one – in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “gradual” and “limited.”
The bank’s forecasts for this and next year’s increases are lower than forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent uncomfortable growth rates weakened the increased expectation of an increase; then GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank’s representative, growth is expected to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank’s latest report on inflation has given little reason for the joy of households, which were hit by high inflation and very slight increases in wages: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before falling.
The bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” the gains over the next few years, but expects that salaries will “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, due to the low rate of pound, which compensates for some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
According to the bank, it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rates, there was an increase in the noise around the proposed rate hike, as inflation was increasingly pushing for and thus experiencing strong pressure on households: three members of the expert committee were asked to raise rates to 0.5% per year.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this decline was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montleik, director of Mortgage Brokers Korea, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and are well-intentioned.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of a lack of commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will prescribe the drug that caused the dispute for HIV 10000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High Court over funding the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (pre-eP), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk, on average, by up to 86 per cent, will now be available for pre-treatment.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Appellate Court upheld last year's High Court ruling that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay for the PrEP, despite her statement that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was named “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point.”
Prior to the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As research has shown, PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people in the risk group.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, there are a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients who are entitled to receive the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not known if their HIV status is restricted by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the upcoming venereal dispensary taking part in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a contract to provide the drug this week after an international procurement tender.
The study was built in such a way as to assess all the capabilities of PrEP at the expense of collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its adaptability and its use on a large scale.
“This important innovation should complement and reinforce the broad-based and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV,” he said.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Office for the Control of the Spread of AIDS), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The EPP, if it is properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people in the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening new means, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is rapidly rolled out across the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we’re provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we’re going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it was very late due to months of delays and wires from the government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the cessation of transmission of this term infection.
This test will bring us closer to a step towards a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible across the country to protect individuals at risk of HIV and to move us further towards an end to the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars passed a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which he noted the importance of retaining the position of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post - "positively established form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the Assembly stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.”
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan was signed on 24 July 2007 for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and to retain the name of the head of the region.
Today, Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation, which has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called "President".
There are difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (ITUs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in a row, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on holiday abroad on their car or take it there for rent.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in fact, it all depends on specific police or rental offices: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and some require enough national rights.
To be sure, international rights drivers still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all units of GIBDD, Kommersant reports, conducting research in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in the units of UGIBDD, plates are simply not issued, the forms are not enough for four months already.
You can register for admission on the website of state services, but there the line has already stretched to the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk the Ministry of Internal Affairs is impossible to obtain "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistrov: “Imagine why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?”
That's right, because the forms have been completed in all departments of GIBDD.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international law very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time it is pushed far forward, on the spot the talons do not give out at all (but the button is there, but the talon can not give).
It looks like a public service portal shows that in the Spb free time to Fig.
Did anyone try to get it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licences have changed, so in the units of the Gosavtoinspektion, the delivery of new forms is carried out.
There may be a deficit associated with this, but it is not clear what changes are being made that have not been reported before.
Blanky buys the Center for Special Purpose in the Field of Road Traffic Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to GIBDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand forms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were made, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with JSC "First 70 printed two
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to conduct the tender in time, which led to a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people started to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, to the end, is unclear, so people are being reinsured, and therefore there is a huge demand for international "shorts".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualification.
This was the proposal made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new model's International Driving Licence (ITU) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
About this on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "The Spy".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or hook in there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there is actually no prospect of this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can’t build less large-scale objects normally.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so far short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast is completed a comprehensive assembly of the highway arch of the Crimean bridge: its complex will be closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the lighthouse supports," - said in the information center of the project.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility goes ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
In Spain fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was to have the head of the Spanish official Carlos Resio?
The permanent walk has been extended for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.
This is not the case in the world of bureaucrats.
Visitors seem to have long been accustomed to all the jokes of the "servants of the people".
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live on well.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an employee of the Valencia archive, Carlos Resio, managed to not go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he regularly received a complaint.
And the whole solid thing is 50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's "strange times" are over.
He was fired at the decision of the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
During the investigation, it was found that an angry walker came to the office every morning at 7 a.m. to note in the electronic system.
And immediately he went home.
Again, he appeared at the workplace at 4 p.m. to again note in the system that he left.
Ten years.
It also became known that all the leisure time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now, the deputies of the Valencian legislature are thinking about how to punish and direct chief Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to “actively work” in his workplace he is subordinated to.
Judges offer protection from presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SCHR proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Courts and to introduce their elective powers.
For the courts of appeal and cassation of the Supreme Court of Justice wants to introduce special districts, which will not be tied to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The SCHR has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the order of Vladimir Putin of January 3, 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the members of the Council.
During the meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitral proceedings were discussed, as well as problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens (see "I" of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the SCHR, 25 proposals were made, which dealt with both issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court, in the opinion of the SCHR, should present him for appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
To do this, according to experts, can be a specially written computer program.
Also, the SCHR believes that the president is not entitled to “predict the results of the judge’s qualification certification, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “assign them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation.”
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the presentation of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the SCHR proposes to reorganise appeals and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The SCHR says that “it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation bodies not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts take the practice of arbitral tribunals as the basis.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee, at the expense of this, greater independence from regional officials, which make the use of “telephone law” difficult.
The World Court of Human Rights (WCC) proposes to strengthen people’s councils to consider with their participation some “categories of civil and administrative matters”.
For example, about deprivation of parental rights, about restoration at work, about protection of honor and dignity, about deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are just our proposals," said the "I" member of the SCHR, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamara Morshchakov.
She also recalled that the President’s mandate was not only to the LHR, but also to the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the order by the police (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the human rights officer in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the independence of justice is being ensured in the Russian Federation, the President of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev should be until September 1.
Living a High Life: Semi-detached and clever design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home
In 2014, Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repair, moved from a spacious house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and in favor of a new design says that Joan did not collect her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price the same day.”
Since the first viewing, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Originally it was an apartment with a one-bedroom complex layout – to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen – and Joan wanted to add space for storing things and a half-floor to maximize the benefit of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use ceilings at 12.5 feet in height and create housing that would not only be a successful project, but would have been enough for Joan to live on.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor where you could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the spaces above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in a secluded space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from «Retrouvius» opens the view to the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirrored furniture with a gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serzh Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store the entire dish Joan.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enliven the kitchen itself when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it moves up the door, as in the garage.
"Engineering art was used here," - Erfan will tell about the reinforced steel wooden-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the rational use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the gender area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for,” says Erfan.
“To put it bluntly, a real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the area of the sexes.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the sex, using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is a testament to the fact that due to good design and increased metering, the apartment can turn from something ordinary to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government has approved the establishment of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant resolution was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop drafts of a cultural policy strategy, refine the tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chairman of the Commission is appointed Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low
Consumer prices in G20 countries have fallen to a minimum in the past eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% – lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index of 0.1% in Russia.
Thus, the department recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017 .
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the version of this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin Warns of Illegal Excavation of Bike Tail
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on environmental development of the natural bayal territory, warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows the forest to be cut down during the fires, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not cut out everything in a row".
Donska noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the supervisory authorities.
Media: VSU fighters secretly out of command negotiate with Donbas militias
On the line of armed confrontation in Donbass there is regular telephone communication.
The fighters of the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
VSU fighters and Donbas militias have secretly established a cell phone communication from their high command.
This is reported by "Strana.ua" on August 4 with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbas.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know perfectly the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not at all common: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Often, the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of the cases when congratulations on the birthday of one or another officer received because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
VSU fighters and DPR and LPR militias have been sitting in the line of demarcation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of UN Security Council statements on attacks on the Russian Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy department, they are outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives, who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2, for the third time a month, was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorist groups "Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (former "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Armanac"
Taking into account that the international community unanimously opposes the "Nusra" designation as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions do not call to oppose this structure, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation noted that "it would appear to itself that the "Nusra" terrorist attack should be a deterrent and should be a deterrent to everything.
However, as the diplomats emphasized in the diplomatic ministry, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tonality of objections, covering the arguments for the alleged lack of necessary information, <0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB9>
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the minds of these delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity,” the foreign ministry said, adding that “I would not want the Council to be created with these barbarians.
Vladimir Putin has called for limiting the number of out-of-the-box checks of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of out-of-plan inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% from the number of planned ones, and said it was necessary to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
“Explanatory checks are usually carried out without appropriate agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor’s office, everything else goes on its own,” the president of TASS said.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from removing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to business activities or related to a violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "E", due to the action of the moratorium on carrying out planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted with 19% of respondents, before which it was found that in fact there was a replacement of the planned checks by the out-of-the-box (the share of the respondents increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), before the prosecutor’s office, before 16 %, before the prosecutor’s office (in 2016).

The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
The two brothers fight for one of the largest in the state of Victoria empires in real estate trading worth more than $500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former football club director Carlton and developer Colin de Lutys lives in the Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is still a heated dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the firm "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of properties today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom Paul describes as the “main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin has ruled it out.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the statements given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority,” he wrote.
The court costs are growing like a snowball: hundreds of pages of statements, emails, and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the Queen's attorney and the Queen's lawyer Allana.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they had run milk bars and gastronomics, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of school, and Paul was a boy at the time (about 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi often told me that she didn’t want the brothers to get together in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, though he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGee, the star's best friend.
"Ferfax Media" on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He replied only to Colin, a text message that said that, since the case had not yet been considered in court, "I really have nothing to say".
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and to sue for our family name,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and I arguing in court,” he said, adding that “there’s still hope for a resolution of the conflict.”
On Friday, this hope seems to have spread.
“The decision on our case will soon be taken by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump’s apparatus plans to restrict access to information to the president.
Others tried to do so and suffered a defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly will be able to do that.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politics" reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, - hoping to keep the boss in a more calm state.
That's what reporter Josh Doozy says.
“At a meeting held by the new head of the White House apparatus, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he pointed to the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information coming to the president.”
Kelly told employees that the information should go through him – in paper form or through briefings – because the president would be better off making decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed to appease Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump’s relationship with television came a few decades ago – and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, being a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received a fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former political adviser, said in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that “according to six former election staff members to keep under control Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to monitor that the incoming personal information contained a constant stream of praise.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter has ever been “under control” is just ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don’t know, for example, that if it wasn’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump hasn’t posted.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by submitting to Trump material – reliable or not – that confirms their views.
"Politics" - just before this story - wrote in May about the tendency of the advisers to constantly give the president dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and won’t rest until he finds out who was behind them.
That’s what happened at the end of February when someone pushed the president to print an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus, Katie Welles, was accused of “standing behind a number of leaks” at the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then turned down them.
Trump read the article and accepted to ask employees about Welsh.
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the Rains Pribus apparatus and the secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus “tried to build a system to manage the flow of paper that Trump receives and document them.”
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office Fights HIV-Dissistant
The prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kaliningrad court of Tyumen, which has suspended the criminal case against a local resident who has died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is HIV-deprived and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumeni was brought under article 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death due to negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection at stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman was not treated by herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,” the prosecutor’s office said.
The criminal case was brought to the Tyumen District Court of Kalinin, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "forgive a wife who has no claim to her, she smoothed out the damage and made excuses".
The Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the termination order be revoked and that it be re-examined.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As reported in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to make a diagnosis, started taking drugs," said Elena Loseva, the press secretary of the Center for AIDS.
According to her, it is impossible to affect parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children are able to be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV-dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissidents movement.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and they see a serious threat in their spread.
The yellow photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of young people was walking by a bridge over the railways, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends came up with the idea to make an effective selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FACTAM" in the communication sector of the police in Khmelnitsky region.
The boy began to descend from the bridge on the train, but due to his inattentiveness stuck behind the power line and immediately got hit by the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station’s dispatcher, who immediately called for an “emergency”.
Before the arrival of the injured doctors were moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the fire department of Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with burns of the torso of 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind that more and more recently, extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storey, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
Police are calling on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus, there could have been oceans.
French scientists have come up with this idea.
Specialists have created a computer model that has demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history, oceans formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their studies concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of a shooting at a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, the Associated Press reported.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them pulled up a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, since they had everything but the eyes closed.
Another was given medical assistance, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular place among locals and tourists.

Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group prepares a conceptual show that will be the brightest in the band’s concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
His name is associated with the famous anti-autopia novel by O.Haxley "On the Strange New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, a blind faith in propaganda and imposed values.
To raise money for the recording of the album the band helped the audience: on the site "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album, "Do the Gromche!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We Are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with the symphony orchestra in Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of the World".
The group consists of Lusine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaliy Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (barabana).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in the different nominations of the hit-paradise "The Devil's Dozen".
The Gypsies have overcome the trenches and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are again conflicting with the determined gypsies, who have overcome the mines that have been excavated by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in the field, bordering the rich street of Solihall, which was nicknamed the “street of millionaires”.
Bringing with them horses, infants, and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were driven out no further than in May, and did not prevent them from being dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through a site that had left unfenced to leave a place for the trenches.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihall, saying it was "incapable of solving this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening after they were driven out of Bentley Hit, where they were hurling stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, chased them away, and here they are again.
Last night came even more gypsies, and today, maybe even more.
“The Birmingham municipality knows how to solve this problem, they are getting long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay a municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to that.”
One local resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse riding on the meadow.”
A representative from Solihall said: “We know about an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
In order to assist us in the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to imagine the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea launches champagne wine factory "Novyy Svet"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "Zavod champagne wines "Novy Svet" decided to act, transforming into JSC "Zavod champagne wines "Novy Svet", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyuchina.
100% of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the ownership of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5,955 million common shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles. each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if no funds are found for the modernization of the enterprise in the next three years, there will be a threat of a plant shutdown.
The export of the main funds in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations is difficult,” said the deputy head of the Crimean Minselkhoz Sergey Petelin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatisation plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its shareholding and put it on the market.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, investment of the investor in modernization - another at $30 million.
“New World” in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 levels – to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, "New Light" was intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Leo Golitsin as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the acquired name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders have destroyed more than 40 graves
The employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 graves at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers turned out to be third-class students.
The first statement that the burial plates were damaged by unknown, arrived at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people have been contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Destruction, damage or dishonor of the places of burial” was initiated.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they found two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fell, and this prompted them to take hooligan actions.
Preventive activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone against the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs belonging to the rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turkish daily Press.
Minniti’s warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which only worked for a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambroseo Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone right now,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will only be able to assess all the allegations made right now after we have collected all the information and will be able to assess the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship Juventa, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken on board the migrants, who were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowed smugglers to leave along with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather than humanitarian fury, than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct mainly assumes that Juventus-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: "Save the Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Expanded Volumes" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they do not involve any "significant changes or disruptions" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libya’s coastguard and co-operation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
“In the last few days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to associate ourselves with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties participated.
The head of the Russian contact group on internal settlement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told “I”, what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you are heading.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
Here's the curtain of mystery.
What specifically do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are curated by the Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The pressure on the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "<0xD0><0x95>").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it turn out that you were the one who led it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We have managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the recognized UN government is based, headed by Faiz Saraj. - "I"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament, which is opposed to the government of Khalifa).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice-Prime Minister of Libya - "I"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular: in Libya, we do not want to associate ourselves with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in power structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAS.
There is no permanent presence in Libya of our staff, there is no need for this yet.
Whether there are Russian military advisers or instructors in Libya right now.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But in your contact group, former military personnel are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed to a certain point for us cities as Misurata (where militias are based, played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were scared, we were told that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are going on, what the role of Islamists really is.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the troops who were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was repelled by militants banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "I").
We wanted to see them, to get to know these people, to check the information that it was they who played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Has not the Islamic State in Libya conquered Haftar?
He didn't do that.
Haftar carried out operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte fought the structures that were subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came – the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Federation Council, in Douma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that were reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will the agreements be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, it was already a good signal that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
Often they write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov" that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Missouri, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You are probably very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are in dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Is it easier to understand with Russian partners on a human, emotional level the fact that he studied in the USSR twice?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He is Russian, if he knows it, he is very relative.
But what he has learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And among other things, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they experience nostalgia for it.
Do you think there is a possibility of an immediate abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we are not taking anyone’s side in this conflict and would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly the same position.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow facilitate its withdrawal.
The process of drafting the constitution is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come up with compromise decisions and that there will be an internal consensus.
Then the elections must be held, which was also discussed at the meeting of Saraja and Haftar.
If the elections are held and a legitimate power is finally elected (and now none of the parties has that status), then it is possible to ask the UN Security Council to remove the arms embargo.
To raise this question now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to escalation of the conflict.
The media reported yesterday that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating out of Libya, feels left to chance by its allies from the EU.
Can Moscow help the Italian partners in this situation by using its ties to the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar’s troops will establish control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is holding a dialogue at the same time with Haftar, and with Saraj, and with Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it to stop the flow of migrants in the south on long-distance approaches?
I mean, by the way, did the buses, which the Nigerian migrants are going to, turn back?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope, however, to contribute to bringing the South together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia norms in the country.
How many radical views does he hold?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be an absolutely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
He is also active in the fight against terrorists.
How did he get such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is, after all, the capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in making sure we didn’t get there.
And we mixed all the cards and started to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil company “Rosneft” took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I think it's a resale.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
The plan is to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the field of transport (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, it is a “oil-for-service” scheme?
I don't know what the plan will be, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not important.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacemaking work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree with each other so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to expel terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to this day there is no exit from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said he has about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. – “I”) and the Russian speech there does not sound.
Which country are these fighters from?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then we formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, no more than 5% of them.
The rest are come.
Can Moscow hold intrusive talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few more visits to be made, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the benefactors collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum-reserve "Melihovo", nine-year-old boy Sasha Macola, who has PTSD, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special running track as a gift on August 5.
A useful presentation is presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosarev and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the training was collected during the charity marathon "Don't Stop Doing Good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on the Day of Memory of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhov district, saying: “I don’t have eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter.”
“I’d really like to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs become strong, and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reservation will take place "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, a well-deserved artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihovo, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert, the bells of the workshop of Ilya Drozdihin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesiny.
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the logo of the marathon were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melihovo" spoke with the initiative to make the Memorial Day of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the Museums of Podmoscow.
The 30-year-old resident of Olevska Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times towards the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was outraged by the noise, reported "FACTAM" in the communication department of the Zhytomyr region police.
After that, the man went into a cafe, located nearby.
In the building, there was a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim is given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene of the incident, but the shooter was hiding by this time.
The law enforcement established his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has a device for firing rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (Huliganization) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have begun.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with a shooting.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Posts That Caused the Suicide of Conrad Roy
The Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to provoke the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to celebrate 15 months of her term on the grid and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unconceived murder of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roya's father said in a hearing on Thursday: "My family was killed in the fire.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy were both suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence by standing up, shaking his hands and lowering his eyes.
“With her actions she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn’t accept responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show mercy."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Justice Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read Roy Lynne Roy’s mother’s statement, saying: “There has never been a day when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
“I want him to be proud of me and how I’m doing — I’m trying to support his sister despite all the pain that will stay with us forever,” he said.
Roy’s sister, Camden Roy, said she was inexorably haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children’s aunts.
“To wipe out the person who has been with me ever since my birth is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he was pushed to the suicide of Carter's message.
“You can hang out, jump off the roof, wrap yourself with a knife, I don’t know there are many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, “You have to do this, Conrad,” and “You just have to turn on the ignition, and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British neighbor in an apartment in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published a special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players in the VTB One League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestiam" was commented by the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision on family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played at UNIX for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, being put on 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the 2015–16 United League.
In the 2016/17 season, he was awarded the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He earned an average of 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004 when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in the history of the EuroLeague to receive the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
It is expected that the American will enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to move to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Yannis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA, the former center of Panathinaikos.
The sun-burnt tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous area of the republic of a sub-Moscow tourist who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the tour group leader, who told them that the man’s fire was received in the march.
Audi plans to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by “Audi” “BMW” said that they would propose to update the software in more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said that the company believes there are “more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, meaning European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that have considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it is modifying three million Mercedes-Benz cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies have called their move a review.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But the nitric oxides that drive out diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also increasing, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also accused it of smothering influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “defeat devices” that during testing could divert the amount of harmful gases that were thrown to comply with the rules, and under normal driving conditions were turned off.
In the United States, the indictment was handed down to several Volksvagen leaders, the rest of which are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
In Germany last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
Former manager Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s revenue.
In Astrakhan, the visitor of the cafe paid false money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank’s office about the discovery in the recalculation of funds received from the point of the general hospital, a suspicious note with a nominal amount of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert-Criminalistic Center found that it was fake.
According to the UMVD of Russia on the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe who bought the shaurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of the banknotes.
Currently, the police are setting up persons involved in the manufacture and sale of the allegedly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful in carrying out financial transactions; it is recommended that the workers of the trade facilities establish tools to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found an “adjacent” planet on which even iron can float
For the first time, studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that the water molecules are so heated by the star's light that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 “Earth” days, and its gas shell is tilted to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now fears are voiced that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse due to dry weather and infectious diseases of insects; this has been the cause of constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant feels the effects of climate change: spring and especially before autumn.
This affects the lifespan of the lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very much.”
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shees says: “Instead of very long rings with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent at all.
That’s why we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solutions that are now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and extracting more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of Winter Universiade-2019 met with schoolchildren from Krasnoyarsk
A two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players the other day and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the Winter Universiade-2019 tent as part of the thematic week dedicated to hockey with chess.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on the horses on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with souvenirs of student games were organized, a break from the federation of aerobics.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to engage in sports as much as possible and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is the hard work and the huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It is a good thing that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a site as the Winter Universiade 2019 tent, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to team coaches," the champion said.
We note that promoting student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Redskins are helped by the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The university tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Department of Winter Universiade-2019.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said it was necessary to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to “enhance bilateral interaction.”
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria a truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, then of course, it has the right to speak, but more on this subject I can say nothing," the State Department spokesman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the government of the Russian Federation Medvedev said that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions would work for decades.
In addition, according to the prime minister, the American establishment “stupidly defeated” Trump.
The missing bodybuilder in Moscow found on another person’s house lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he came out of the car’s salon to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
And Samuel was found in another man's house in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
Dagestan’s athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Establishing a personality helped announcements about his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the phone recorded at Hanmetov a partial loss of memory and a brain injury, reports the Mash ad.
There are other surprises waiting for the athlete as well.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil are likely to have already visited his apartment, the keys from which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, oil and gas revenues obtained as of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The increase, according to the ministry, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble, compared with the average value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and volume of exports.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal Law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is forecast at the amount of +40.2 billion rubles," - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of the purchase of foreign currency will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Russian Ministry of Finance will involve the Bank of Russia in the transaction of foreign currency purchases.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will make transactions for the purchase of foreign currency on the organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The journalist’s murder underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Officials of the weekly newspaper "Riodose" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover up the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war on drugs.
But today, crushed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office, where they had already dropped the grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on a board hanging in a room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column – no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are on the contents of the government or the cartels, a whole list of crooks that make working to light the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give rise to the dead, and among the bodies that multiply in the country, there are more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after the attacks and threats are under the guise of the Feder.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Waldes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence feels very sharp, though his presence everywhere - a large photograph of Valdes showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodose"; two reporters in his 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, funos
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Investigating Journalists was organized in 2010, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated so far.
As is the case with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime murders committed each year, journalists’ killers rarely appear in court.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by the fire, although it is much more dangerous around now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the talks on security at meetings, there is little use,” Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
“As long as we don’t know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelve River".
The gunman went to his car and smashed it in the distance.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly dissipate along the Kuliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the U.S. in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day on Sinaloa streets, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of narcotic kings, which are more than the home of many living people.
Let’s forget for a minute that the state of “rest” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading into the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes knew perfectly well about the dangers of his work, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, Ismail Bohorkes, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who fights with Guzman's sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; the people who were supposed to be members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that had written about the same story was captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was considered another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003 together with five colleagues founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa "it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and the readers were attracted to what in this publication they could read about, which no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for courage in the investigation of drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he told CPJ.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompejento TV.
“You have to take on tasks that rely on you as a journalist – either so or you’re just a fool.”
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodose employees miss Valdes, a joker who cheated like a freighter in the port, a friend, generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get together in the living.
They believed in the order they had set up.
He should always wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Did his love for the once established order destroy him?
His death forced them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you get into their wives, their children, their legal businesses, and underground airfields to transport drugs.
“These things were beyond the damn thing,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Andres Villareal, editor of Riodose, is that “fear can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier is happening.”
The old rules, he and others say, are no longer in effect in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodose employees gathered for security training, cell phones were suddenly banned: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, were used in Mexico for surveillance by journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers hide in the shade of a 104-degree heat tree (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the office of "Riodose", which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some journalists have asked half-heartedly whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers that the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which in fact is under the control of a gang of drug traffickers.
In the nearest room, "Riodose" was designed for three main themes.
This is the murder of Sinaloa brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, in the neighborhood from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of power for almost a century.
Recently, several governors of the PRI have been accused of corruption in the past.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman's son El Chapo slipped off the military's roof.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for a column of Valdes with the most reliable information about the abduction.
“We’d already known what happened before,” says 46-year-old Villareal, for his bodybuilding called El Flaco.
“Today all the channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
The Waldesian cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdes was killed.
They found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to enlist international support in the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for what they are telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her more tasks to light up the Government's activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, its accomplices in government, and indifference to society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are doing so at the orders of politicians and security services who are in conflict with organized crime.
The Committee for the Protection of the Press “Article 19” believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on orders of police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you down,” Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez says.
Of course, killings threaten people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written on the face of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications have preferred to close as the newspaper “El Norte” in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be held as "El Manjana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez made a public appeal to drug cartels using a front-page editorial entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or the country in general.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and they continue to face danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as this apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was ready for print, the Riodos publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones suddenly called at the same time.
A series of shootings between anti-combating gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind 19 bodies, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to burn, as was promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via mobile phone on the website "Riodose".
The next day, I had to rewrite the first page.
Sirens were picked up nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked at whether they were ready to defend their police officers.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole Sinaloa, employees of Riodos continued his work.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although it is terrifying.
The researchers said the first remnants of an incredible rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it “My Lizard among the Dinosaurs.”
It survived so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his curly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-preserved in the history of discoveries and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world.”
This fossil is a recently found specimen of nodozavra, which lived in the middle of the milling period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition stunned the researchers, who called him “really wonderful.”
This herbaceous tyreophore is the most well-preserved fossil of this species in the history of finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fancom when he was working at Sancor's Millenium near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The excavator he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirrell Museum of Paleontology.
Over the next six years, work was carried out on the discovery of an animal within the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s just worth a little bit of a squeeze, and you can almost believe that he’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved copies of the dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered in armor and resembled a walking tank, apparently being subjected to considerable danger by the densely-fed dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique known as a protective paint, which is also used by many animals these days.
This would allow him to merge with the environment more quickly and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature belonging to the nodosaurus family was widely illuminated in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopetta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory of Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group, who spent more than 7,000 hours for its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the shape and shape of the cheekbones and armor plates on his body.
They discovered a protective paint, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than the bottom of it.
Although the protective paint is well-spreaded, the discovery was a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur significantly exceeds the size of the now-living animals with a protective paint.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by ferocious dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective paint – for example, deer, zebras or armored vehicles – are much smaller in size and are more affordable prey, which indicates that the nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel period were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Czech dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the content of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was brought into the sea, where it sank and lay its back down on the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far deeper into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved combed skin, and at the same time it has been fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Mel period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just need to squeeze it a little bit, and you can almost believe that he’s sleeping.”
The Melt Period is an era when giant theropods, flat-footed dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, on the tyreofora could hunt some of his terrible ancestors.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5 meters) monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopenta was introduced to the sea after death and mummified in the ileum.
The creature was found by Sean Fancom when he was working at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum officials, it is the best-preserved tyreophor in the world, along with the skin and the pancreas, and it is the target, from the marrow to the ribs.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophor was hard on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen have survived so well that the remains of the skin still cover the buggy armor plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Mikhail Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of safety is “rare as winning a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin are still covered by the burgundy armor plates, insuring the animal's skull.
His right front leg is pulled along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the cherries on his floor.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at the event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to speak this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topics of Georgia’s cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived his citizenship, the drunk politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly did he manage to make a transatlantic flight without documents, as yet unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was faked.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation into the case of Weinzicher and Olhovyk has been extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renov" Yevgeny Olkhovic and the head of energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinziher was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman court is considering the extension of the indicted domestic arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision last time to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to extract and carry out an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conducting investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of JSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vympelkom", handed over to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribes for the installation and maximum
Weinzicher and Olhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was declared in federal search.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Whose street?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, the native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She was standing in front of someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he’s still in the middle of the street.”
Paying attention to the fact that no one else on her tape had posted this information, puzzled, she shut down Facebook and opened a Twitter.
In her tape there were many user interceptions with Nick <0x40>TheePharoah.
The rapper from Greater St. Louis in real-time tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, spread out among the streets where it will be four hours.
"It's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering at the Kenfield Drive.
There were photos of the tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown’s father, the state poster with the words: “A Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, picked up a bunch of rifles and shouted, “I’ll kill all of you... animals!”
“This is an unusual situation,” Ferrell said, according to her own memories.
“It’s not a murder like the ones we’re used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a sense of shame.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years has become the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was traveling to Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they recalled a conversation that had been conducted countless times before this morning, “about the experience of black people and their situation.”
She recalls, as she said, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We’re going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and grow up on it.
It must not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situations and what we must do to become free in order to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she personally does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had prevented her from doing so.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, on a site located across the road from a police station that became something like a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the officer's final innocence.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur, who prepared the lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
A little in the mind Ferrel took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and environmental inequality.
“I didn’t have the experience of an organizer.
It came on its own.”
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of his directors.
Folayan said she and her main operator Lucas <0xC3><0x81>lvarado-Ferrer “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism has been driven by numerous people, often white, who have come to the community in order to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan has already teamed up with his director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the issues of the death penalty.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the project team “Whose Streets?” maintained contact during the years since Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, that’s what we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because that’s how I’ll be represented myself.”
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the rescuer leader, but about how the community unites,” as Folayan said – it proved to be the most open-minded of the film’s participants.
The result in Whose Streets? shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at the way I saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel’s story again discusses and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the 2012 murder of Black teen Trayvon Martin — attributed themselves to homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” says Ferrell, “and it’s all because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all of this burden.”
Folayan agreed with the statement, noting that "the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and a lot of gay black women."
However, she insists that "it's not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not selected as the central character of the film due to its distinctive features.
“She was the one who woke up this energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it was in the foreground because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, there are no cinema cameras for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for the closure of the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which he calls home, simply: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she walked into Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for bite of U.S. players
Salvadoran footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have received long-standing disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup confederations of North and Central America and the countries of the Caribbean (CONCACAF) the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the assailant Josi Altidoro, and then stabbed him in the chest.
Then the midfielder Seren, when submitting the corner in his penalty area, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Seren was disqualified for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, Goal.com reports.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, everything is inextricably similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from combs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent a clip from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama softened the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing with the help of a computer program the DNA obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have had such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy to perceive, indignity manifest, dedicated
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but from a young age openly said she considers herself a woman, in 2013 she was convicted on 20 episodes, including six violations of the Act of Espionage, Computer Fraud and Stealing.
Her photographs in prison were unavailable, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum-toned wig, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the wheel of the car; with this photo, she and the asso.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence of the type of cucumbers and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey Haagborg explained at a preview of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her sitting in the prison muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of comics, "Images Made", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which described how in the future the president will mitigate Chelsea's punishment and will be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump announces war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to incite in Twitter the hostility he has been calling for.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In a statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning’s huge signature below (with a heart instead of an “i” point in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long muzzle made of a pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist expresses scientifically exquisitely), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we are all surprisingly similar, in any case in our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn’t determine who we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is,” said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work “Fake Memories” is also on display.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories here.”
The last part of the exhibition, placed in one room, is the aforementioned novel in the comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the U.S. Correctional barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“Therefore, never be silent.”
“This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, welcoming us from Philadelphia.
“I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was vividly depicted in the comics – but when it comes, she will be greeted by the masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulators gathered, like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as all in the exhibition up to the height (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>2, the height of Manning), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood for its liberation.”
A professor at the North-West University and an employee of the University of Oxford are looking for a policeman on charges of murder
According to police, there is a nationwide complaint against a professor at the North West University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being investigated as being suspected of having been found dead in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court’s protocols, on Monday orders were issued to arrest for premeditated murder without the right to be released under the auspices of forty-two-year-old Windem Latham and fifty-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged death.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after multiple knee injuries.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several injuries on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, considering it a murder, while police are heavily searching for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbadj, vice president of the University of Communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was forbidden from entering the campuses of the North-West University.
"Now it is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North-West University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbadj said.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative bodies.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were in shock and wanted him to resign.
The head of the Chicago Police Department’s communications department, Anthony Guelmi, said he strongly advises the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have some clues as to where they are, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the policeman was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened at number 1008.
The police called the scene of the crime terrible.
Gulelmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim have been linked," Gulelmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued a call to residents, in which it was reported: “At the moment the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be met in the near future.
“A certain stage in meeting the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The VADA road map has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition "Rsport" Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
Absolutely no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
VADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of VADA, Olivier Nigly, stated that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.

All the residents were evacuated on time.
Inconceivable outfit Buzo shock fans: pants that do not cover panties
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzov impressed the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live with dances in panties.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly revealed singer duet with Nastya Kudry performed the song "We'll Be Hot".
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "shorts", sewn in such a way that the lower underwear of the singers turned out to be on the face.
Buzova and Kudry were printed on the pants.
Earlier it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzovaya was commented on by a specialist of one of Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg admits worsening relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO general also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the U.S. and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the U.S. Congress of doing so.
The Yekaterinburg Metro is gaining a new way of payment
In October, the trip to the Yekaterinburg Metro will be possible to pay by bank card, said the General Director of JSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the Regional newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for the subway ride as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the world, to be able to take advantage of the metropolis by using their bank cards without buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups That Will Help Your Company Not Become Another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among employees of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, dishonest.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, managing director of a San Francisco-based company of 75 Madison Reeds, which deals with e-commerce in the field of hair care.
Therefore, she turned to third parties for help.
There is now a new kind of start-ups in the field of working with staff that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is the measurement of employee involvement, they allow companies to make express inquiries, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases, to allow complaints.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City startup, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure engagement.
Errett said she had gained a greater understanding of what her employees thought and felt over the three years of using “Glint.”
In addition to express surveys and surveys of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form, which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows them to understand why.
Companies are little aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Uber, which turned out to be involved in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post in which he described an aggressive situation that did not go away.
For startups like Glint, it’s a desire to control the situation – an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment” dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based startup, Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently “Uber” appeared among customers.
Like “Glint”, “Convertent” allows companies to send custom-made opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view heat maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if they touch the top manager, the complaints go straight to the direction.
“The public opinion court seized power from inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company treats employees poorly or behaves unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convertent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or an email from the head office, file an official complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, chief legal officer of Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employees’ complaints.
Now that the company is using the “Convertent” service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay — can be quickly detected and dealt with.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network’s risk management group.
“And we’re protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinland, the companies began to take ethics, values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen suffered a breakdown due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron case.
But only when “social networks got mass distribution,” companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the network.
“Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both “Glint” and “Convercent” offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received approval from venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, “Convercent” received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which resulted in the company’s total capital reaching $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company’s total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than it was before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects – this is just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they hear them, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at Inverlin.
Investors earn income when business from their portfolio goes well; business from companies goes well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s not surprising that they find support.
As the culture experts at the workplace say, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's custodians take action.
In fact, if the company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes don’t come fast enough, or don’t come at all, disappointment can develop, and employees lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be prepared to hold 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rat, president of consulting at Kotter International, a management firm that had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, employees will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't mind?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, the Madison Reed company, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day someone reports a problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to retain more effectively employees in the industry, known for its high personnel turnover.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul opens a new asphalt on the prospectus of the Red Army
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt failure on the prospectus of the Red Army.
The place where the pits on the recently asphalted part of the driveway (a intersection with the street Youth), is decided to "open".
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramway was due to the fact that the land in the area of the landless unexploited network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Administration, Public Works, Transport and Communications Ivan Garmat, a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will be carried out.
Depending on the outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the plumbing of unhoused communications and their concreteization.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has canceled the training twice a day.
Time is nearing eleven o'clock in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, is delayed to negotiate on one side the team's new training grounds located on campus.
Some of them stretched their t-shirts, revealing their backs shining from sweat after a tense first day of a sports camp.
For many players on the team, these minutes of inaction are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes, after three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Vasserman football center at the meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, team coach Jim Moore said, “In the next three days these guys are waiting for a meatball.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the load for players, actually lengthened their working day – at least until the exams were completed on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the University of California at Los Angeles team was scheduled at 7:15 p.m. so that they would fit in and without the tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two workouts a day was greater than the number of days with one workout, and Bryant moves the beginning of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training sessions by August 20, including before starting official preparation for the first game of the season against the Texas A&M University team in September.
Mora said he supports the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that due to him, another point appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“Within three or four days we give them this huge load, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just beat him, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring "Laskin Center", an expensive football hotel, which is already under construction.
Players from the Brewings must occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, a problem may arise.
“We’ll have security,” Morra said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I don’t exaggerate the danger, assuming that someone can take a room, sit there and record training on video.
If you have a training video, this is very serious.
But we'll have security there and security at the parking lot number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All those affected by the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All those who were injured in the St. Petersburg metro attack in April were discharged from the hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in the stations, reports TV Center.
Recall, the explosion in the St. Petersburg metropolitan area occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by terrorist-killer Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abor Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, the day before Rospotrebnadzor recommended to the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystifications, independent experts, and show their findings under the original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly show the results of the fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections announced that they would support a plan to punish social networks if they did not run out of time.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make sound judgements about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s newsfeed manager, wrote in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the feature of “related articles” and work on other changes to the news feed to solve the fake news issue.
Create a novel-comics: A Castle in English History
In the recent past, Scottney's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a port for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Bayle River valley in Kent County he observed a turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a land-haired and historical record, to a novel-comic.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Equarian era and tells of the families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Brian May Smith, William Eckley, and William Eckley.
It’s not Rods’ first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote “The Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories” – a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly shook him to the core.
“I could have just scratched my finger at the end of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked on the Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell smoke, because in those times for lighting were on fire.
And in 300 years, in the future, you seem to be there too.
"I love the archives!"
For a person who is so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Artistic Council and living in the castle for four months (“Honestly, I’m a little bit stuck there”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle for days, walked through the archives, and looked at numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of the genie on the walls or bottles, centuries in ruins.
He was walking through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Later that night, he drank whiskey and sat down to write.
The history of Scott's castle is not much studied because the National Fund gained full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff only began to deal with the archive, which he described as “what the aristocrats had thrown into the limelight for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think the land disputes are boring,” says Rods, “but there were two families fighting for this birch.
That's it, guys!"
In some of the stories of the castle collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in the "Laboratory", the hero departs from the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called ‘The Knights of Kent and Sussex’,” Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were related?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funerals by pounding the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years after the tomb was excavated).
Darrells is a favorite of the Rhodes family of all who settled in Scotty: “Gentlemen seem to have been the perfect villain, forever in debt and spent money on what they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, the Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women – I imagine them as a company of nice guys who can take care of the heirs of great estates.”
After finishing his job at the castle, Rods is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish Highlands, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamianmyaka - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again.”
The 15 largest banks choose “Russia” <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK "Opening", another seven credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 percent of the market will be accounted for by the ARB.
But this is not just a way out - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB, conduct negotiations with another public institution, uniting credit institutions, - the Association of regional banks "Russia", headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, the market leader of the Finance Committee of the Republic of Poseidon
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the charter capital.
At the time, Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that according to the association, this bill is being adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many managers of the spent banks, in particular, in the street.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in acrimonious conduct to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, expressing disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for the entry of acrimony in the association "Ufe, Russia",
Investors will be better.
How's it gonna end?
Let us answer immediately the main question that arises in the case of the smallest failure or conflict in the banking sphere or next to it: nothing threatens the depositors, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Headed by "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his valuation in everything regarding the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, which is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the event
On a personnel-organizational level, obviously, there will also be no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB is in a difficult financial-management situation after the absence of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest organization, established in 1991, an organization that upholds the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the field of money-loaning as a whole.
It can not be said that in the association "Russia" with the spread of arms, the money is ready to accept on any conditions of new members, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatoliy Aksakov ("may, too much will") that the press statement, which was made on July 21 at the press conference
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary association congress is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll find out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair is not held", called the possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgiy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of the Vice-President of the Central Bank, highly characterized and de-characterized.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt the holiday for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary meeting "Russia".
The entry of cars with a petrol engine into major cities of Russia will not be restricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major Russian cities will not yet be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
This is where the concept of zero-emissions comes into play.
I don’t think we’re technically ready for that.
The question is, what year?
It's the same at the slogan level of the phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole city?
“In 20 years, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” Prime said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovych was instructed to study proposals on possible options for the state support of electric transport, presented to the government by the Director General of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with SUVs in large cities and in resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, according to which the rules for getting a green card would change.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing schema.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own English, have the money resources that allow them to hold on to themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to the US media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us.
We failed to think that 2017 can no longer get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots was released.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the center of attention.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are horrifying about this, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more,” Sharkey said in a presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inspirational counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to feel, and almost human replicas, which are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the eye color and shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Woman would appear to be very progressive is worrying even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to customize in robots the quality they find attractive, - for example, shyness.
There are also sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farra" makes an impression of shady, and "Dike Wendy" has a "brave" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours,” the True Companion website said.
That’s why she loves what you love, doesn’t love what you don’t love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, just like the real person!
She may want to sleep or gossip, or she may “be in the mood”!
In the emergence of sex robots, a lot of worries - not least because they replace real human relationships, - but most of all worries the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which provokes the domination of the Cold.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy are compared with a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is brought to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these complex sex robots emerged precisely when women’s rights around the world were at risk when a president in the White House is proud of what happens to women.
The most terrifying thing in the TV series "The Story of the Maid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and depressed eyes, but precisely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so great.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of pornstars), as technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like humans to feel like they are copying the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely their "characters" that robots are not like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or get away from them.
They have neither their lives nor their biographies – nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
A Los Angeles native Yujin (Pukh) Jeter, who has been representing Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket portal by the general manager of the "yellow-blue" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he won't come under family circumstances.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Recall: with the direct participation of Jeter, the team of Ukraine took the record for sixth place at Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time got to the World Championship on basketball, in which the "yellow-blue" failed to overcome the group stage, and a native of the United States won 15 games.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving as head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
The Men's EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on the promised land.
Eugenia Murzin will have five matches in Group B: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they surrendered to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's big move?
Imagining the myth of Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate, at a micro level, broke down some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers were stockpiled with columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're going to steal soon.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago, who had long been on knives with Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
At Trump’s White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she’s been discussing politics with for decades, suddenly and strangely turned out to be on one side.
After dinner it’s certainly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has inhaled forces into the left flank, but the distorting effect of his administration can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being impressed by his exits.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly turn out to be a model of common sense.
I realized that I really miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like) - compared to Trump and that, and that's not very much like that.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park — the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are ugly and huge, the pictures of the fiberglass on the central drum - the grizzling clowns and animals, who, bending over, in horror look at themselves on their back, - are extremely creepy, and the ringing music, oddly enough, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings have come too far to cause a stir, and the reality of the city does not succeed behind the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss-cottage area is actually not a Swiss shawl (thematic pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” is not an account), but a large round cross in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a 11-year-old child and two women in their 40s can have a great time.
If I could make a carousel assessment, I would make a five, but fortunately no one asked me to.
And this week at the Univermage, I was asked before taking a card to the terminal to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street still the same plus the option to accompany the rating of tea in 15 percent - it's for an order at the stand.
As a result, it not only slows down the idea of a neutral interaction, but also has to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller in the univermage smirked, as I was tired of appreciating my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving the prison because of a visit to the doctor already for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for the initial sentence for an unconceived murder.
He killed Stonencamp early in the morning on Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he accepted his friend for a night thief who was hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office said it intends to hold another protest, this time against Pretoria’s six-year term, which, she said, is too soft.
The Prosecutor General’s Office said it would file an appeal with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of the Pretoria can be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor’s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV selected the signature on the non-departure
The city’s law enforcement officials chose the interception measure in the form of a non-departure signature for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Iryna Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case brought under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battles") against a 32-year-old man who hit on the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of culture and recreation of the name of Gorky, the arrest of the suspect was not carried out.
A representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol has been drawn up with respect to the suspect for non-compliance with the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast on the VDV Day, an unsuspecting man approached the correspondent and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VDV.
According to Razvozhayev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovites.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
According to the Bi-Ti-Vi TV channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sithonia, putting tents in an unlocated place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel “Bi-Ti-Vi” that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught while parking in a place not intended for this purpose.
Tests will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry accuses U.S. Vice President of rhetoric during the Cold War
Statements made during the European tour of U.S. Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly plunged into the primitive ideological imprints of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry responded to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly cross the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West or with Russia” and the inevitability of the thesis about the alleged inalienable entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law, using force to expel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another stagnation of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop shelling Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for its partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldscher injured in DTP with "soon" in Moscow
DTP occurred in the Moscow-based Stupino, as a result of the collision of the foreign trade mark with the cart "Emergency Assistance" was affected by the feldsher.
Today at about 08:10 a.m. there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with a ambulance in the city of Stupino in the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the machine "soon" turned," - said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Moscow region.
On the site of the DTP, employees of law enforcement agencies work, the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on the scaffold, turning into a cellophane package.
On the evening of August 3, the police department received a message from the local resident that he had found a package with the baby in an incomplete private house.
“At the scene of the incident, the law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly delivered the child to a medical facility left,” the head of the National Police in Odessa said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
During the first-ever operational and consequential events, the identity of the newborn is established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also found that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement, the family did not previously fall and did not take special account.
The police are currently determining the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her unborn child into a garbage can.
Grigory Leps: "I'm in a fight, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the observer "Izvesty".
I remember your "half-sister" remark.
A special tent in the "Luzniky", Gloria Gaynor sang for the nominator, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I'm sure you'd have guessed how you'd like to spend your next five years.
The plans have come true?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, travelled three times with tours all over the country, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two very good albums.
Of course, now I am not what, let’s say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks are not to be fooled.
Singing the way I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm in a fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm on a different level.
With them, you're recording a new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him right now.
Actually, we've all recorded it in my studio, and now we're sending it to a Los Angeles briefing.
It's called "You're So Serious?" by a song of the same name that was written together with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record is hand-stitched by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to bring him into your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio and recorded his plays.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 thousand to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer Max Malishev.
It is better to feed your own (smiling).
Sometimes I want to get in touch with one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came along with another performing technique."
Your album is coming down in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that have always been decided by American musicians have not been fulfilled at all.
They strive for the highest quality sound possible.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the United Kingdom has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa every year at the British Embassy to be allowed to go there again, and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And already in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good gym in Monte Carlo, I've been there before.
Now they have been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
On "Randevo Laima Vaikule", which will start July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, replied.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a great woman, able to present herself both with a beautiful vocal, and even with a whisper.
After the tours and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Vysotsky’s work.
You already have two albums of his songs on your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same format as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement at all.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how he gets along.
You and Boris Grebenschikov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: can I sing one or another of his songs?
He said, “Grigorius, I write songs so that they can be performed.”
Please try it, sing it.
It’s also interesting to record such an album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may do such a project.
If you don’t focus entirely on the business of your production center.
I guess until you realized his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the Voice.
We signed a contract with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a real shame if it does not reach the heights it deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm shooting clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
Upon release, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And further, if they will, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them would be commercially successful and pay me the interest we agreed to in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove what I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
It is mainly about closed-ended activities.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my own country, a Russian, by my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane, which then crashed.
If they say tomorrow that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that such a situation has happened with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before that, I gave 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and it is truly regrettable that now they cannot fully showcase their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would like to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slavu Vakarchuk, and have a concert with him.
But I think at the moment it's unlikely...
Andrei Okhlopkov transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "<0xD0><0x95>", the technical director of the cosmodrome East Andrey Ohlopkov started to work at the State Space Science and Production Center (CSO) named Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de-facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI) he was transferred to an enterprise in the Moscow Phillies, where he will undertake the coordination of production.
The reducer at Mr. Okhlopkov will not be: the post of technical director, most likely, will be abolished, and the functionality will be discarded according to the units of CENKI.
About the fact that the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director General of the Centre for Technological Development Andrei Ohlopkov moved to work at the Khrunichev National Institute of Technology, "I" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as employees of the governments of the space industry.
"He's been working on a new position for several weeks," the "I" interlocutors in the industry said.
It was not possible to receive an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "E" was officially confirmed in the CCPC.
He made the decision to move to the position of Director of Production Coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Ohlopkov set before him the task of ensuring a minimum launch for the first launch on the Eastern spaceport fully fulfilled.
Mr. Ohklopkov went to work at the CIA in 2013, having a service in the space forces, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - on the "north" cosmodrome occupied the position of the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a criminal case figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his submission, the regional merchants received for the rejection of the state order, but did not comply with the obligations to remove the separate parts of the carrier missiles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities assigned to it in the CENKI for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the structure of the Cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then-head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with I, said directly that the situation in the East "was critical as early as October 2013".
The fact is that when planning was made a strategic mistake: the completion of the structure and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To complete the launch by the end of the year, the system was decided six months earlier and the deadlines were set from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, we had to go to the trick: the specialists of the CENKI began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment on non-manufactured objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015 the "Soyuz" flew only on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "I" on the spaceport: "Otherwise we would not have carried out any launch from the East, a
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who curated the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Ohlopkov his "cosmic Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the course of the structure.
Remembered Mr. Okhlopkov and straight: for example, in an interview with "E", he offered to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetstroy) of the status of the sole contractor for the East and directly to work with subcontractors: "Why should we always pay to the subcontractors?
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of the general contractor in order to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex planned for the fourth quarter of the launches.
According to "E", the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov's transition to the new place of work was disagreements with the CENKI leadership on the ways of completing the structure of the structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with sub-order organizations.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to "E" data, this will not be required: the position of the technical director of the spaceport will be abolished and its functions will be dissolved according to the units of CENKI.
In music schools will appear a program of study for two specialties
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this, students can be reassigned repeating disciplines, and the issue with the payment of other classes on the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we will, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday during Vladimir Putin’s “Nedet Talk” with the pupils of the “Sirius” children’s center, the student Maria Andreev said that she was forced to pay for recurring items on the second specialty in the Central Committee at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano in class and has prizes of contests in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was arrested on a wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., was detained, who climbed the roof of a high-rise building on the wall, according to the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-meter fence into Nestle’s office building complex and took himself to one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It is there to find out if the juvenile is legally located in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man climbing to the heights became popular on the Web.
The users called the young man a “shoe man.”
As the media reports, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease the pain.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies say the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help ease the symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and abdominal swelling, chronic or bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to relieve symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the gut are monitoring that harmful microbes that come with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protect the body and at the same time do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too strongly broken in the direction of inflammation, this can lead to inflammatory diseases of the intestine.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the gut appear to have an increased cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in mice, the more these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone environment in the gut.
A postdoc by Dr. Luisa Servantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of immune cell-enhancing tolerances, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but contained them separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mouse gut microbiomes — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse gut cell DNA was sequenced and six types of bacteria were found to be present in mice that have immune cells but are absent in mice that do not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid — without bacteria — to the underdeveloped immune cells isolated from the mice.
Immune cells have been converted into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of processing tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were reduced by twice, the number of cells also fell by twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barrag<0xC3><0xA1>n explains that people have the same increased cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found.
She says: “Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
“High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired "genius" in the face of Nemanya Matich
Manchester United have hired “geniuses” in the face of Nemanya Matic, Jose Mourinho said after the midfielder made his debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, acquired for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression in the role of Anjou in the match.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires improvements before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in how he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romela Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to form his main squad by the start of the following season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I am grateful to the club for winning three of the four,” he added.
“I’m even more excited if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of Lithuania’s Social-Democrats agree to remain in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkivicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats Cheslavas Jursenas, appealed to the one-party with the call to stay on the right.
As the Parliamentary newspaper reported, due to frictions with partners - the Union of Farmers and "Greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here three senior experienced comrades addressed to the one-party government with an open letter to the prime minister, in which, in particular, the saying: "The disappointment of our comrades in the party by the results of the elections, however, the coalition with the "farmers" created for us, not a very easy life, but still a condition for
According to former party leaders, in the discussion so far “the emotion-based expression of opinion has been mastered without specific arguments.”
The authors of the letter fear that their party’s reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev has been fined.
The Moscow court reduced the punishment of wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky Court, the convicted person was released from SISO.
At the same time, the Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorist from a former special forces fighter.
By its decision, the Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. of the fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," - said the I press secretary of the Moscow court Ulyan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account Mamaev's state of health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a penalty can be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to the assistant of Mamaev, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for a change in the severity of the offence and a change in sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow court.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appeals in the Moscow Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
The 28-year-old Moskvich Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal case figure in the fall of last year.
Invalid claims that he bought a scooter from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles. to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including the former special forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov had taken ownership of them, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment with imprisonment in the colony of the general regime (art. 2 of Art. 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in SISO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, was connected to the case under President Tatiana Moskalkov.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from SISO by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Moscow.
NFB prepares report on environment for president
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian People’s Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, told “Izvestia” a source in the ONF and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "frontoviki" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvesty’s interlocutors at the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvesty", the final forum of the ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key UFO events.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will formulate systemic proposals to solve environmental problems," said Izvestiam, an interlocutor at the ONF.
The co-chairman of the Central headquarters of the movement Olga Timofeev, the head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontoviki” will submit to the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Forum of Action” of the ONF are likely to be co-ordinated.
Over the year, we grew up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental issues, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontoviki" also report on work on priority projects of the ONF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeev.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the Mediaforum of the NFB, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Tymofeev.
Andrei Kolyadin, head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI) noted: raising environmental issues, the ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered on various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president," Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestiam.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashiche (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Nachodka (a draft law on the ban on the open transfer of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeev).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia in general is created, the question consists in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions made by the state is necessary - considers the head of the charity "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin.
Sergey Tsiplenkov, head of the non-governmental organization “Greenpeace of Russia” in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business, some legislative efforts, is necessary to successfully solve environmental problems.
As soon as they realize in society and business that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,” said Sergey Tsiplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to break the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car by waving his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even plant a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has lived a tiny chip between big and pointed fingers and now through his company BioTech offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal Hospital in Winchester, ensuring that the intake procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that feeds cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The company also replaces locks in homes and cars for compatible with the chip at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which is built when his hand is on the wheel.
The property for the White House was paid to taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to force a helicopter of the Marines to the South Pole at an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One” when the president is on board, became the central element of the July 17 event at the White House, which showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have examined technology products from all 50 states, according to the report.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Mann State, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the ground.
“I just wanted you to make sure you’re aware because it’s an unusually widely-lit event in the press,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his boss, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the mero.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the event scheduled for 3 a.m., and would remain there before the lawn would be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it remained unclear whether a second crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event does not contravene this regulation.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told it was not,” the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to care," replied the deputy chief.
The event "Made in America" was declared by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even the official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health reform, which was then under development in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
The presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking them only in the interests of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane was in the background during his first pre-election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was loaded with complaints about the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and on the South Loop to train the President of the United States’ transportation to the White House with accuracy to the inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training positions at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight, carried out for the event "Made in America", was counted to the crew in the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours on that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not incur any expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Luzhayak.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Ministry of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Defense Ministry’s compensation rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airbase at the air base of the Quantiko Marines in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“To calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, maintenance, and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of the personal composition, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of the use of a helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things that have been done in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we’re all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump had interacted with the helicopter, looking at the South Pole during the event, but he was definitely sitting at the driver’s seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representatives, joking with the press about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will award grants for resuscitation offices of urban hospitals
Annually, grants "Saving Life" will be awarded to resuscitations and departments of intensive therapy of capital clinics.
The funds are made to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the examination of the clinic, he gave a thank you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedic doctor Viktor Protsko, under whose guidance the most difficult operation on reconstruction of the foot of the adolescent was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also told about the decision to allocate annually to resuscitations and intensive care departments of the grant city clinics.
The funds will go towards the encouragement of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, the clinical hospital named Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomenska Rural Hospital.
Currently, the department of the medical institution is designed for the reception of more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the resuscitation and the parking lot, there are day offices here.
The number of hospital staff is 2,800.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term care workers (SKP).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the periods of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized in a clinical hospital named Yudin.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported on the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, with reference to a representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni to agree on a brokered (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares is cancelled.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in the NBU have not been received," the statement said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew the request for the purchase of Sberbank’s subsidiary structure.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Sayd Gutseryev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification on the subject of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to the consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceryev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceryev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.
Trailer of the third season of Narco: in the popular series of the studio "Netflix" after the death of Pablo Escobar the central role is played by the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that in the second season of Narco, the identity of the killer Pablo Escobar was revealed, the series of Netflix studios is far from over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented by the first trailer, demonstrating the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the attention of the Drug Control Agency attracted the richest organization of drug traffickers - the Kali cartel.
The organization, led by powerful fathers of the cross, operates as a Fortune 500 corporation, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The leader of the cartels – Hilberto Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Orechuel (Damian Alkasar), Miguel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Orechuel (Francisco Denis) – her brain, Pacho Errera (Alberto Ammann) is responsible for relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz-London (Pepe Rapa) works.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to the role of Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character who, on his part, attracts American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war on drugs.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overstated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The election can only be fully representative when women are fully involved in it and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to the provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban movement threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s election, power for the first time passes peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

Electricity is cheaper for both the residents and for the producers of goods of Buryatia
For more than a decade, the efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial receivers is reduced by 25%.
Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have beaten the thresholds of Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs from the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main watershed for the territory.
Only this year did the moves begin.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles./kWh to 3.93 rubles./kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Buryatia on the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the operation of wholesale and retail markets are established, arose among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt-hour.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements in the direction of the downturn for the Buryatia.

The National Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Cattle Workers (GMB) is concerned about capital investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the cookie maker McVitie's in connection with its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent about the issue of future investments in the facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, says it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "know about them first".
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie’s reaction to the concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize the production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffey said: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish production at McVitie’s factory.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The head of the facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our continued cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB employees and representatives, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We’ve talked to employees about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we’re constantly re-evaluating our actions – and this applies to all of our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“Over the past few years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that on the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Oil and Chemical Company (VNHC) should connect the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the disputes.
The Head of State pointed out that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK jeopardizes the implementation period of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources,” Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow her to use gas from the Kirin field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petroleum Company.
In June, Gazprom said talks on the issue were continuing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s transition three years ago?
La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona of setting a world record for the three-year-old attack?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window, when League 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than twice as high as the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 minutes.
When the transition ends, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week clean.
It is known that "Barcelona" is angry at how the offer was made, and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's leadership, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from "C."
But wasn’t the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaze Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to beat one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they beat one of our players, then we’ll stand up to them, we’ll make suggestions to their players,” he said.
“We are very respectful of all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in midfielder Marco Verratti from PSG.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player of the team under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin ordered to deal with the payments suffered by forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered to understand the material assistance, which stands out to the people affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.

“In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money is allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyailo and the head of the Baykal branch of the FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on the lake cleaning.
Then we showed the kittens in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few boys from the bag.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to Minstroy, one volume is needed, and allegedly another volume is provided.
"I want to understand with this that, in fact, there is a financing going on there," the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that during the 2017 forest fires, the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region were covered by fire, residential houses and economic buildings were destroyed.
