Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo for 26 hours to win the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and check will be awarded, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with five committee members, who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then has a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony to which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghan war in the resumption of the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is taking over the prize as president, who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, the war effort increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but you haven't decided on a specific charity yet.
The loaded program will then lead the president with a walk to the banquet, where in addition to the Norwegian King and Queen will also be the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the very beginning, Obama was more modest in price.
He said, for example, that he felt he didn’t fully deserve it.
Several times he also reiterated that it is not just about the price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Nature’s Guardians Accused of Extortion
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civil association of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Conservationists of the Republic of Lithuania of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Lithuanian police spokesman.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka is the chairman of the Litomeric Society of Nature Conservation.
He's in prison now, and he's in jail for up to three years.
The sorting containers of Brno do not smell very much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the containers from drinks, and in the South Moravian villages you will find sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
Stay there for a few minutes before you find the right ashtray.
I do not want to say that there is no waste in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that because we are the second largest city in the republic, the councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting lye not only by the fact that as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all the number of ashes for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into a collection basket in the center?
It's a finished mushroom, mainly it takes time and solid nerves.
The only place I have ever met is on Moravian Square opposite Potreffen<0xC3><0xA1> Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka get mad at me and his colleagues, but I don't get a damn good deal of it.
Not to mention that in other parts, there is no classification of waste honey.
A lot of my friends don't like waste.
From the laziness.
They have a long way to the ashtrays.
I'm not surprised.
After the party, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ashtrays on Kounicova street in the surveillance room.
Fortunately, I found the right place on my way to the sidewalk.
However, the waste came out of it.
After all, it’s still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city the most, isn’t it?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are not very interesting.
Those of the city would rather buy a hockey extraliga, which would embarrass us all over the republic, than buy a few more containers and offer a sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that after a while of browsing the internet, I was able to confirm my opinion with official statistics.
According to EKO-COM, Brno is the worst in the whole of the South Moravian region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money on pensions and sickness
After the left has added to the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, it may not be in the budget money for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also for interest on state debt or on international court disputes.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists promoted the increase to certain groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick government to borrow extra money. “It’s just putting the problems into the future, putting the mines on,” says Janota.
For the money borrowed is paid more and more interest, and sometimes it has to be returned.
There's not much to choose from, there's no state.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, it must raise taxes.
To all that the left has now added: to the firemen, to the teachers, to the farmers.
And later their children too.
About pensions or sickness, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to worry, they will get them.
But at the cost of more debt – next year there will be no more than 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more and more quickly and with it the costs of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT or reduce maternally, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As a result of the money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, there will also be five billion for the construction of highways and railways next year.
These are, in large part, already prefabricated and disassembled sections, which cannot be redesigned or discounted.
At the very least conserve, which is also not free.
This means a delay or a halt to thirty large buildings, and European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed that the loss of money will solve the slump – it will go to the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state owns mostly, and from them the transport fund will contribute.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a safe source.
Last year, the Czech Republic had a budget of $18 billion.
Annually, the dividend is paid for the liquidation of environmental damage, a pension account is added to it or serves as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival.
Almost three billion people died in the budget for various damages to victims of communism and criminal acts, or for spending on litigation, even on construction savings.
If it goes without that money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay for it the same way, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already expanded two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which aims to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will be able to handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans will count on a mobile phone, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely what VMware, the American company, aims to focus on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which ran alongside the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is hurting hoteliers
The bare slopes do not concern only the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e skiers.
The lack of snow reflects people even from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why free rooms are still available in the Giant Mountains for all winter seasons, including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but so far they are afraid to make a binding order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud,” said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Anyone who wants to stay in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate to place an order.
Whoever prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is at his place until the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindleruv hoteliers only offer weekly stays on Silvestra.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let go and go for a short time.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly," Jandura said.
A free bed in all winter terms still offers a top-of-the-line travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That’s why we’ve already started some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> can also be offered by the Vrchlabka travel office, but there are fewer vacancies.
Good for the first fourteen days of February, the rest of the winter time is sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the rest of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed over the course of a week, Christmas will also be sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou can be occupied a little better than the waves.
We're about five percent better at that.
We have the last few places on Christmas and New Year's Eve.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and it is also sold well in February," said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Pecce.
Of the 80 per cent, the Hotel Omnia is occupied by a central parking lot in Jansk<0xC3><0xBD> L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the beds are still available in the latest Janskolazen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which is already occupied by about 60% at this time.
February is a little bit weaker so far, but once the snow hits, the interest in staying in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater part of the snow, the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e have yet to let go of the taste.
On Thursday, it is expected to cool down if there are any precipitations, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the heat has to come again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle workshop of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It’s just comical, with what scholastic effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the stupidest.
When he finally fused his much-anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it through a copycat from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not even dare to use the name of Bush's January 2007 statement as the name of his own declaration: "A new way forward".
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq, fueled by a civil war, as “irresponsible and in its aftermath a catastrophic decision.”
But in the months that followed, they showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and successful enough that it is not being discussed today in news reports about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful default than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked by field commanders, especially the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinational habit, harshly criticized the White House's heavy-handed shooters.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't get any better, so at least he hurt the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to take a pledge of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half of the increase will yield the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are adhered to.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are preparing to change their master every day, depending on how they like it.
Political institutions, even if formally founded, will remain only a black-skinned village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex given the opacity of relations, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor does the construction of an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, seem too real.
Obama’s time horizon will impress with his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that sending soldiers to the war cry for the purpose of "quick return home" will cause a miracle done here, only the soul can be truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, determining the date of the withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is falling short.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush subcontinent.
Another factor that is able to radically intervene in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions on Iran are not imposed, the United States will face an overwhelming question whether or not to try to resolve the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will step up to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only downside for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is still plenty of time left to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Goldman Sachs’ senior executives will not receive a cash reward this year.
This was announced by the company, which thus responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 senior managers will receive shares instead of money, which will be available to sell in the first five years.
In addition, shares may be taken from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to connect Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
“I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to go,” said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after giving away almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion CZK) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The company’s total revenue for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political topic in a number of countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge banker bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (about <0xC2><0xA3>712,000) with a one-off 50 percent tax burden.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women today in Stockholm took over from Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf this year’s Nobel Prizes in the professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin Hert M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Shostak, were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatrama Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize in Economics, won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was presented today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each of the laureates received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of winning the financial prize.
For each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more in each of them, the reward is divided among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to US President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway, this afternoon.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his career and he is also at the head of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to fight peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering retirement. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will welcome Finance Minister Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget model for next year, as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was informed by the President’s spokesman, Radim Okhvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday for his next term in office.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now gets to sign, the Czech Republic should handle a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the left’s proposals on money transfers and increased money on the salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has denied the proposals of social democracy that they are secretly increasing the deficit of the budget.
Between the left on the one and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a sharp internal political dispute over this, for which the question begins to be raised about the further action of Fischer’s office, on which the formation of which was made and the agreement reached in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that Fischer’s government implemented in the fall and that it is supposed to stop the government’s borrowing.
Klaus, who may but may not sign the state budget law, said at today’s breakfast discussion with the entrepreneur that politicians had been neglecting for a long time a “serious problem” that is “unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
He says he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be brought by a strong government that could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
The vice-president of the ODS, Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an office with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens no longer seems to work.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong statements".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek responded to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka government for this year would exceed 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD announced the approval of the state budget for next year's success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandel played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novel
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggle and victories despite some critics that the main role is played by American actors.
It tells the story of sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman in his life story.
Freeman said that nineteen-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in the film.
I said to him, 'If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The twenty-seven-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already created the leader of the slave-resistance movement, from which he eventually became a slave, the fictional president of the United States and even the god of evil in the Divine He's a liar, Evan.
A former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country’s president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and is the name of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on paper.
“I had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandela to shake his hand.
I found that when I press your hand, I take over your energy, it transmits, and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the bell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual submissions under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated positive reviews and the Oscar ambitions are also discussed.
Film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secrets of Radiation Over Norway Dissolved: Russians Tested a Rocket
Over Norway it was possible to observe a special luminous effect of unknown origin.
Russia’s defense ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near Norway’s borders.
However, the start was again unsuccessful and the missile, dubbed the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the backbone of the Russian army, slowly becomes a black plague of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava did not fly at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was the 13th attempt in a row, normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was another technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was floating below the level of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was actually knocked down by Bulava.
From the very beginning, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The general defends himself this time and claims that there can be no clear talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket were sustained and the accident hit only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Even though not a single test start has been made without a mistake, only six out of thirteen of the defence ministry’s leadership is considered unsuccessful.
Almost fifty percent of the general’s success is therefore met with optimism, and he still claims that Bulava will once again fly without problems and that it even carries up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetish has signed an annual contract at CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again perform in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will appear in the KHL's Friday duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1>'s injury, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei N<0xC4><0x9B>m<0xC4><0x8D>inov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will be about just one game.
I think that Fetish is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said the Germans.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional ice hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford's legendary forward Gordie Howe, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven World Champion titles, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also made great strides in the NHL, where he won the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit jersey.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has made it to the experts. Cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai’s carrier car has agreed with the industry to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that the teams announced a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai carmaker Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the experts on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, this is essential, so a voluntary timetable was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two exchanges being made, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who process the Saturday exchange offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back to work on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they are allowed to pay the surcharge on time or they can choose a replacement holiday on December 28th, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by the day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday exchange will receive paid rides and lunches.
Given that overtime was the most mundane and heartbreaking point from the point of view of the comments and complaints of the experts, and of the protesting employees, which last week stopped production vividly, the management of yesterday afternoon decided to postpone it with immediate effect
The employees of the car company were forced to work out an additional two-hour overtime almost every day until last week.
Following the signing of the agreement, the strike emergency committee withdraws
Further negotiations between the management of the carmaker and the experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the departments, Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99>, said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the car worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike because of the incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management reiterated that overtime must be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The experts, in their strike emergency statement on Monday, also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, the post-company professions require to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 kroner this year.
Hyundai’s No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice carmaker now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production of the company began last November.
By September, it had produced around 80,000 cars, its current production capacity being 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes on ‘contaminated’ HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of an improved substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact prevails in some cases over the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral replication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiwalled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Faulty and resistant virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease caused by the cleavage of the HIV virus, mature infectious viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of drugs against HIV protease has been tested in the testicle and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on a common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, but its effect is not lost for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of effect and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications so from metallocarboranes make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says <0xC3><0x9A>vl<0xC3><0xAD>n and <0xC3><0x9A>ve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>che
A fight over the budget. ODS got into Fischer, he defends himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, called the approved budget for the next year "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as a strong statement.
He seems to have time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the Czech SSR, ODS and the Green Parties no longer seems to work.
According to Nechas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit, or whether he will remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nechas noted.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than SEK 12 billion.
The Parliament increased money for the salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s response to the proposals for social democracy has been to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG left the hall before the vote, so fulfilling the government’s wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government is still assessing the current situation.
There is no time to believe that if Janota had seriously threatened to leave the function in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He indicated that he was considering further stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer speaks out for the next fight against the budget deficit, according to Nechas, the government has nothing to do with the Czech Democratic nominees, who have implemented changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves further laws on the increasing deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the renewal of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the ODS did not attend
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated for the ODS did nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in the deputy functions of the people applying for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He did not stress that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the higher deficit in public finances, “it is entirely logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority currently in the House.”
But he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it was up to date, I’ll deal with it,” Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the House of Representatives, who had just been nominated to the government by civil Democrats.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS withdrew
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would apparently vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the MPs of the civil Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not see ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS did not make it difficult for the president of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic to be present during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it was mainly about the Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself responded.
According to the new order of the <0xC4><0x8C>D, there will be fewer trains for almost the same driving
Since December 13, the Czech Railways will cancel or limit some of the less-weighted accelerators and locomotives, while other connections will be strengthened.
As of the date of entry into force of the new timetable, the total transport volume will be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most of the fares, including basic and customer service, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava get more connections to the capital, the tracks on this route add one set of pendolin.
On the contrary, the speedboat will stop driving to Bratislava.
There are also fewer express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route, and the direct connection to Prague - Letohrad is limited.
From the regions, the roads plan the largest reduction in transport in the Kralovehradec region, a total of eight per cent, on the contrary Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy growth.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and the operation of several express trains on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovi<0xC4><0x8D>ti have to cross into Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the route from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Central Station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce several SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart in two-hour intervals.
Pendoline to Bratislava will no longer be connected with passengers as of December 13.
This year’s regional railway account: 200 million more
The rapids are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total for the compensation of the so-called demonstrable losses will give the costs of next year four billion kroner, as well as this year. Locals order the regions, in total they will pay next year eight billion kroner, with less than three billion kroner.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The tracks have a newly concluded ten-year contract on the locomotives and accelerators, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why it seems that the prices of the vast majority of tickets have not increased.
Changes will occur only on one-day network tickets <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again be based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine gunmen still detain more than 50 people, children released from prison
Armed men in the southern Philippines today kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which originally reported only 65 abducted.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially persecuted the kidnapper for the violence that required the settlement of accounts between the two local clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, 57 people were killed in the recent massacre, a permanent right was declared.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the governor’s office were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) comes to American cinema, which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, who was said to have chosen Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The men's next role of legendary South African rugby champion Francoise Pienaara was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film to the cinema, they emerge from the comments of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahl Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
It is a great expectation, as it comes to the public at a time when in the Republic of South Africa, however, preparations for the World Cup in football are being peaked, but at the same time the media is shaking alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the Chernobyl region.
According to the AP news agency, the comments on the new film in JAR for the time being are all positive, despite numerous reservations over the cast of the main roles by the “smooth” Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed about this role for many years and he was well prepared for it.
I’ve also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to – as they say – soak up his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and message with the film.
It is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
The film is based on a book by British author John Carlin with a loosely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential election campaign.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, tries to crush two racial and long-term population groups, as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, during the course of the film, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby union at the scene of the World Cup.
For the entrance to the lawn in a suit, which is understood in JAR almost as sacred, Mandela gathered fourteen years ago a large ovary mostly of the Belarusian public and gained recognition of the Belarusian population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR will improve will only show up.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as, for example, in a recent interview for LN revealed rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer is on fire for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was ignited in the morning by a transformer from <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a divorce settlement near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk.
According to the spokesman of the Uzbek regional fire brigade Lukas Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later the opinion was reassessed and the fire ignited a mixture of water, foam and special flame retardants.
The cause was a technical problem, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavly Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be calculated precisely until the end of the fire.
According to Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’s operation, nothing similar happened, the defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to a Czech company spokesman for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holinger Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, electricity supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or companies did not affect the fire of the transformer station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates in the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorced with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission to the distribution system and the 4,339-kilometre-long guidance route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file criminal notice for three hejtmans from the Czech SSR
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today filed a criminal notice for a speech on three socio-democratic heitmans.
And this is for Michal Hask from the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nk from the Pardubice Region and the hetman of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura put it in the 20 minutes of the Radio Journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Drams.
All three heitmans are attacking us and talking about picking out puzzles, and we only brought an offer for what we wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we just have to defend ourselves.
It's for an apology to the Student Agency, said Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura Radio.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all regions that they have not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
The criminal notice has been filed by Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura as a continuation of the media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and my region, and to the same challenge as other hetmans.
I suppose that, even on this occasion, it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Hashek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it is investing several million kroner in advertising, which will draw attention to the unfavorable step of the regions.
He told the radio that the campaign will be interrupted after Christmas and he wants to continue in it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Drams and on the order of about 150 billion kroner did not write tenders.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar actions are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>urov was also threatened by a member for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know which gentleman he is talking about, I will not say his name, said today to Radio Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccinations against pneumococcal cancers from January gather experienced habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time non-binding.
However, there are already rumours that vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peaks.
The Institute of Medicine already determines the maximum prices of vaccines that will be paid by the health insurance companies.
Experts also have a clear understanding of the vaccination process.
New Vaccinations
Vaccinations free for August children
From January onwards, children born last August 2nd and later can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal pneumonia.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay for another revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcal pneumonia.
The parents paid 1600 crowns for one or more doses.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccine doses.
However, it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccinations.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all flat-line vaccinations of children.
The vaccine was introduced in the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infection in our country will die in a year, according to a study in hospitals of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children have been vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it is to be played by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that vaccination would be better.
His association with the pneumococcal vaccine has long been promoting.
The experts at the international conference, which our association participated in, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the path we have to take now," Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vladimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, President of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, recognizes that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children were vaccinated, we could consider reducing the number of over-vaccinations "For situations where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand fairly well the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," Cach<0xC5><0xA1>e says.
Experts expect their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia by more than 80 percent of fresh parents next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is the first flat-screen vaccination of children by a health insurance company, not a state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thereby saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with other vaccines.
However, some MPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to “take money out of health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for the insurance companies to flush them.
According to estimates, individual practical pediatricians will invest 40,000 in vaccines per month, which is a significant sum.
It won’t be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
American artist's son 'stole in museum'
Frank Frazett, the son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazett, was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains.
Mr Frazetta senior, aged 81, was famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr Frazetta Jr. might have been motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
Mr Frazett, 52, made a solemn statement before the police, saying he had done so at his father's direction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move the images to the sweet spot," the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission, as the agency said.
Workers Are Preventing Planned Tax Increases
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditures announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tory “spend” the opportunity to show that they are serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the handicaps of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0,5 % in social security and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Disagreement on Social Security
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not call and warned in advance of “problems”.
Social security is on the rise - an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion per year - which has upset the business community, who said it is a job tax, while there should be a focus on restoring the economy.
This increase, which is limited to these revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODY PBR
Social security will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation is worsening more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New tax 50% of banker bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small business write-offs
Reducing taxes on electric vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in the level of pensions by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the state financial administration, some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be increased by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be a “captive in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that the growth of the economy should take place at the turn of the year.
But preparing a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise the previous amounts.
In a statement, he said the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
“A missed opportunity.”
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning against the workers' "crisis of indebtedness", called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan unsustainable over the next six years.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid off, they added, "cynicically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it."
" All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the Tories, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are “sand-based.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said on the timing of the announcement - for example, the inflation above will increase and there will be an inability to pay the doses next April - that it could lead to the prosecution of the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was raised to pay off.
But the Labour Party insists on providing special assistance if people are in dire need of it and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
The Suspected Budget
Although ministers did not disclose the details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognized Institute of Budget Studies said that Chancellor’s figures suggest significant cuts in many areas, potentially in the future include transportation, higher education, and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," said Roger Bootle, Deloitte's economic adviser to the account reviewer.
"It was a report of a suspect's preliminary budget, and the markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates 'U.S. Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan of five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were arrested for assaulting a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, according to the BBC's U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were declared unaccounted for last month in their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the other one comes from Yemen.
“If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were detained there,” Kelly said in a statement.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their conduct here and whether they are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house had always been in the interest of the local police and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, the Reuters news agency said, but said the United States "must work much harder with Afghanistan and Pakistan to cover up the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train individuals."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the past 20 years, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report describes in detail the “modes of torture” in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was bitten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of this report on human rights compliance.
Officials have described this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens have been killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were bonded and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
Tehran-based BBC correspondent John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayyatollah Ali Khomein<0xC3><0xAD> declared some forms of torture unjustified and prohibited them from being carried out in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent has stated.
Untruthful Confession
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old student in the field of computing Ibrahim Methari as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They were often in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran’s senior state officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with another 75 people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate contingencies and government reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the monument in Bristol into a ski track for the race.
The ski track for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the piste in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski bridge 100 m before a long piste.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said it was a beautiful view from the top of the piste, but that it was really catchy.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
“There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talent,” he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the piste.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
They're still with us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minarets and widespread reports of Europe’s alleged Islamization spread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslim societies could integrate – and whether they would integrate – into one of the world’s continents.
After reading this book, some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French don't like hats on their heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of controversial issues that divide and occupy the country for 15 years and have been around for a long time.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now care for 5 <0xC3><0xB7> 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim enter the marriage union in the mosque or in the town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and gay rights?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system in order to obtain a mortgage?
These are seemingly world-controversial issues that are being discussed and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, not excluding Tarika Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed have come to the conclusion that this group is an anti-Selafian group — supporters of the Sunni Islam purist group in Saudi Arabia — that group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
Adaptation, however, requires compromises on both sides.
It begs the question of how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which so clumsily defends the secular public) are actually devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he discovered “the pulling of the screws of values.”
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The Most Unfortunate Views in the World
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
Bordering ice hides alarming speeds, which has an impact on animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, in his book "On the Thin Ice", resembles the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes a long tradition of polar explorers who have tried to master the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a courageous fourteen-year-old swimmer who fought only with a flask of musket is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in a single circus tent.
Even today, the fences in the zoo typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where he hunts from helicopters and Indians on skis and all are armed with powerful assault gloves that fire their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unhappy responsibility of science for the Arctic and a compelling aerial view of how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have the answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of testing.
Research trips by Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time the movement of floating ice.
During the Cold War, the Ponorks then mapped out the moving gears when they were submersed.
Satellite survey and extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being done thanks to unthreatened individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks at the extremely fragile world of the Arctic ice shelf system, created by the melting of salt water, which freezes to a crisp.
But from the height of the above bear to microscopic miracles except, all this is doomed to extinction once the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 members of the Marines laid wreaths at the tombs of Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other members of the Marines, who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the tombs, it was the day that he gave away the hold to men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
"In the months we're in, it could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me so that he can show me respect the way I try to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans' cemetery in several wards during the drinking act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester's Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the funeral in Arlington.
Now it’s an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen embark on this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, but they are also looking for money across America, which they are betting on in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, Pentagon Territory, Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and Flight 93 United Airlines Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has dedicated more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that this was her way of returning what the victim is doing.
"It's a small way that citizens can support our units," she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Trapped in warm fabric coats, the volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding lawns and forts.
Volunteers went to the older tombs from World War I and World War II and from the war in Vietnam, as these are not visited as often as recent graves.
The mood was positive when the children were playing and holding hands together as they were transporting the young pine trees to the rough gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red collar on the top of the horse.
Close to Section 60, where the majority of veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained truly silent.
The combined service organizations devoted 1,000 devotees to decorating the department, but the gloomy mood of the just-running wars filled the area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read names out loud, carved into stones, while others leaned forward to see little black-and-white nouns pushed into the wet mud where tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of their son’s grave.
She traveled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the site of the last rest of the sergeant of the artillery, David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... ..my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. Government Supplier Imprisoned by Cuban Government Officials
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Some charges have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious criminal offences.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms. S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so that she could take over the price, but her permission was denied.
The detention of a U.S. supplier may be the result of growing tensions between Castro's communist brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been followed as a "holding tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day’s wages.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, have to announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of Americans in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for criminal acts such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbenov<0xC3><0xA1>, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs Berbenov<0xC3><0xA1> said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Watch program, who recently published a "bad news on the freedom of the Cuban people," in a press release.
Vivanco stated that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely when the two countries are heading for wider dialogue.
Pakistan’s state administration officials are swirling over a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of the conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. troops and said they hoped that the case could help crack down on the Internet.
Investigators said they were looking for a grey insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of those men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks has a YouTube video.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the area of Pakistan's native tribes, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani news official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had been unsuccessful in persuading al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were banished for a few days to the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the dangerous mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered to be a striking unit.
Why they were planted, said the official, who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the enforcement of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who stayed in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has placed the highest priority on attempts to locate human resources in al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, exorcising those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be interrogators.
U.S. fake recruits were subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in what will allow them to join them, as U.S. news agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we try to break into these groups, there is no better way than to proceed according to their recruitment model, which has already been so closely watched? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodani, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets on Saturday and called for more climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Convention Center.
Protesters cited the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small parcels near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day that a small incident occurred in climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e., a second-rate) and one in Spanish, which proclaimed "Land of the Rivers."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who stated that she had travelled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the uneasy state of the country, which is taking part in the impact of climate change, which is still taking place.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great movement -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot still be avoided.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching Bella's centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they had either been wearing masks or had handcuffs with them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the unattended viewers, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, masked activists as athletes and in black clothes placed several objects near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They moved to the buildings, he said, starting with lights, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact, it's something I'm not aware of).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the history is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched as to whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
It is to be seen the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: “It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other people.
Test Date Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding the public education of the District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, evidence has shown greater progress among fourth- and eighth-grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Attestation Center for Advancement in Teaching are the persistent differences in the knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both on the local and the national side.
The average result of white fourth-grade students in Columbia County over the past two years has increased from 267 points to 270 points (out of possible 500), but among their African-American peers there has been an increase of only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge gained actually increased from 53 points to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant deviation of one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 grade points (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
Some education advocates in the district said in the last week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D), were more widely stimulated among white students where the results were already high.
That would indicate that we have increased the support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equal trust in the district.
“I’m not going to jump up and down because of a gap of two or three points,” said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Often critical of Mrs. Rhee’s management style, Mrs. Brown said that the report on the test results means high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see bets, and I respect that.
But what’s amazing is that we didn’t spend almost any time and energy on our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said the district’s effort is to continue looking for better ways to focus on the needs of students with low results.
With this fall, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading basics, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at students of upper-class primary schools and high school students who have not been able to master the basics of reading before in their career will significantly improve their reading skills.
Everyday mathematics and the basics of teaching mathematics in the sixth grade, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that have come to the district behind former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the pinnacle of progress of the NAEP, which was reported last year.
And I just think that we should continue to work and do the best we can with the students who remain below the class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others said that the results of NAEP explained the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain won-out dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
In this way, the focus can bring political lessons that are directed against an important agenda.
But the excerpt, of course, belongs to other city directors who try to maintain a middle ground between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen the affinity of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be confident that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to exercise school eligibility.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his association of teachers last year for a 185-day school year, which he considers a "sign" to look for a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The shuttle bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, performed and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Graciel’s parents hardly attended a college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never stepped onto the floor of the college.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where the tuition was $38,690 per year, their position was rather than scaring visitors with enthusiasm for potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they were exposed to the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited on their three-day tour and were now completely intrigued by the future report: The question is not whether you will join the College.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem with the high number of children born in the U.S. of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "spirit generation" of Spanish students from the class - remarkably achieved results indicate that many of their immigrant parents, most of them Mexicans and residents of Central America, arrived in the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of view for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of the country’s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and an innate prowess and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to graduate – especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and the ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention in each individual point will not solve it, says Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, University of California.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school-age catch-up network in all ways to go to college.
The federal program, which funded Graciely’s rail trip, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to run subsequent preparatory programs that start for students from small-income groups in high schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, this program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than 1% have joined the colleges, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil Industry Reaches Agreement With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to force major oil companies to rebuild their short-lived infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The agreement concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies indicates that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, hampered by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone with capital participation to two of the 10 exported fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on a field that was auctioned in June.
The large share of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies you have here in the first place on the way to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be long before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by Tuesday’s massive coordinated bomb attacks and political instability, as well as the U.S. military’s withdrawal, are likely to reflect U.S. companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has arguably the third-largest raw material reserve.
U.S. firms have in some cases been at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil industry ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
China’s National Petroleum Corp. has been involved in more contracts than all other companies and has left with large stakes in contracts on two main fields.
“We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as a technological force,” Assad Jihad, a spokesman for the oil industry ministry, said in a statement.
We are convinced that Chinese society will be comparable to competition and worthy of its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry at the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaeda’s top planner was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile near the Pakistan-Afghan border was reportedly killed this week by a top planner for al-Qaida operations, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As it has been confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in North Vaziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the rockets had been fired from a drone without the CIA’s type of crew operating in the area of illegal native tribes.
They were referred to a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency that was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said the local gunmen had reached the point and were quickly amused by what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terror officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was posthumous.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking planner for al-Qaeda’s military operations, which operated terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in re-election around the world, said a senior official, who did not want to be appointed, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by al-Qaida's top leadership and on the basis of them was planning possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia acted quickly in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a widely known person for some Americans, but he didn’t in any way humiliate him to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban to be killed since September, when Najmudin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes and three other top-level operatives were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to the Long War newspaper, a website run by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people suspected to be informants, the site said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kabul has resigned.
The U.N. High Representative for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March and end such a turbulent period of office that has been marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the U.N. presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegation said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the state reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now said he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it's high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban started looking for compensation.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Misturo, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election over masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "certainly damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" at the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for coordinating efforts to relieve the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries who would lend them to the Afghan mission because, as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the difficult U.N. hiring regulations undermine its ability to exploit its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran Faces Other Sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers were soon imposing “further significant sanctions” on Iran over lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to the war-torn areas of Afghanistan and Iraq, was undermining the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question for probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether or not I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is an inconceivable unpredictability in war.
Obama’s administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and prohibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from sanctions, he said.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it fails to bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN nuclear safety committee and its nuclear watchdog agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his enriched uranium stock in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administration has established itself for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because of this, says the expert, because the Iranian leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, when it comes to Iran's assertiveness towards the international community in the case of some proposals that he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think that this was brought about by the international community, including the Russians and the Chechens.
On December 31, President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seek other elections, including monitoring, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that the Iranians wanted to continue their talks with the parties.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to an oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
It continues to have a high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially because of its borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce potential for conflicts to prevent the suspension of U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish concerns over the ongoing depression, and U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying, “We want to protect your security, prosperity, and autonomy in a united Iraq,” to the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government, Massoud Barz<0xC3><0xA1>an<0xC3><0xAD>.
We don't want to leave you."
In ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to use more children" and "One more child means one more grave".
Then they got the lesson that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and the aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't leave anything for the other, says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China's policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously boudoired and spoiled children, affectionately dubbed "small emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy went into effect, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population is 60 years of age and above, is predicted to grow stormyly from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
Disequilibrium is the largest rich coastal city with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while births were less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workforces in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it's not about being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual sedation
As it was introduced into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever introduced by the Communist Party’s governments.
The couples who violated politics faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have promoted a policy that has helped the country prevent the country from critically drawing on natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned to pursue policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their stance on the politics of one child.
In 2004, exceptions were usually granted to the extracts - including city residents, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they mitigated the dictation of their passwords, pushing a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage multiple births.
Almost overnight, posters encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how the second child would be eligible and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent officials to plan for families and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and toss airplanes under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officials said.
A humiliating response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai reported an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the urban districts did not report changes.
The urban district of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still only expected to be around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a down-to-earth network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge a child’s policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with her first child.
Yes, we were tempted to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
The other couple state the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also a single mother: “We were the center of attention for our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we did not want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, said it was much more covert.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced childbirth, he said being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20s and 30s adults look at their parents as going through the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and don’t want this way of living for themselves, he says.
It is just one child who places enormous demands on the time of the parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be satisfied with one child, Che says, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unproven attitudes and mutual glare -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document proposing an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with the most industrialized, non-combustible greenhouse gases.
The text, which may provide a basis for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unsurprisingly outlines how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global warming should be that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
That delivers a great deal of flexibility in the process, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, summarized the 180-page text from the talks to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent year-on-year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union on Friday agreed to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
On Friday, however, he also introduced the same kind of verbal firearm that prevailed in interviews last week.
U.S. special envoy on climate issues Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions restrictions for industrialized countries compared to the volunteerism of major developing economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signalled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China than Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "settlement intelligence" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" would lead to a standoff earlier this week, Wednesday.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, the taranics have collapsed both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current fight is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than about preserving the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations are warning that the two dozen of the world’s most influential countries are ignoring the impetuosities of scientists.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent their emigrants from getting off the ground.
It is a clear game about the development of new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international protection of nature.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "has triggered a political pressure on the entire political process" in part because they are now united and demand action from the economy.
The negotiations triggered a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government were contesting the deal.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and walked through the halls of the Bella Center to closed meetings and new conferences so that they could determine the demands that will be judged.
The total scope of the assembly—when 13,000 people moved every day from and to the convention center, on guitars playing activists staged an ironic look at the countries they thought they were sending them out—and they did not squeal with a handshake.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state were present in Kodani.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy at the International Protection of Nature.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first train at 140 miles per hour re-evaluated Monday's feeling
at 5:13 on Monday morning the equestrian cut through the darkness at the sign of the departure of the train, which marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London’s St Pancras and exceed the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal kit outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Abandoned standing water should reduce transport times in personal and commercial transport, and the transition from airplanes and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to win for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, an inevitable fight over projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now stalled the construction of British high-speed rail lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the route of the next planned high-speed network stage.
The new route linking London to the West Midland was designed to be within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where access to the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also expects to determine three options for an extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is the Y-shaped configuration, where one high-speed track should lead to the western Midland.
The route should be shared near Birmingham with one branch running from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
'It seems that the most efficient choice has been made, 'he said, and the railway expert.
As soon as it is finished, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already being proposed to take trains of 400 m in length, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to service up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital limitation, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded in such a way as to encompass the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis announces whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if it moves the wheels, the grid should be built on parts.
The trains should first be put into service not on high-speed routes, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers paid off a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory orange
Alan Duncan, the holders of the Tory front-seat bench in the House of Commons, paid taxpayers <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in expenses last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
A spokesman for the party for the prisoner, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "out of allotments", increased his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, and so Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of member expenditures, was not questioned. Last night Mr Duncan said his demands "may have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two two-storey houses on all in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
On the ground floor is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is referred to as "orangeries" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "glass for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupil security on a <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 mortgage from his London estate to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month in the interest of the mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
Interest on the payment of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgages could not change at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payout fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with it remaining.
The latest document from municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month this month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret lawyer filmed him and said MPs had to survive "for granted" after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on assignment and treat yourself like a s**t."
He said: “I lost money for my garden and a claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim all that damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it "may be considered over
One of the activists dug a livre-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night to raise the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: “It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authority and subsequently Leggem.”
He added: "This is not a contentious matter of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or something else.
It's absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
That wouldn’t have been a lot of other ways to be cleaner or simpler.”
Come all carefully to view the chat on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the spiritual exploitation of creativity has called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use the Christmas tree as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to view the last chat from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, and the Bishop’s bread and boiled wine provided free of charge.
Selected collages included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, when the cottage featured the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant to television marketing from Hove, is a non-student priest in the Chichester Diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to foreign old buildings? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
“The idea of an Advent calendar in the huts came up just like an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Kodani and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated around the world and in Kodani, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand, according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a deal that could enter into force by Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilisation, whose clear evidence is current manifestations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the march, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began to break through the outings with tiles and hammers.
The police immediately took a serious hit.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested “no matter what” and stressed that about a hundred of them were “held in the streets on Saturday evenings” and even over.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly set off for the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up, before which a spiritual meeting was held at candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to the Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, created the first assembly in the morning in Kodani, at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "fair climate".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of ecological debt in favor of the south,” said Lidy Nacpilov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can no longer say: it’s time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying out, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world has approached ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the characters in the fight for another world, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "conducting climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organisers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, walked in red clothes, and with hats evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets with the demand for a significant measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frag"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step a “frag”.
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the turnout was a few hours before the election rooms were closed by 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including the incumbent President Sergei Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
These choices are a straw.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "sadly that Abkhazia completely fell into Russian domination," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants was recognized only by Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through the elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlanov<0xC3><0xA1>, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>.
She was one of those who came to vote in an election room at a school in the capital of Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is the main topic of presidential elections in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagaps are placed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who have come to oversee the successful conduct of the elections, received a warm welcome from district mayor Beslan Arsby.
"We, Abkhazians, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament and drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimbou and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, has criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a 10-year deal that allows the Russian government to control the country.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, events in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding global warming deal to be adopted at a conference in Kodani, where around 700 people were arrested by police around the world on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organisers showed in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries, which could enter into force on December 18, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly set off for the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up, before which a spiritual meeting was held at candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, there were incidents shortly after the march, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break out.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, while several protesters clashed with the country.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
In the late afternoon, one police officer on his jaw was wounded by a brick and four cars were set on fire near a squad near the incident, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians here, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, created the first meeting in the morning in Kodani at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "fair climate".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of ecological debt in favor of the south,” said Lidy Nacpilov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.

Oxfam has called on several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organisers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes, and with jokes evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated in front of the city hall of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a call for urgent action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that subjects of history and geography will be "reinforced" within the framework of the reform of general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the final year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all will have the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end the hypocrisy", because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact science" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
The EC and L specialisations cannot be for what sub-specialisations, he continues, and stresses: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would find it difficult to learn geography and history in the last year of professional gymnasiums."
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by the journal Humanité, showed that seven out of ten (69%) French do not agree with the government’s project to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in the graduation year with specialization S, and therefore many of the intellectuals and intellectuals of the class.
The Minister, on the other hand, added that he "does not consider" abolishing philosophy in the program of specialisation of the Maturity Year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and faculty) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against this project, which they say is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
Within the framework of the Master’s degree programme 2 (M2), an entrance examination focusing on their field will take place at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year a further examination verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year they will perform in front of the students as a professor-trainer.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions procedure, you will gain more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, continued.
The minister also announced that he will propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reconfirmed the project for the cancellation of the school map until 2012.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole Normale Supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, which is a one-day seminar made up of fifteen-minute contributions by experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and on the basis of which they should be more eager to learn something more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after the student from the local lake.
About twenty contributing experts from different disciplines are selected, and he clarified that the choice is based on their charisma.
“We can talk about climate change for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-recorded remarks, using graphs alone.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
The videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and the next one will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry supervisors in jails, planned measures
The prison guards' committees announced Friday a "general mobilization" as they demand that they be paid bonuses and overtimes for Christmas holidays, the compensation of which was postponed for financial reasons to January.
The prison FO (2nd supervisory board) asked employees who will not have the service to attend the demonstrations on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities, and to “block” them and thus alert them to “the theft of their wages”.
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd Department of this sector) has called for "calling for gatherings in individual prisons and initiating substantial mobilisation" with the fact that it is "shameful and unacceptable" to "overtime and allowances for work at night, on weekends and on weekends".
The first supervisory bodies, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilisation (...) with the aim of expressing dissatisfaction and outrage".
The Directorates of Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mariov<0xC3><0xA1> sent a message to the prison guards’ offices, in which she assured them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister in her message.
I have ordered the Directorate of Prisons to take immediate action to ensure that the situation, which was created by mis-evaluating the number of overtimes, will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mariov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
December’s salary will therefore be low, with the exception of management workers who receive a famous reward for performing the function and fulfilling the goals, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those “there will always be a place in the budget”.
It is simply a scandal, angered by the interregional FO union in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott the appeal of "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays, unless they are paid for these days from October in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
“At a time when we are being given more and more jobs and tasks without being made available to other staff, it is sad to allow those lowest-ranking employees to pay for it,” the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux said in a statement.
According to experts, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better at it than others.
However, in any case, financial means are scarce, said the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He's Giving 'Best Gifts' for Christmas Than He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided to the "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke at the special edition of the show, which will air on Sunday evening on ABC station about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged family companion, gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said, with the dog also "of course" getting a gift, as it derives from the excerpts from the show's previous broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claim on the quality of the gifts, which she receives: “No, I certainly didn’t give you a good gift last year,” the president said.
Well, that's of course true, he was forced to agree with the president, but then, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked to their husbands about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a 10-speed transmission, but also a basketball that he dedicated to his Kenyan father at Christmas, with whom he met only very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come and look at us at Christmas and how he gave me the basketball,” the president said.
It wasn’t long after that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady once again remembered the doll house.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I straightened out all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" caused by a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station stated that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "an injury resulting from the operation" of a blunt-cut fence he had undergone in Paris on November 26.
The singer's press department, however, tried to calm the public and said the situation was "under control" and announced that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was introduced to artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
Within 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, RTL delivers.
The Press Department, at the request of the AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
The RTL also states that according to "some sources" no drones were located in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a severed hernia.
The surgery, which had been scheduled for several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
The doctor, however, was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a “wrong time” but added that he “doesn’t care” about the rocker because it’s a big “fighter.”
“He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on the plane after such an operation is no fun,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed down, saying that Johnny Hallyday “reacts well to antibiotics” and that the infection was “stopped.”
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer’s health problems have only increased since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on “a small tumor of the small intestine” and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dement the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships on Thursday in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the championship, on which the last combinations are allowed, fell only three world records, although much more was expected.
One of them was beaten by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrastov<0xC3><0xA1> at a 200 m position race and the other two men's relay Russia at a 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made his mark on the world record in a 50 m freestyle, which is already a holder in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, won the 28-year-old Frenchman with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the premier started ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Dragan (20.70) and Russia's Sergei Fesikov (20.84) but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore combinations made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1st.
Since February 2008, the combination has helped 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in a large swimming pool in summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400-meter freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsem Glaesne (3:35.82).
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Romanesque sarcophagus plate belonging to Zol was auctioned for $1.5 million
The Romanian sarcophagus, which belonged to no one but the French writer Emile Zoll, was sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than it was estimated, the Sotheby’s art dealer said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high frontal plate, dating from the third century of our year, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysus scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satire and bakchanty is a rare work, there are very few similar pieces in the world, maybe four or five," said the AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still going on, but it’s the subject that came up the most, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was discovered a few days ago.
It was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated with it a bath in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the minister of the Third Republic in front of France and before the Nazis.
There she remained in the shade for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the museum database in Louvre that this plaque was part of the "remains of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
A failed attempt at President Zelaya's departure from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico ruled that the conditions for the transfer of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, which rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelayou last night, everything so far is proof that there is no way to implement this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, flew back, a source at the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The Puja government wanted to force President Zelaya to "depose" and to seek political asylum abroad, only in this way would it provide him with the possibility of safe departure.
But the deposed president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The Puchi government "has experienced another failure when it wants me to give up my functions ... they want me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which it often expresses itself to the political crisis that has been taking place in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a couple of chords.
Mexico’s embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told HRN on Wednesday.
“I’m not going to ask for asylum in any country,” Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
"If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people," he said.
The news of Zelaya's departure was mobilized in the middle of a ouster of the deposed president, who came to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the Puja government’s stance.
They thus show their marginal attitude towards international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized as part of the preparations for his re-election to the public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congolese.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and will be responsible for the crime of the "velezrady" from which he is accused, the Punic government claims.
On November 29th, President Roberto Micheletti was able to hold a presidential election to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by the countries of Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Leads to Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the U.S. trade balance showed an increase in both the U.S. and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final conclusion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegzov from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on U.S. trade balance numbers, “which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6 percent in October from $32.9 billion in September.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the decline to rise.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has dropped “to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
The yield of the state treasury with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 years increased to 4.492% versus 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime chanted "Women in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime wrote on Thursday the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further demonstrations in which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were written directly on the street of Raul Castra's supporters as they marched towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scandalized by a raised fist of supporters of the regime to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted into the civilian population, who came to "ensure security".
The day before, a similar demonstration against "Ladies in White" took place in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, police officers were detained in the civilian area of about ten dissidents, who were also going to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police ordered dissidents who had been drafted into the government regime's civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The holders of the European Parliament Prize for 2005, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be “soldiers” or “agents” paid for by their main enemy, the United States.
A final miracle, Cuban television brought a report on Thursday's demonstration of government supporters against the "resistance of the revolution".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and the one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A gunman killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A gunman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of her, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A seriously injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Syndicate at the hospital following an injury.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the assailant attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of thirty, her husband began to defend himself and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other victim is in danger, according to police sources, the vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two other people, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two knife cutters carrying a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance’s trade union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several others, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the crazies, according to the testimony of the assembled AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old boy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown into a crowd, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man while being wounded by a fist, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The next day, I was told that there was an injured person outside.
“I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed big wounds on his stomach,” Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later came the second, about thirty-year-old, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who had no identity card with him was arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the regional police investigation department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for an interrogation.
A police source did not rule out his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said that six police officers were needed to seize him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was “completely beyond himself” as “all the madmen of this type whose strength in action increases tenfold.”
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer again calls for an end to criminal prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) asked to stop a criminal lawsuit against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence for ants and ants.
Chad Hummel, a legal representative of the director of the film "Pianist", criticized three judges of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in California for the serious mistakes that occurred during the court's coup at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel, adding that from the behavior of the judge who was then in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a chill in the back."
According to him, a judge (who had already died in the meantime) before the verdict was handed down had allegedly to deal with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and asked), from the mouth of the state representative himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will ask for a court order in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said in the first State, namely that there would be no serious investigation into the application for suspension of the criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on an “illegal sexual relationship” with an underage girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
The Los Angeles prosecutor’s deputy, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski “should be there to take part in a court hearing.”
In this case, we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also the other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "demands the court's favor and at the same time despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make the decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel was not the only one who asked to stop the criminal prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also called for an end to the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal anguish whenever Polanski’s case came out, adding: “No one in this room can say that the trial was fair.”
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. order
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a domestic prison in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is waiting for a possible release.
Wall Street Ends Without Direction, Stops Rising Dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a direction, the market fluctuates between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance left 0.55 points and finished at 2,190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly speaking, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has greatly decreased and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that “helped improve the mood in the market in terms of the stability of economic recovery,” summarized analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November, the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month.
However, the indexes have been stalled by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "pulls down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
So technological actions lose the ground under their feet.
The stock market has fallen.
The yield of the state tax with a 10-year outlook increased to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook increased to 4.497% versus 4.492% the day before.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty took place in Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilberta and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen during their African stay Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a true belief in events.
It was great to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in the Republic of South Africa after the ninth, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 hours of world time).
I could not dream of a more beautiful country in which I put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I've been able to experience it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For a young Russia, her second stay in the Republic of South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its “country that breathes out”.
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to be in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who will also be selected by Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will feature Chinese television host Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to welcome the world with warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates, like last year, took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zum, who shook hands with them.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which has helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never even dreamed of.
I'm sure I'll be back at the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi excitedly.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
News of Johnny Hallyday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It’s very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday as he boarded a plane from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. world time)
The singer’s son, who acted calmly, said he would “get as quickly as possible” to the Los Angeles-Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital, which Johny Hallyday was admitted to on Monday because of a post-operative infection caused by the operation of the cut-off intervertebral cord, which he suffered.
According to a press release, the singer spent the night in Los Angeles because of the comfort of being "leaded to artificial sleep", which is meant to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles already admitted to artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection after surgery of a swollen intervertebral hernia held on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at night.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended the school performance of a French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which their daughter Jade attends.
Yves Catoné, head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, said he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who operated at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were in a riot, Camus said.
I've heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
Personally, I spoke to the doctor by phone and he assured me that this path is not a problem, which surprised me a lot, because I myself had already suffered twice with the cutting of the interbratal fence, he added.
A moment earlier, on RTL radio, he said that the singer apparently flew after a Paris operation without a drench, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he worked on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematoma caused by bleeding to the brain.
He is, however, also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical board, called him "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical board, and who can't even be "recommended remotely".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had a "totally good course" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with the questioner.
It is clear that the deadline for the planned resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) appears too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to enjoy their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bayrou, on Friday reacted to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to attribute the former Giscard party to the fact that, in short, it should not be used in any media under threat of punishment.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own the short UDF with the fact that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to carry her legacy after handing it over to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was scheduled to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) on Saturday.
This step was supported by a member of the Hervé de Charetta (former UMP now NC), who is the owner of the UDF brand because he first registered it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprietoire industrielle).
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF-run friend Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bayrou, who does not intend to be expropriated, stepped down from his silence and made a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand over the property to the security authorities.
In the last few days, you have raised the alarming statement that you will propose to your political movement + take over+ the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarou.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement to immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) websites.
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement of 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "choose" a departure in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as did others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The New Centre movement therefore has no right, according to them, to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "if he registered a trademark", "he was not a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used non-existent registration of acronyms to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracy begins to turn into a criminal act, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come up with an anonymous name for fraud."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to sue the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise-Marie Banier and decide whether to use the state of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to prepare her for part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames her for.
A photographer (62 years old), known for his famous photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision confirms that the process will indeed take place in a case that can be referred to as the family saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which a mother and daughter are attacked together and fighting for control of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who was supposed to conduct a college of three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre State Office during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should prepare the report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give a statement as to whether or not Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness, and in what period.
I think he's going to get it.
I'll talk to her about this, said Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As regards lawyer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Oliviera Metzner, the court welcomed the decision.
It's an excellent report(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady in need of protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter filed a criminal case against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist who has been accused of using her mother’s weakness for years to gain a billion-euro donation in the form of checks, contracts, and life.
That’s why Liliane Bettencourt has always denied that she would be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's speech by lawyers changed for a moment into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, expressing her distrust of her husband Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to her lawyer, adds, "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Since she married, I've never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise."
The representative of the State of Nanterre again found that the complainant’s actions were not justified, especially since the guardian judge in those days rejected her request to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to attend court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigny, the prosecutor’s office’s representative.
Finally, the court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers's statement of entitlement would be made at the time the proceedings were initiated.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile.
For more than a decade, it has reminded the management behavior of large companies towards employees of companies' access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying employees with the "values" determined from the mountain, as was previously the case, when it was necessary to produce
By becoming the center of business companies, the customer has compared the marketing revolution to the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...even when authoritarian efforts to impose products, unlike customer preferences, are returning on a regular basis!
The passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of the much more widespread general phenomenon that primarily affects management cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all parties involved (...) active approach and the ability to predict" and requires from employees a commitment that is completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to bring employees to the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys of public opinion.
Will internal surveys of public opinion – as a questionnaire submitted to Orange’s employees – contribute to a revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mostly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after various turns will return preferentially to... what she always did!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most of the executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of the convenience of thought, they acquire an old behavioral theory, currently revived by "neurologists" from the United States and widely disseminated without greater knowledge by the scientific institutions and media.
With it being possible to move the "paths" (sic) of the involvement of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos showed on the website Figaro.fr, which only establishes the management staff in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It is based on the inclusion of a basic insight into all the plans and practices of management : for employees, commitments to the company will be possible only if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of motivation of employees is concerned only with the study of Motivational functional analysis.
These studies have shown that it evaluates its business on the basis of a pre-determined doxy, which allows them, through an image that speaks about the business, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, management employees can control, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resources management “on the right track”.
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: “A just war” Obama deserved the praise of justice.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of a “fair war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who first laughed at Obama’s award on October 9, praised this time’s presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former candidate for vice president in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the right-wing Republican muse, to USA Today and added that she herself expressed herself on the topic of the “sometimes necessary” war in her memories that are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists have to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday justified the deployment of forces in Oslo and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan ahead of the ninth.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president’s mention of the “existence of evil in the world”.
In my own way, I considered this speech to be entirely historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see the "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the prize to the masses.
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama presented “a very American speech.”
Not only did he introduce himself as a "global citizen" as always, but he "spoke as American president" and reminded the Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they are not doing too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
A few of the few disgruntled right-wingers include the Bush-era hawk, a former U.N. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who described the speech as "one-size-fits-all, bubbly, and uninspired," as reported on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is horrified at looking at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of force.
“If we wrap the war up in the guise of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press is holding a congratulatory opinion against the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider awarding the peace prize to Obama prematurely, he considered his output to be a "surplus" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision-making in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Obama "made the speech as necessary," the New York Times reported, and the speech labeled it "simple and instructive."
Road transporters: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies at Christmas.
After three marathons, there were road transport teams and TLF, the only employer organization that remained until the end, on Friday evening of the agreement, which ended the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies at Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators split early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
In spite of the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting, which began at 11 a.m., for everyone to agree and at 18 a.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would seriously hurt businesses" and "threat to disrupt the holidays by the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it,” explains Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we give our members an order not to block, not to block, supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month at the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros at the highest.
It’s a common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed a “historic agreement.”
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of 13th payment and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "100 million euro reduction in corporate tax" that was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which he voted on Thursday night to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "appropriate" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only slow down the disapproval of employers’ organisations.
The FNTR is talking about the “wrong trade” because 100 million euros “has already been offered to the sector as part of the compensation of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to take emergency action not because of mutual analysis, but because, in order not to inflame the dishes of the crow in the time of the approaching Christmas holidays, complained to Unostra.
For the organization Otre, the deal threatens to "bum a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months."
RER A suburban trains: traffic disruption over the weekend, departments dissatisfied with RATP’s proposals.
Interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday’s negotiations between the departments and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the past.
On Saturdays and Sundays, that is, on the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 and 20 o'clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will run every other train, except this section only one train out of four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette’s stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP was trying to secure a connection with big business houses.”
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train of two was in operation at the top, and practically no set-up was driven out of the top at the time, as planned.
Just like on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion at the entrances.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things also because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29-year-old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he woke up about "an hour and a half earlier to make sure he was on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, predicting a greater number of organizers and guards of the order.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut came or left from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
Further election meetings of the strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon’s meeting with the leadership, which the departments rated as “weak” will be evaluated.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career path, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who claim a prize they deserve, according to Thierry Garon.
RATP has even postponed proposals on the premium for the time being, which worsened the CGT with the management "not being able to solve the problem, while for the carriers and SNCF it did".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the terms of the profession will be reviewed more closely", RATP transport companies clarified.
Which was the reason why experts think the company is "making fun of weekend commuters."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company’s board in its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "relaxation".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread on the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent announced a strike emergency.
The professions apply for premiums ranging from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are convertible (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independents)) and weigh on the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports a million cents a day.
The drivers of suburban trains RER earn in the more advanced career period 2200 to 2700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences for the Kurdish side.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to withdraw the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked a protest in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The ruling was unanimously passed by 11 judges, who needed a majority of seven votes to dissolve the party, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Turk and MP Aysela Tuglukov<0xC3><0xA1>, were banned from taking part in a political campaign.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP side has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party's leadership has already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political competence.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the cassation court Abdurrahmane Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “commandments” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be terrorist organizations.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is a legitimate political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party maintains that it has no “fundamental connection” with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict.
The leadership of the DTP confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a renewed tension in southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been thrown out against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, which is predominantly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov cocktails again or fired stones from the works.
There were also hundreds of people in Istanbul.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr. Turk said that the decision of justice only "deepens the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ed.) by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, formed by the party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are in principle against the interference of the parties.
It's not working, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete reflection of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
It's a pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES’ winter technical services department.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control the whole of the vehicle technique.
This could be the first time this has happened, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
The FES is doing exactly as planned.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt overall and temperatures drop below zero, they go to the 20 so-called sections of the A velkosyp<0xC3><0xA4>che, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit lines such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and descending sections such as Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES begins at three o’clock in the night, “so that the roads are free until the transport to employment begins”.
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because nobody is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when there is so much snow, there are a number of arrivals and connection communications, among which Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e also includes.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain there.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians leave for the road, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES is usually not able to take care of all cycle paths.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that watches from 22 to 4.30 especially bridges, says Brauburger.
Because they form quickly ice cream, the caterpillars will leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also be called if necessary.
Category: Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other masochistic dinosaurs: The animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high ran along two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sharp spines and sharp spines.
If this species lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about family relationships, expansions, and early dinosaur signs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is invisible to triassic sediments, says a member of the Randall Irmis team at the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones quickly identified scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: “The fossils of triassic dinosaurs are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found.”
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This particularly sensational finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurus is often controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards were divided into three main developmental lines: masochists of theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-tailed" quadrupeds of the orchids, and their antlers.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers have found evidence of air sacs, which also have the descendants of theropod birds.
Thanks to airbags, breathing birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have argued that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development were soon divided and expanded from South America to all the continents that, at the time, as the supercontinent of Pangea, formed a unified Earth mass.
It would also speak for the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods.
These three cannot come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also disagreements.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, and they are rarely found on other continents at any time.
As the dinosaurs have proven that from the relatively rare sideline of the plazas have evolved into the dominant vertebrates on earth in the Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the beach didn’t.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push the competition out.
However, the success story did not last forever.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals that had also developed in the triassic and had lived in the shadow since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearance of an occupied casino at the Goethe University in Frankfurt has taken care of a worldwide outbreak.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, as well as colleges across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the precedent-driven police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art had been demolished, University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had the building occupied by striking students and lecturers last week cleaned up.
Five students were injured.
Injuries to the matter, the signatories judge, do not justify "violently dissolving the self-organized teaching of students and teaching police command".
Exclusion is an "unacceptable interference" with the freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “unlawful and criminalize protest” and draws attention away from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for the cessation of criminal prosecutions.
It is claimed that the majority of the attackers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi and the German Association of Professionals are also supported by the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about one’s own future, says the secret youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesse Minister of Science Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmannov<0xC3><0xA1> (CDU) is currently defending the process of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Parliament.
“We have an understanding of protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism,” Peter Beuth, a member of the House of Commons, told CDU.
The opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left have seen it.
The CDU takes a painted wall as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a purge.
Linke submitted a proposal, which calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district is considered to have a population of 216,000, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Greenwich representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits took place and on Wednesday signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow Majority-General Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoliy Smirnov, for Frankfurt by the head of planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ will be able to compete in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get jobs in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large Citronics Group and Rossijskaya Elektronik.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape into which research facilities are installed.
Stuttgart's brakes
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
All right. S21 is more than starting a station, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, which ended in the city centre, were then considered a 19th-century transport-technical fossil, which acts as a brakes for modern rail transport, as it took a tremendous amount of time to overwhelm the locomotives from the rear.
Take a moment, stop, move on - that's how it should work.
That is why the main stations are missing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about half the route of the Trans-European Railway Master’s between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – that’s why the slogan is “the heart of Europe”.
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavarian capital, the start of the construction is almost non-financial.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with commuting and commuting.
However: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was established by local and local politicians.
The roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic is borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
A new urban space will emerge, which – if we believe in the computer images of designers – will contain a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
Cross-stations and track construction are intended for personal transport, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must, however, be primarily about enhancing freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than a truck on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to the rapid ascent.
Even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion was to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be real.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of finance for other nodes and narrow places in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route to the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, there has been a slow pace on this route.
There's got to be a steady push here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The R<0xC3><0xBD>na valley route will become the backbone of the international freight transport bottle: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport.
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Land Parliament whether it will go against the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights and allow it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport, the state would have to re-adjust the night flight ban.
The 17-year permit between 23:00 and 5:00, as the Land Government foresees, is not in conformity with the law on the protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised the postponement and urged the government representative to resign from the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights that she gave before the election. Otherwise it can be considered as a "violation of the word".
“It’s damn hard if you can keep your word,” Greenpeace chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan, “We hold our word.”
Minister Posch rejected the Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel excerpt, and the country’s government is trying to get to its night flights by “crossing rights and tricks.”
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
The statements of his faction on the ban on night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. Banks Pay for Help
U.S., crisis-torn big banks are getting rid of government bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund.
According to a report by the US station CNBC, Citigroup also plans to pay state aid.
The constitutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that happened by accepting money - the restriction of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has worried investors thanks to the exchangeable bonds of well $19 billion in clean money.
The rest of the amount was taken from its treasury, which was filled, among other things, thanks to professional sales.
Kenneth Lewis, the bank’s chief executive, thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: “Money injections have helped us overcome a difficult time.”
The Monetary Institute has damaged itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations towards the state by also depriving money in the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around $20 billion as early as Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to say that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for the aid.
Quick-choice
It just went faster than expected.
The station presented its successor only two weeks after ZDF’s board of directors pushed Nikolaus Brender out of the office of editor-in-chief.
Last night, the grémium wanted to agree on that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to prejudge the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter if this proposal did not pass by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he squandered on Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract for another five years with Nikolaus Brender.
There were only seven members who voted for Brender, seven against him, and Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, although she was to be expected.
The EU majority in the board of directors has signalled a few weeks before the election that it does not want to confirm Brender in office.
The protest against the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that the monitoring quotas for the ZDF newscast had fallen behind Brender.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time even 35 state lawyers were involved in the debate, who judged Koch’s procedure as unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk in Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 writer in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of ZDF's main studio.
After Brender, who was selected Wednesday by the expert magazine Medium Magazine as a journalist of the year, was segregated, Greens announced that they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch’s opposition candidate on the board of directors, the Rhine-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant’s personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, spoke to the board of directors with a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's session, he strongly criticized the guild for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing his face as Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is without a doubt a left-wing liberal.
Study Gets Rid of Haramp<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xAD>
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, the Ministry of Culture finally entered the federal countries on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed that it is willing to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: In principle, each study module should be terminated with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a "real and defensible degree" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between higher education institutions in Germany and abroad in order to do so.
The federal states undertake to create more flexible common structural tasks for the bachelor’s and master’s study fields.
The earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university rectors have had words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board has found that the number of tests is partly drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed only once a test", according to a 30-page report, which is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of study fields.
“A significantly lower test load,” said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, “is to stop the wrong development, which significantly limited the study’s complexity.”
To this end, the "hardness of study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content have to be "hardly checked" so that they "necessarily do not restrict the student when choosing"
of seminars.”
Students should have "a place that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules shall apply to the approval of new fields of study, but also to existing fields of study after review.
These need to be “reaccredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 before all study fields are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation councils set up by the federal states.
In October, the Culture Ministers called on the Federal Republic of Germany to act on the agencies in such a way that the curriculum was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the Land Ministries on the appropriate measures.
As yet, the only country has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Out of the money, universities should pay primarily for consultation programs and study advice, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010 he wants to submit to Parliament a draft of the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, it should be guaranteed the recognition of exams from other universities and the accessibility of the master's degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study fields in the country should be re-examined.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition renegotiated on study conditions in the country.
In addition to the praise, the criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups of Juso called for the creation of an education policy not to be played out in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, “at least a word should speak to this” should also students as affected persons.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelov<0xC3><0xA1>: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom HRK was a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), Bonn’s resolution has not gone far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a postgraduate master’s degree.
Second, the federal government must ensure that for today’s generation of undergraduate students, there will be enough space for tomorrow’s master’s degree programs with the best possible study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves in favour of free access to the master’s programmes.
More than a note under the spell of Hert M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, which in this excerpted piece of language thematicizes the experience of the accession of one dissident who has gained his own freedom, but always
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing company, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesse Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a considerable extra-literary outburst last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts."
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, apparently ill-fated and infected, left a statement in which, before his colleagues, the Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, acknowledged the cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service.
Together with some of the present, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit, he said, began unsurprisingly, first in 1971.
I am, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner continued, "someone who has not defended themselves sufficiently against attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
Poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is Walter's secret agent.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize by Hert M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, it is a literary scene, and in particular a community of German authors from Romania, shaken by the scandal and the politicization of the deafness, which calls the deafening
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is not, at least if that can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the acts of Securitate, said after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of Secret Agent Walter on himself.
"He was pushing me at all the points that mattered to him," says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement was in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but it is not entirely surprising the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote in July, reading her own papers, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate peaks.
The evidence, it can be assumed, will be speculated and in some cases even know which name is hidden behind the cover name of Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the country, in the meantime, a very certain view of the components of Stazi, the manipulation with the remains of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
Over the past few years, systematic lighting has been limited and limited.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issuance of the act has been going on rather protracted since then.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law that governs the management of components.
The fact that the former members of the Securitate still have a great influence in Romania has been demonstrated after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert M<0xC3><0xBC>ller in an interview in which one of the former heads of the Securitate of Temesv<0xC3><0xA1>r expressed his disapproval of the award holder.
She says she's psychotic, but she's only been interrogated once.
The confusion of power has been expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, as in the case of a silent charge, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession makes it possible to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the aggravation of guilt and study.
The genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a remark under the spell.
Satisfied deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a cleanly dressed sales representative from a cute Christmas party was coming, at which he distributed the manufacturer of sports goods sweetness, when he performed a quarter of an hour after midnight in the summoned Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
A man with a marked ball made him drive after him in a foreign city.
Otherwise he could drive by himself - alcohol was not in play, and luckily the 55-year-old man was also few.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it's just starting.
The words of only three days engaged Switzerland: "Although we have reached the eighth final", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the assemblage."
The "far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mohuchi the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And avoid repeated obvious weaknesses after three quick goals Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Disposal
The Champions League eight-finals (matches 16/17. + 23/24 February/ defensive games 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of Babbel’s sudden arrival will be preserved.
Not only for the supposed healer, who added self-confidence, willingness to use and joy from the game to the undisputed Stuttgart professionals in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I begged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, but by the action of the therapist Babbel no longer proved any effectiveness.
He relished some magic, admitted Babbel’s adjutant Jens Lehmann, “when a new impulse comes to football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn’t consider possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after a long break caused by injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamism immediately the best player on the field, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new mastermind, "He's the mastermind.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Apparently, it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before there was a nasty wake-up call after a 0:4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal was scored in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not after the water yet.
The fact that Heldt didn’t celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win after three months was caused by weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
It’s a decision that others do, not Jens,” Heldt replied to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He was ahead of the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the games, Lehmann called it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, and announced the consequences for the defenders.
The two forty-somethings will no longer have the joy of life.
In any case, they are in agreement with each other that without the work of an established coaching team it would not be possible to play such a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share in success", Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the needle bag agrees.
Battle of the World Cup in heavy weight
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson has constantly challenged the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remains the world champion in boxing in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern by a unanimous vote on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, this did not happen to the C.O. that everyone expected.
Klit<0xC4><0x8D>ko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice being defeated by injury.
The Johnson challenger was defeated for the first time in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena, the 2.02-metre-high Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko fought mainly with his left hand.
About eleven centimeters smaller than Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, but stepped down before the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
Overall, passive Johnson did little for the challenger and only tried to get into the other rounds.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka provoked words and gestures, but his hits hit the world champion only rarely.
But it is still only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka full of twelve rounds.
Before the battle, the challenger took care of the outbreak in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka as a "resisting zombie" who "doesn't know anything properly".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champ let himself be provoked, pulling Johnson out of his nose sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
The fourth victory after Klitschko's return
The Klitschko remained undefeated even after the fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin, Nigeria, and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defense and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically I was in good shape, Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka justified a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye after he sat down from the 2.13-metre-high Nikolai Vulayev throne in November.
Haye denied in the summer the fight against Klitschko, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Leader of the opposition: Green Party chief J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin called the Kund<0xC3><0xBA>z minister of defense a liar for misinformation.
The SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has admitted to a deliberate deception.
The Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously untrue", said the head of the Green faction J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin in Saturday's news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: LHAL.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the NATO report that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In a U.S. attack, which the German commander of the Kundazu Colonel Klein demanded, a NATO investigation found that up to 142 people were killed or wounded.
Greens, SPD and Linke on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately speak before the Federal Parliament and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Parliament - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the news service approved this new strategy, called on J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Party.
The government of Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor’s office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the portrayal of the ministry on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneider and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were correctly and completely informed about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence sensitive details to the minister.
The two top officials, however, said they had even alerted the defense ministry to several reports, including a bipartisan document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had to request clarification of the situation in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
The ministry did not comment on the withdrawals on Saturday and pointed out that this will be resolved in the Federal Parliament’s Investigative Committee, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only mentally ill or in drug addiction are the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fanciful delusions.
However, those who experience the alertness of the dream state, see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, in today’s Western world, usually pay for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a stranger.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
Wine has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, here and there will make sure that they cross the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the better case we call them vision, in a worse confusion.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, however, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of the brain's neural transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken, and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between insomnia and sleep has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucination as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great similarity of delusion to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it rises at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling numb.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood red grimas, appreciating teeth.
He chases him, digs into him with heavy, fiery shoes, throws him against the wall, feels pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices are threatening from the wall and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that offend and insult him.
Henning T. removes two wires from the stereo, takes them into the loop and attaches them to the hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop allows.
Teach yourself, with a loud chorus of voices shaking his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is maniodepressive, taking medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Miracles are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people have schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the handicaps can usually no longer distinguish the inner and outer world, they get into an overwhelm state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
Voice hearing is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment, or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The disabled is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as the dream opens the psychosis of the building flood thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning focused on it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics are therefore often at risk, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is not possible in most of them, miracles are a terrible reality, awakening is ruled out.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “but the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved.”
Blurred thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Scientists are still faced with the question of why our brains are doing such a thing.
“Exceptional states can cause any person to lose a relationship to reality in the short term,” says Fuchs.
However, not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that the affected people have minimal damage to the brain.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example by the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains to be seen how the neuronal system will break down, which has not appeared for many years.
The role also plays the influence of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains are shutting down
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
If we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die unreale Welt in n<0xC3><0xA4>ssem Kopf" (Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying manifestations of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, sporadic sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are often also common.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain of a healthy person.
According to Kasten, hallucinations consist of contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or under-repressed; if our brain is jammed, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also relieves stimuli, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, she married up to a third of respondents who had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attends a gymnasium.
Actually, she's a normal girl.
If it weren't for the forms and the voices.
About the breaks, she may be approached by a long, dark haired cocoon.
When she answers him, the fellows look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This naughty girl is considered a drunken dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and he disappears again.
At night, the apparitions are more convulsive.
There are often overloads.
When she sits in the classroom, she can’t watch the lesson as many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new companion, but he explains to everyone else audiblely and visibly on the table of mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are more squeaky.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he can not often tell if he is awake or if he is already asleep, if the images he sees are grimaces, or a girl with bloody cuts on her hands and feet, or if they are standing in front of him.
Leave me alone, yell at those characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vlon has matured and lives with his friend.
A year ago, the hallucination stopped.
Ever since the psychologist Kasten contacted her on the internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone mad.
Disappointments are also art of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or has been taken from them, they will be more likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man her father has called since he thought he was her own father is not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain regions that process also real cues and sounds are active, it is difficult for people with disabilities like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear, so it works so realistically.”
Also, night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ significantly from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Boundary state between sleep and hallucinations
In our world too concentrated on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agonizing disease, but it also brings positivity, creativity - delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered sleep consciousness.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them back from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor impairment at full consciousness.
When one is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality.
The type of boundary state between sleep and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with any situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support of the senses and the transfer of the senses in some unbearable situation, which allows us humans to transform our own ability to form, in a moment to lose consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Changing the Heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after the heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplantation, his consciousness was released on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless on an intensive care unit.
Claussen dived into the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: he became an old man chained to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces monstrous substances from the blood.
On a motorcycle, he is taken to his homeland by the river, surfed on a ferry in the Alps on a hospital bed and met a Korean mafia.
It plunges completely into imaginary history, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are clear even after years, and in the insubstantial details.
Even clearer and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction, how fragile our inner images are even in the waking state of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, concludes psychologist Kasten, “can lead to the deformation of what we call reality.”
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At 27 they have to take charge of the children's publishing
Kallen’s new editor-in-chief is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand his business over to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company is expected to be 100 per cent family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We have dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only after that.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees at the head of their children if they are not capable enough.
It would kill both children and businesses.
Burda announced on Thursday that he has been stepping down from the presidency since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was concerned about technology.
Later, the Tax Department added responsibility for the company’s assets and after the resignation of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer also Direct Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to “bring us to 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
Holdings should also be 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that neither family businesses have any certainty before the demise: "It has always been the companies that have been plagued by the desire for capital that have speculated and thought that they can become great players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don’t want to play the World League with “Time”, these stores are too big.
Complex care for beauty
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and comfort, you have at your fingertips.
This was presented by El Corte Inglés, which has just started the operation of the Callao shopping centre (Madrid) with an area of more than 1000 m2, in which various services in the field of body care are provided.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where such prestigious companies as Hedonai are located dealing with laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane, offering additional services.
There is also a food department and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different types of tea.
You can also enjoy relaxing massages with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and ensure your own 'beauty party' in the company of up to eight friends, relax in a whirlpool, give a spa bath and a massage.
It is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, in which the above mentioned services are provided, as well as state-of-the-art procedures for face, body and hydrotherapy.
As an example, we can mention cavitation, which is used in the fight against cellulite, or vibrational platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers, who monitor the individual actions of the clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by placing a personal key in the contact display, which is placed against the machine.
After that, you can watch videos that will show you the correct implementation of our training set.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching) is sufficient to exercise all the muscles.
And if after the exercise we have a desire to go to the hairdresser, Luis & Tachi has a space where individual procedures are carried out to heal the hair, improve their shine and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionality are the premises of this city wellness centre, which is open every day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and this is the time to find out what celebrities are wearing, and customize their festive wardrobe as well.
The shape of the cut is very important to emphasize the character, which you need to be aware of.
We present a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa in Barcelona, with electric car
Energetic company Endesa together with the Barcelona City Council established 'Officer LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric vehicles in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE’ (Electromobility Logistics) office will establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will secure mobility agreements, draw up, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric cities’
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen as part of the MOVEL Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support activities in the field of research and technological development in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This also includes energy-related activities and, in particular, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'peacetime' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a “rest period”.
In the economic report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitive Plan for the automotive industry, we would be in a state of abandonment, closure of some of our main manufacturing companies,” the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry is expected in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the automotive sector (PIA), allocated 800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The President of the Government explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government’s measures on the aid requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed for a 6% reduction in the average level of emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles.
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of motorsport.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real spark plugs for collectors and enthusiasts.
The companies involved will be: Clas<0xC3><0xAD>cos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renovation; or Cochera Clas<0xC3><0xAD>cos, a specialized company of Mercedes Benz.
Tests of aptitude in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: conducting concentration, sports performances, test-skills, presentations and competitions.
Also, the test of suitability for classic cars and motorcycles will be carried out in a customized circle outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that caution towards the environment has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also christened as-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 hp.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics that it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
With the combination of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasted with the sharpness of German products and, more specifically, with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower with a six-speed manual transmission.
This motor is a real spark plug. It is very soft, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many miles a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater riding comfort and reduced fuel consumption.
As for the equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention 17 wheel track monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of pull and stability, control of speed, internal mirror light-sensitive, on-board computer with a large screen, air conditioner or screen,
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptive lights with a two-xenon and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more miles per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shine more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, serves only to browse the mail, without being able to browse a certain type of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine rated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on the permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, which was introduced yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming all over Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to miss out on data services after crossing borders or impatiently search for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no curtailed effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it’s interesting that it still has the name Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another great example, offering book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications, no complications.
This device is connected and is valid for purchase, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect will happen once in the case of FonPeek, it’s a possibility to purchase with a permanent approach like what Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I look at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think it's the best kind from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle loves.
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama’s appointment as President of the United States, she chose dresses and coats in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him to the second most important moment of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellowish green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a jacket of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or a scarf.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of entering the function Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
Changes and accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, a current-style model, but in a golden color.
She also wears various hairstyles: this timehard, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have labor problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'The Fertility and Work Career of Spanish Women', conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market due to motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth earlier, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone partner coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation with their partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have spent most of their stable employment and therefore had to postpone cohabitation.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although less impact on the time of beginning cohabitation with the partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of the marriage of the birth of the offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25,1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to their first child even before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education, on the contrary, prefer to get a stable job, before marriage and the birth of the first child.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of performers: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The cast of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to other famous figures L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, she joined this selected club of actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the cottage').
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent figures: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in "The Lost").
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of the writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases even in ordinary life) in 'Ess<0xC3><0xB3>w poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The path brings excitement and Vicent does not spare any distractions or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even when you read it over and over again.
Here are a few observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of adversity, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were a knife knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for thirteen years, lust, pleasure, and extortion, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 80,000 peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north, from which the best climbers often emerge."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
About himself, he said about himself that he was the heir to the county estate, and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught this man's confused shout from Munich on the bridge, so that he could carry his bell to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running away from himself and calling for the future and boldly speaking."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, let me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verse was engraved on his tomb: 'After the effort comes a dream, / after the storm a calm port, / after the war of rest, / after the full life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
Her husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the Azalks or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos have to do than focus Joyce on Baro?
What was it about Bennet other than letting Barro execute Faulkner's gun?
What was the matter with Cel, other than to become famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Terrified aggression
Last week my 70-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years old passed the knee and our dog, a crossman rescued from a shelter weighing a maximum of six kilograms, without a single word of his claws.
Our anger is so great that we don’t see anything amusing in such aggression against a small, defenseless animal that was also on the leash.
And to this end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she clashed with these individuals on the walk, began to worry about her own safety, for such a demon possessed man, who attacks the animal, is able to do the same to the woman, to the child, to the old man's sweetness.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was for something, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly killers were Spanish nationals.
The outrage has forced us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening to today’s youth when it comes to dealing with the unprotected animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We don’t understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people has been shared.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products," and confirmed that it is trying to achieve this goal in other ways, i.e. in the form of instructions and campaign information.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 motorcycle repairmen will be deployed to get to the attention of the general public.
In conclusion, Michelin noted that transport safety "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to constantly increase the safety of products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing.
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles detected in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the employers' organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Gafac.
However, it is better to quarantine the favorable data, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
As of January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/undertakings.
And neither did the clouds, which are the most damaging to demand, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost in 100% of the cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of the bad economic situation, need to be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support of the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the names of business owners of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they again reminded that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Sellers predicts that in 2010 development will be similar to last year and according to sales calculations for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the manual brake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be with the stability control of the ESP, auxiliary hand brake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly-seen passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, while in others there is a deadline for the elimination of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, and it works in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects after the driver slids.
But it can’t always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not slip the brake before the crash and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires a maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities per year could be prevented.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant—by calculation, one in four accidents with impact on persons—after the introduction of so-called smart hand brake systems would be prevented.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (with the help of radar or camera) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably April 8 – as Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer, will warn.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan agree with the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay at the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be made in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM is enabling contacts with some of the new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Baic, a Chinese company.
The decision to close Saab remains in effect at the end of the year if it fails to sell it.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
During the development of this fine model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of plywood was, first of all, plywood automatic roofing is plywood with manual control, which reduced weight by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminum doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg of plywood, air-conditioning less;
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, a single vehicle with a hand-stamped six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many turns.
His behavior can only be classified as untouchable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press into the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would at the same time carry such safety when moving in a turn, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete who is able to warm his muscles during a short ride for as long as necessary, until we order him a sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the motor...
Thanks to the control, which is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we point our hands at the wheel, is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine as desired
The sound of the V6 boxer, of 320 horses (of 10 more than the Boxster S) is very rewarding and it is possible to strengthen it with the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it’s during ingestion or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt roads that we ride with Boxster Spyder were pretty much destroyed, but the car managed to get through the wreckage well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and at the same time, in some turns, we encountered flashlights on the frost and cracks even in the early morning.
Definitely, this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it’s more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
"The Bag Girl"
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional ‘starlet’ on ‘firms’ tours, the singer shows her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The team won a brilliant 82-91 victory in their stay on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the team of Duska Ivanovice, and thus became the leader of their group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who scored in the top three.
The Society of Vitorie was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic with a large dose of dedication and collective work, although it had to endure until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the round with 16 three-points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began as a front for the blues, who had been standing on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for the Vitoria were from a distance, already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team decided on the inner game of Barak and the work of Elijah, which was accepted by sanding and applause when returning to its original position to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show up as the best in his 13-point partnership, although 'without six' in Splitter's assessment already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Maccabees wanted to remind Victoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elijah' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to making the 'yellow' return to pronunciation (50-49).
More Inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and in this appeared the machine gun Mirza Teletovic, who, with the help of English and Ribase, returned the score to a calming number (54-67).
The Alavians sat down in the last part and English and San Emetrio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter excluded from the foul, Ivanovic did not reach and defend well, and although the Israelis were approaching the final minute (80–85), the match had already been won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in Euroliza in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy Society did not care about the environment of the Pavilion of peace and friendship nor its rival, perhaps one of the most sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. The aggressive defense and three third points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, ignited the pitch s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in an internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams opponents meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez strained the Unicaja team.
Between the domestic players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, 19 minutes.
Impossible revenge
The third half was highly offensive by Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, proved a superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Malaga M<0xC3><0xA1>laga 66-48, the 27th minute, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who injured himself in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the lead and the three points Cook and the benefit of Lewis left with a certain hope of winning 66-57, the minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos proved to be unstoppable in his zone thanks to the strengthening and weight in centimeters.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja took the lead and handed it over to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engines with the largest number of classified ads in the area of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has available in Spain, using the form that is available on Facebook, where you need to enter a profession, years of experience, age and city where you are interested.
During the week that the app works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally “feels poorly rewarded,” explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data that Trovit has available from its search engines in the UK and France, Spanish are the worst paying.
The British programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while Spain receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the most paid work is a waiter with 11,592 euros of net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, half-time employment and social worker.
Brazil set date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for the survival of Manuel Zelaya at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The incumbent president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term of office officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the Brazilian embassy's chargé d'affaires in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and look for other refuges."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to obtain asylum in Brazil.
The operation eventually collapsed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, tried to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses from last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty again emerged in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where traders make the decisions themselves.
The drug used by the central banks to stabilize the market was the depreciation of debt by the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero, so that financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are practically over, and without question of their inconsistent liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the cocoon, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore question the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return to reducing risk yields.
The volatility of the stock market and the differences in debt write-offs have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk, which has once again been affected by public debt.
Once again, the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for selected investors, expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries against Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's qualification reduction.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the conscience of those responsible for the world economic policy for curbing the devastating consequences of restricting credit to employment, if the day would not have been the day when employment would have been a reality.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections, and a new government is emerging.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barros.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to default on their commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin is forcing the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to a common responsibility when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in the supported positions, they would be within the expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the debts of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are reduced and ours continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading pointers force most of the study services to take over their recovery scenario and revise their 2011 ascent scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese not-so-spook scenario, the
Again, it seems that this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, "carefully, fellow drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n was the first to speak before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is currently being discussed over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n made several remarks regarding the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommissions behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion by 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments would not be 60 billion million, but up to 95 billion million.
In fact, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments will have to focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and there will be a need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas stations and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the draft law on a sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, is in line with the line that the company has demanded, did not want to leave a vein as a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal, which opposes climate change policy.
In his view, it is a "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "exact" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to be made already now, because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport land services, Swissport, will play the role of a preferred partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation in the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures yesterday.

Acciona is seeking its first freeway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction of the tunnel is estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway company.
Town Hall wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan dedicated to Ernst & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the customs.
The tenders are expected to be presented in May, with the expected investment reaching 1.700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the final phase of the competition of three companies with a significant presence in European buildings.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction based in Italy.
Against the Acciona Group, Northern Direct is in the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group that went through the network is called LBRJV and is part of the Australian capital Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by the ACS), also the local company Baulderstone (ownership of the German civil engineering group).
The Australian infrastructure market promises great construction and privatisation, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy, which was guided by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona invests in a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, Waubra has the largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage the 700 million-dollar Adelaide desalination facility.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the area of construction and infrastructure operations.
The subterranean road under the customs authority of the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, named Northern Link (northern junction), is to connect the western highway from Toowong to the county route at Kelvin Grove (see map) at a distance of 5 kilometers from the tunnel.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to be set for the summer of 2010 and to start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane already offered this job Hochtief
Australia is still making significant gains in Hochtief as it announced a deal with the government estimated at 154 million.
Through its local subsidiary Leighton, ACS will operate the infrastructure of the national broadband network with a fiber optic cable.
This situation will provide quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-storey King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work had just begun and Hochtief closed sales for $129 million.

The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Mrs. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition written off by Renfe, of which four went to the final, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating ad campaigns.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
A fine of 63 million for France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million to France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
This sanction was a former French monopoly and the state company has bought more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for imposing obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority overseeing the competition believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that therefore there has been a relapse.
Trade with applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Play in the Champions League brought 476.4 million Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>e from the start
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has divided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5,362.5 million among 105 associations (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since the start of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he won to participate, and the only one along with AC Milan to win three times the main prize.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich’s Bayern, the two teams that also accounted for the most money to participate in the past Champions League.
And even though she lost both of them to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>o.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to earn the most money through the Champions League, although it has won the most titles out of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribuce
This seemingly paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
During this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is planning to make 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of these, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received $3.8 million only for their presence, with the exception of an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each match they took part in.
There is also a prize for winning (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive $4 million.
The champion will make 9 million while the second finalist will make 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won 2.5 million for a victory in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are mobile payments to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spain is one of the main cities and has four designated places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches to be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group announced yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to get a top spot between 25% to 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the purchase (supplies) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this discount 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer is valued at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Sos in the meantime changes the structure of its leadership.
The election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of the internal audit was announced as an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the court challenges of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazar.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from the controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos by the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto can’t be stripped of the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As for the Salazar credit, yesterday, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court that they had approved a transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were headed.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paterina, which was attended by Invertor Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved an exclusion involving Invertor Mer against Federica Paterninovi on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it allows this operation because it understands that its conditions are in line with the applicable standards and believes that the "enough" content explaining the brochures submitted after the changes introduced on 2 December is "enough".
The CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paterna at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been forfeited, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer was closed, specifying that the price had been fixed by Federica Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Tools for Car Valuation
In these days, storms and accidents not only earn car services.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance incident are pulled into a service where the expert must estimate the damage and cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be long and complex work.
Compute manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided to them by manufacturers, in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solara, is the leading company; 80% of the reviews are carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of tools for evaluating and developing sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Audatex’s business director, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very nasty job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, with each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "turn off" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be completed in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models that have information about them are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet in circulation, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight hubs worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specialises in specific brands to carry out documentation and database development work.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast stream of information enables businesses to use and provide different products in a variety of ways.
The most common use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but according to individual countries there are also tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual values of the car.
The only company that has a guide available that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offered in our country, but in the United States it is.
With a focus on the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus, the standard solution for awarding insurance events designed for experts, as a star product.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or varnish.
This tool is valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the device with which the assembly line was derived only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass is focused on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to exclude vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model-specific brands went through service due to an accident or how many suffered serious insurance events during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for the expert and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damage, accident or maintenance of cars.
Gt Guia rating is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% annually over the last three years and accounted for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of office installations in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its brother is established in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Solara’s global billing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood at $1 billion on the stock market and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of wrecked vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged a recovery of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to the huge international market.
This valuation and buying and selling service is only available to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, lenders, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who need to register before starting operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and operates more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been withdrawn, after a preliminary procedure.
The budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, create a budget for generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the convictions of professionals of higher age who, to a greater or lesser extent, are being restrained when using new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is needed for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it will, for example, allow you to choose a door and turn it around to show the inside side.
